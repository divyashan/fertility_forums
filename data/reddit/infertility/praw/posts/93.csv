I haven’t posted here before, since I felt like I was intruding on a space I wasn’t a part of. 

Today, however, a scan showed what is probably hydrosalpinges. Since both ovaries look to be affected, I will probably have to have them both removed - and thus lose all hope of an unassisted pregnancy. 

I stopped birth control early spring 2019. I have no prior medical history other than IBS. I had a chlamydia-infection with no symptoms in my early 20s, which may have persisted for months since I had been in a committed relationship with no reason to suspect an infection. 

My cycles are regular; 28 or so days, no heavy bleeding or abnormal pains. We sought assistance after having tried one year with no success. My boyfriend’s sperm analysis is good. My AMH is on the lower end - the fertility doctor said it was more like someone in their mid-thirties rather than the 25 years I am. She was still optimistic about IUI-H until she went to scan me. 

As my title states, it looks like I have fluid on both my Fallopian tubes. They will probably have to be removed. Thus, I am now being referred to IVF instead, and my wait time is that much longer because I need surgery first.

I’m sad, and I’m scared. I don’t like the idea of anesthesia. But I’m willing to do whatever it takes to try to become a mother. I will keep fighting.

I'm going for blood work as part of a monitored cycle tomorrow morning and pretty sure it's coming back negative, so I'm trying to prepare for next cycle. I have PCOS but otherwise heathy. Husbands SA came back great. I have tried a few things until going on injections last cycle and this cycle and that seems to be working great. When I met with my doctor the day of my trigger shot she mentioned that the clinic is opening up IUI and IVF again soon if this cycle wasn't successful, so I have a feeling she's going to suggest IUI this next cycle. 

I would love opinions on if we should move to IUI or try a few more on our own first. I feel a bit like we've really only had two cycles with the correct levels and everything so maybe it's too soon, but at the same time I don't want to wait any longer than we need to. I've heard conflicting things on IUI success rates vs timed intercourse so just curious what you guys think and if anyone has experience.

I am 31 and have had three losses, the third being just a couple days ago and I feel like I have lost all hope that I will be able to have a family. 

My first loss (2016) was a MMC at 6 weeks (diagnosed at 11 weeks), second (2019) was a chemical pregnancy w/ MC at 5 weeks, third was another MMC (2020) at 6 weeks (diagnosed at 8w4d). The doctor on this last go stated the yolk looked to be enlarged which generally indicates a chromosomally abnormal embryo. I have not had any products of conception tested. Also, it's relevant to add that I have lean PCOS that presents itself as anovulation, polycystic ovaries, and very mild hirsutism, but none of my bloodwork has been abnormal or indicative of increased androgens or insulin resistance.

Below is a list of all of the testing I've had done to date. Everything has been normal except for the ultrasound when I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries. My RE did note that I have an arcuate uterus during my HSG, but she said these aren't thought to impact fertility. At the time (2 losses) she said we could revisit whether surgical removal of the tissue would be logical if I had another loss. I guess I've met the criteria for number of losses now, but I'm still apprehensive about the surgery since there does not seem to be much consensus on the value of reshaping an arcuate uterus.

Does anyone have any ideas on what else I could request to be tested for? I know that immune work-ups are generally recommended, but we don't have a reproductive immunologist anywhere in the state and so if you've got suggestions on that hurdle I'm all ears. Thanks in advance for helping out.

I  hope you're all doing ok  -- I know today can be a hard day.  I'm  writing for the first time here -- I hope it's ok to share where I'm at.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

**medical history** \- before I began using contraceptives as a younger human, I had wildly irregular cycles. once I stopped, my cycles normalized, but remain a little on the long side (\~32 days). our diagnostic tests with my GYN and our RE revealed minor abnormalities but nothing conclusive: I had low free estradiol serum, elevated TPO AB; he had minor morphological sperm issues. we have no underlying conditions.

during the rounds of TI and IUI, I took varying doses of femara/letrozole, used ovidrel to trigger, and used progesterone and/or estrogen vaginally. my follicles generally took their time to mature (leading to a delightful number of TVUs and blood draws), and one round they even stopped growing and I had to do a round of menopur to kick start them again. in the first round of IUI, his sperm count was a little low; in the second round, high; and in the third, the numbers were off the charts. 

our insurance only covers TI; there's no coverage for IVF. to finance this, we're going to borrow from my retirement plan (we borrowed from his for our house, so fair's fair).

**treatment q's** \- we are at SGF and trying to decide between multi-cycle (2 ERs, transfer, freezing, and unlimited FETs, all for the low low price of $18,500K) or shared risk (6ERs, transfer, cryopreservation, lab analysis, unlimited FETs, all for the low low price of $19,500K). although the peace of mind of shared risk is appealing, multiple rounds of ER medication are obviously pricey, so I'm unsure if it presents any meaningful savings. how did you decide which treatment plan to choose?

because we plan to participate in a study, we will receive PGS and ERA testing, but we remain financially responsible for IVF, FET, freezing of the embryos and medications (including ERA cycle medications). in connection with the study, our RE is recommending both ICSI and assisted hatching. not that we have much of a choice, but do the rewards of ICSI and assisted hatching outweigh the risks?

I've seen a lot of posts describe the first IVF as ""diagnostic."" does anyone wanna say more about that? what did you find out that you didn't know before? 

**religious issues** \- finally, I'm Catholic, but my husband isn't. in addition to the emotional and mental stress, the grief, the financial cost, and the societal stigma around infertility, I'm also dealing with a lot of guilt and anxiety with my faith. I'm coming to terms with the fact that the Church offers no real moral authority on anything related to sexual ethics or reproductive health. It was easier to not reckon with this when we were doing TI (which is A-OK), or even IUI (which is not okay, but mainly because it involves masturbation). It's not so easy now, when I'm checking boxes on online forms about the disposition of embryos. I am telling myself that retrieving, fertilizing, freezing, testing, and transferring embryos with the help of ART gives them a much better chance than they ever would have had on their own, inside my uterus. after all, any embryos that we may or may not have fertilized never implanted, or if they did they never told me about it.

It&#39;s not so easy now, when I&#39;m checking boxes on online forms about the disposition of embryos. I am telling myself that retrieving, fertilizing, freezing, testing, and transferring embryos with the help of ART gives them a much better chance than they ever would have had on their own, inside my uterus. after all, any embryos that we may or may not have fertilized never implanted, or if they did they never told me about it. </p>

They are stopping to ""restructure"" but there is no planned date for re-opening and my doctor told me to stop all prescribed medications when I asked if I should start taking the birth control pill again after the Lupron shot wears off. I am an endometriosis patient so I should be taking BCP when not in an active cycle. Needless to say all of this is extremely concerning and destabilizing. I wanted to see if there were any other Sher patients on here to connect with and see if anyone has heard any more information or, for those in active treatment, what their plans are?

They are stopping to &quot;restructure&quot; but there is no planned date for re-opening and my doctor told me to stop all prescribed medications when I asked if I should start taking the birth control pill again after the Lupron shot wears off. I am an endometriosis patient so I should be taking BCP when not in an active cycle. Needless to say all of this is extremely concerning and destabilizing.

So, I went off birth control (IUD) a little over a year ago. I got pregnant our first month, miscarried (missed miscariage), found out it was a molar pregnancy, HCG levels wouldn't go down, did a ton of tests and was finally diagnosed with Quiescent Gestational Trophoblastic Disease. 

Basically my uterus is haunted.

If my HCG goes up, it means I have cancer, but it can be treated with chemo with great success and fertility, in theory, returns. 

Or, my HCG goes down and away, and with any luck, my fertility would return. 

But it won't. Fucking. Move. It's been months sitting at stupid fucking 7.  I'm in limbo. It's enough that I develop eggs, but can't release them, so they turn into cysts. There was a long shot method of putting me on birth control pills temporarily and that made me a psychopath and I started passing uterine casts (Google at your own risk, it's like cramping until your entire lining comes out in one piece and it looks and feels like you're laying a damn turtle egg). This qGTD can last for years.

Every month around the 15th I have to go in for a blood draw and wait a day, call in, and get the disappointing news that I'm still unable to have children. oh, and if I try, I could face chemo anyway and losing my hypothetical baby. Although there's another study that showed the HCG levels normalizing after successful delivery. It's so rare there's not even a standard method of treatment.

I'm in reasonable shape, not a smoker, very rarely drink. Husband had two sons with his ex that I'm helping raise so I know he's not (or at least was not 9 years ago) infertile. 

My neighbor is cute and fat and looks to be due within a few weeks of when mine should have been. I don't want to hate her, but she reminds me of how much I hate myself. They did a drive by honking baby shower due to social isolation and I lost my shit in front of my family and cried as hard as I did right after the loss. Surprise, you were supposed to have a baby brother or sister but they died. And I won't be able to have another one until you're a teenager. Maybe ever. 

Every month the 15th is just horrible, but I was supposed to be due May 19th, so this month is an extra dose of suck. I can't even get out and spend time with my friends because of the stupid virus. If the HCG does go up and I need chemo, I will be immunocompromised in the middle of a bloody pandemic. It's just a shit sandwich and I'm tired of eating it every day. If the HCG goes down I have to wait 6 months to make sure it stays down, so even when I gain some ground, I'm still in limbo. 

I'm willing to try ANYTHING anyone can recommend to get my body to balance itself. I also just need to get it off my chest how much this sucks without my family feeding me lines of ""oh at least you _______"". Or some silver lining bullshit. Infertility sucks. Loss sucks. I'm doing the best I can to remain optimistic, but I feel like the world is on fire and the one thing I want is impossible. It's incredibly hard, it's putting a lot of strain on my marriage, and I'm worried I'm running out of time to have a baby.

My husband and I have been trying for just under a year (this is nothing time wise compared to some, I know). But I’ve had a nagging feeling something was off. Today we got the results for his SA (results below) and motility is very low. I made an appointment with an RE for next month but they won’t even look at his SA until the appointment, and he leaves for a 6months military deployment sometime this summer. 

At this point I am beyond frustrated at the fact that we don’t know what his numbers mean for our chances naturally or with ART, and by the time we get an answer, we may have to wait at least 6 months to actually do anything about it.

Long time listener first time poster coming over from TFAB. I have posted in TFAB, Male Infertility and have done all the googling today. </p>

<p>My husband and I have been trying for just under a year (this is nothing time wise compared to some, I know). But I’ve had a nagging feeling something was off. Today we got the results for his SA (results below) and motility is very low. I made an appointment with an RE for next month but they won’t even look at his SA until the appointment, and he leaves for a 6months military deployment sometime this summer. </p>

<p>At this point I am beyond frustrated at the fact that we don’t know what his numbers mean for our chances naturally or with ART, and by the time we get an answer, we may have to wait at least 6 months to actually do anything about it. </p>

The ANXA5 gene codes for a protein that inhibits blood clotting and is highly expressed in the placenta (placental anticoagulant protein Annexin 5A). There are a variety of mutations of this gene that have been studied, but the M2 mutation in particular is connected to blood clotting disorders of the placenta. The M2 mutation results in ~40% of the normal Annexin 5 protein activity. https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/16/5/573/709076

The prevalence of this mutation is 10-15% in the northern European population to up to 42% in the Malaysian population. This mutation is positively correlated with RPL, and in successful pregnancies, with low birth weight, IUGR, and (potentially) pre-eclampsia. This protein is expressed in the placenta and either genetic parent of the embryo can pass it on where it has the potential to cause problems.

In a study of Malay couples, those who were carriers for the M2 mutation had a higher rate of RPL, and couples where both were carriers had an even higher rate of RPL, between 1.5-3x above normal rates.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5401693/

Of the most relavance here is a study that used a mouse model experiment to show that heparin adequately compensated for lower ANXA5 function. They then went on to show that treatment with heparin improved the live birth rate of couples where one partner was an M2 carrier. While the statistical power of the study was low, the combination of experimental evidence from the mouse model and increase in live birth rates is enough for them to recommend heparin treatment to RPL couples with the M2/ANXA5 mutation. https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/51566/1/1076029616658117.pdf

Everything including chromosome tests came back normal except for one test. I’m homozygous for the C667t mutation. My OBGYN said we could try again after taking folate for a month. He said it hasn’t been proven that the mutation results in miscarriages, but that 5% of his patients have had the same mutation and 50% of those patients have been able to carry to full term without complications.

After giving it much thought, my husband and I have decided to give this one final shot. However, we want to make sure that we give it our all if it’s going to be our final time. My miscarriages have been very traumatic and emotionally draining and we don’t want to keep experiencing the same path. My question for those of you in similar circumstances is: Did you move forward with trying per your OBGYN’s instructions or did you see a reproductive endocrinologist for further assurance?

After 2 Miscarriages since November 2019. My doctor had me do complete bloodwork work. Everything including chromosome tests came back normal except for one test. I’m homozygous for the C667t mutation. My OBGYN said we could try again after taking folate for a month. He said it hasn’t been proven that the mutation results in miscarriages, but that 5% of his patients have had the same mutation and 50% of those patients have been able to carry to full term without complications.</p>

<p>After giving it much thought, my husband and I have decided to give this one final shot. However, we want to make sure that we give it our all if it’s going to be our final time. My miscarriages have been very traumatic and emotionally draining and we don’t want to keep experiencing the same path. My question for those of you in similar circumstances is: Did you move forward with trying per your OBGYN’s instructions or did you see a reproductive endocrinologist for further assurance? I’m not sure what a specialist will tell us that’s different from what my doctor has... I don’t have the most amazing health insurance and my husband is uninsured. We live in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

Long-time lurker, first time poster. First, I want to express my appreciation for all of the emotional support and great information that I have received from this sub!  I am grateful for all of it and rely on this thread for so much of the research that I’ve done on fertility issues.  Infertility can be really isolating and lonely; this sub is a great source of support. 

I started fertility treatments at the age of 38 with multiple IUIs, moving on to multiple rounds of mini-IVF when I was 39.

Day 3 testing in April 2018:  AMH .09, Estradiol 23; FSH 16.  (Age 38)

Day 3 testing in September 2019:  AMH .45; Estradiol 35; FSH 16.11 (Age 39)

Day 3 testing in April 2020:  AMH .24; Estradiol 19.59; FSH 9.50 (Age 40)

I made some lifestyle changes over these two years -- getting my sleep to be more regular, moving to a less stressful job, reducing but not eliminating alcohol and caffeine, going to therapy to deal with infertility issues, taking DHEA, vitamin C, D, a Thorne prenatal, ResVeraCel, alpha lipoic acid, NAC, CoQ10, and probiotics.

When my AMH testing increased five-fold between the ages of 38 and 39, my RE's response was that “sometimes the assays can be wrong.” So much of our decision-making dealing with fertility issues has been based on these lab results. Saying that sometimes assays can be wrong just seems like an insufficient response to the fact that we used this lab work to make all of our major decisions on which treatment to pursue.

Saying that sometimes assays can be wrong just seems like an insufficient response to the fact that we used this lab work to make all of our major decisions on which treatment to pursue. Does anyone have any insight into the fluctuation with hormone levels?  This seems so odd that they would bounce around so much.</p>

Long time user here, giving away an unopened cartridge of 300u of Gonal F that expires this month. It's been refrigerated since purchase. Ideally, it would go to someone who is:

1.) Out-of-pocket for medications - I've been there, it blows.

2.) A long-time contributor to the Reddit infertility boards, or at least a meaningful contributor.

3.) Trying for success #1. Nothing against those who've had success before - that's the dream for many of us - I'd just like to help someone get to their first if possible.

4.) In the United States - just for ease in shipping, which I will cover as others here have done before in sending meds to me.

I know we have something regarding this in the wiki but I found the way it's broken down on this site very helpful. [Hormone levels](https://drmeaghandishman.com/female-fertility-labs-explained/)  I am not affiliated with this site or anything, just found it while googling my results.

I will copy/paste for easy reading. Again, remove if not allowed.

#### FEMALE FERTILITY HORMONE LEVELS (serum/blood)

**Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 3-20 mIU/ml**
   * FSH is often used as a gauge of ovarian reserve. General results indicate the following:
      * 6: considered excellent
      * 6-9: good
      * 10-13: diminished reserve
      * 13+: very hard to stimulate
   * In Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) testing, the LH: FSH ratio may be used in the diagnosis.
   * The ratio is usually close to 1:1, but if the LH is higher, it is one possible indication of PCOS.

**Estradiol (E2)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 25-75 pg/ml**
   * Levels on the lower end tend to be better for stimulating.
   * Abnormally high levels on day 3 may indicate existence of a functional cyst (normal) or Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR).
* **Time to Test: Day 4-5 of medication – Range: 100+ pg/ml or 2x Day3**
   * There are no charts showing E2 levels during stimulation since there is a wide variation depending upon how many follicles are being produced as well as their size.
   * Most doctors will consider any increase in E2 a positive sign, but others use a formula of either 100pg/ml after 4 days of stimulation meds, or a doubling of E2 from the level taken on Day 3 of cycle.
* **Time to Test: Surge/hCG day – Range: 200+ pg/ml**
   * The levels should be 200-600 per mature (18mm) follicle.
   * These levels are sometimes lower in overweight women.

**Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: <7 mIU/ml**
   * A normal LH level is similar to FSH.
   * An LH that is higher than FSH is one indication of PCOS.
* **Time to Test: Surge Day > Normal Range: >20 mIU/ml**
   * The LH surge leads to ovulation within 48 hours.

**Prolactin**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: <24 ng/ml**
   * Increased prolactin levels can interfere with proper ovulation. They may also indicate further testing (MRI) should be done to check for a pituitary tumor. Some women with PCOS also have hyperprolactinemia.

**Progesterone** 

* **Time of Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: <1.5 ng/ml**
   * Progesterone is often called the follicular phase level. An elevated level may indicate a lower pregnancy rate.
* **Time of Test: 7 days past ovulation or Day 21- Normal Range: >15 ng/ml**
   * A progesterone test is done to confirm ovulation. When a follicle releases an egg, it then becomes what is called a corpus luteum and produces progesterone. General results indicate the following:
      * 10+: is normal on a natural cycle.
      * 15+: is normal on a medicated cycle.
      * There is no mid-luteal level that predicts pregnancy.

**Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)**

* **Time of Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 0.4-4 mIU/ml**
   * Mid-range normal in most labs is about 1.7. A high level of TSH combined with a low or normal T4 level generally indicates hypothyroidism, which can affect fertility.

**Free Triiodothyronine (T3)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 1.4-4.4 pg/ml**
   * Sometimes the diseased thyroid gland will start producing very high levels of T3 but still produces normal levels of T4.

**Free Thyroxine (T4)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 0.8-2 ng/dl**
   * A lower level may indicate a thyroid disorder or a non-functioning pituitary gland which is not stimulating the thyroid to produce T4.
   * If the T4 is low and the TSH is normal, this is more likely to indicate a disorder of the pituitary.

**Total Testosterone**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 6-86 ng/dl**
   * Testosterone is an adrenal gland and ovarian hormone. A level >50 is considered to be somewhat elevated and can indicate PCOS.

**Free Testosterone**

* **Time of Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 0.7-3.6 pg/ml**
   * Elevated free Testosterone levels can indicate PCOS.

**Dyhydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 35-430 ug/dl**
   * An elevated DHEAS is often seen in PCOS.
   * Levels improve when working with insulin-sensitizing medications and herbs.

**Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 18-114 nmol/l**
   * Increased androgen production often leads to lower SHBG levels.

**17 Hydroxyprogesterone**

* **Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 20-100 ng/dl**
   * Mid cycle peak would be 100-250 ng/dl, luteal phase 100-500 ng/dl

**Fasting Insulin**

* **Time to Test: 8-16 hours after fasting – Normal Range: <30 mIU/ml**
   * The normal range here is incomplete information. A fasting insulin of 10-13 generally indicates some insulin resistance, with levels above 13 indicating greater insulin resistance.

#### ADVANCED / INVASIVE FERTILITY TESTS

**Sonohysterogram / Saline Ultrasound**

* The sonohysterogram is a procedure in which saline is injected into the uterus while an ultrasound is performed. It is used to look for polyps, fibroids and other uterine abnormalities.

**Endometrial Biopsy**

* **Time of Test: 2nd half of cycle just a few days before menstruation is expected.**
   * An endometrial biopsy is used to “date” the lining of the uterus to see if it is out of sync hormonally.
   * It is considered out of phase if the lining appears to be more than 2 days off.
   * It is common to repeat the biopsy in another cycle, if it is found to be out of phase, before a diagnosis of a luteal phase defect is made.

**Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)**

* **Time of Test: in 1st half of menstrual cycle between days 7-10.**
   * An HSG utilizes dye injected into the uterus to look for anatomic problems, such as tube patency (how open the fallopian tubes are), fibroids, polyps, or structural problems with the uterine cavity.

**Hysteroscopy (HSC)**

* **Time of Test: timing varies.**
   * Alone it may be done at the beginning of a cycle.
   * With a laparoscopy it is usually done around ovulation.
   * With a biopsy it would be performed a few days before the menstrual cycle.
* A hysteroscopy is done under local or general anesthesia. The cervix is dilated in order to insert a tiny scope which the doctor uses for viewing the inside of the uterus. Often carbon dioxide gas is used to expand the uterus for better visualization.
* Minor abnormalities may be fixed during this procedure, and it is sometimes done in conjunction with a laparoscopy, hysterosalpingogram, and/or an endometrial biopsy.

**Laparoscopy (Lap)**

* A laparoscopy is done to look for endometriosis, adhesions and organ malformations. The patient is usually under general anesthesia. Carbon dioxide gas is used to expand the abdominal cavity to provide better visualization.
* The doctor inserts a scope through a small incision inside the navel or just below it to view the outside of the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Often a second incision is made lower in the abdomen through which an instrument is inserted to gently manipulate the organs to allow the scope to examine different angles.
* If found, endometriosis and adhesions may be removed during this surgery.

**Dilation & Curettage**

* A D&C begins with dilating the cervix. An instrument with a vacuum tube attached is inserted and the uterus is both scraped and vacuumed.
* The procedure is often done in conjunction with a hysteroscopy, or to resolve a miscarriage.",t2_7lnyt,False,,0,False,Female fertility hormone levels (serum/blood),[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_gbaouf,False,dark,0.9,,public,28,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,28,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588332555.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Please remove if not allowed.</p>

<h4>FEMALE FERTILITY HORMONE LEVELS (serum/blood)</h4>

<p><strong>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 3-20 mIU/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>FSH is often used as a gauge of ovarian reserve. General results indicate the following:

<ul>
<li>6: considered excellent</li>
<li>6-9: good</li>
<li>10-13: diminished reserve</li>
<li>13+: very hard to stimulate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) testing, the LH: FSH ratio may be used in the diagnosis.</li>
<li>The ratio is usually close to 1:1, but if the LH is higher, it is one possible indication of PCOS.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estradiol (E2)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 25-75 pg/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>Levels on the lower end tend to be better for stimulating.</li>
<li>Abnormally high levels on day 3 may indicate existence of a functional cyst (normal) or Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 4-5 of medication – Range: 100+ pg/ml or 2x Day3</strong>

<ul>
<li>There are no charts showing E2 levels during stimulation since there is a wide variation depending upon how many follicles are being produced as well as their size.</li>
<li>Most doctors will consider any increase in E2 a positive sign, but others use a formula of either 100pg/ml after 4 days of stimulation meds, or a doubling of E2 from the level taken on Day 3 of cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Surge/hCG day – Range: 200+ pg/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>The levels should be 200-600 per mature (18mm) follicle.</li>
<li>These levels are sometimes lower in overweight women.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Luteinizing Hormone (LH)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: &lt;7 mIU/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>A normal LH level is similar to FSH.</li>
<li>An LH that is higher than FSH is one indication of PCOS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Surge Day &gt; Normal Range: &gt;20 mIU/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>The LH surge leads to ovulation within 48 hours.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prolactin</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: &lt;24 ng/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>Increased prolactin levels can interfere with proper ovulation. They may also indicate further testing (MRI) should be done to check for a pituitary tumor. Some women with PCOS also have hyperprolactinemia.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Progesterone</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: &lt;1.5 ng/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>Progesterone is often called the follicular phase level. An elevated level may indicate a lower pregnancy rate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Time of Test: 7 days past ovulation or Day 21- Normal Range: &gt;15 ng/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>A progesterone test is done to confirm ovulation. When a follicle releases an egg, it then becomes what is called a corpus luteum and produces progesterone. General results indicate the following:

<ul>
<li>10+: is normal on a natural cycle.</li>
<li>15+: is normal on a medicated cycle.</li>
<li>There is no mid-luteal level that predicts pregnancy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 0.4-4 mIU/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>Mid-range normal in most labs is about 1.7. A high level of TSH combined with a low or normal T4 level generally indicates hypothyroidism, which can affect fertility.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free Triiodothyronine (T3)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 1.4-4.4 pg/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the diseased thyroid gland will start producing very high levels of T3 but still produces normal levels of T4.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free Thyroxine (T4)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 0.8-2 ng/dl</strong>

<ul>
<li>A lower level may indicate a thyroid disorder or a non-functioning pituitary gland which is not stimulating the thyroid to produce T4.</li>
<li>If the T4 is low and the TSH is normal, this is more likely to indicate a disorder of the pituitary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total Testosterone</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 6-86 ng/dl</strong>

<ul>
<li>Testosterone is an adrenal gland and ovarian hormone. A level &gt;50 is considered to be somewhat elevated and can indicate PCOS.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free Testosterone</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 0.7-3.6 pg/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>Elevated free Testosterone levels can indicate PCOS.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dyhydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 35-430 ug/dl</strong>

<ul>
<li>An elevated DHEAS is often seen in PCOS.</li>
<li>Levels improve when working with insulin-sensitizing medications and herbs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 18-114 nmol/l</strong>

<ul>
<li>Increased androgen production often leads to lower SHBG levels.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>17 Hydroxyprogesterone</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: Day 3 – Normal Range: 20-100 ng/dl</strong>

<ul>
<li>Mid cycle peak would be 100-250 ng/dl, luteal phase 100-500 ng/dl</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fasting Insulin</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to Test: 8-16 hours after fasting – Normal Range: &lt;30 mIU/ml</strong>

<ul>
<li>The normal range here is incomplete information. A fasting insulin of 10-13 generally indicates some insulin resistance, with levels above 13 indicating greater insulin resistance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>ADVANCED / INVASIVE FERTILITY TESTS</h4>

<p><strong>Sonohysterogram / Saline Ultrasound</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The sonohysterogram is a procedure in which saline is injected into the uterus while an ultrasound is performed. It is used to look for polyps, fibroids and other uterine abnormalities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Endometrial Biopsy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Test: 2nd half of cycle just a few days before menstruation is expected.</strong>

<ul>
<li>An endometrial biopsy is used to “date” the lining of the uterus to see if it is out of sync hormonally.</li>
<li>It is considered out of phase if the lining appears to be more than 2 days off.</li>
<li>It is common to repeat the biopsy in another cycle, if it is found to be out of phase, before a diagnosis of a luteal phase defect is made.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Test: in 1st half of menstrual cycle between days 7-10.</strong>

<ul>
<li>An HSG utilizes dye injected into the uterus to look for anatomic problems, such as tube patency (how open the fallopian tubes are), fibroids, polyps, or structural problems with the uterine cavity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hysteroscopy (HSC)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Test: timing varies.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Alone it may be done at the beginning of a cycle.</li>
<li>With a laparoscopy it is usually done around ovulation.</li>
<li>With a biopsy it would be performed a few days before the menstrual cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A hysteroscopy is done under local or general anesthesia. The cervix is dilated in order to insert a tiny scope which the doctor uses for viewing the inside of the uterus. Often carbon dioxide gas is used to expand the uterus for better visualization.</li>
<li>Minor abnormalities may be fixed during this procedure, and it is sometimes done in conjunction with a laparoscopy, hysterosalpingogram, and/or an endometrial biopsy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Laparoscopy (Lap)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A laparoscopy is done to look for endometriosis, adhesions and organ malformations. The patient is usually under general anesthesia. Carbon dioxide gas is used to expand the abdominal cavity to provide better visualization.</li>
<li>The doctor inserts a scope through a small incision inside the navel or just below it to view the outside of the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Often a second incision is made lower in the abdomen through which an instrument is inserted to gently manipulate the organs to allow the scope to examine different angles.</li>
<li>If found, endometriosis and adhesions may be removed during this surgery.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dilation &amp; Curettage</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A D&amp;C begins with dilating the cervix. An instrument with a vacuum tube attached is inserted and the uterus is both scraped and vacuumed.</li>
<li>The procedure is often done in conjunction with a hysteroscopy, or to resolve a miscarriage.</li>

In 2017 I had an ectopic and resulted in removal of the tube. The other tube had severe damage as well but was left in. In 2018 and 2019 I had multiple HSGs as well as a laparoscopy/hysteroscopy - all results were basically “not impossible but highly improbable”. All this due to damage after a ruptured appendix. In December of 2019 I had another ectopic and lost the remaining tube. 

Prior to that we were holding out hope for a miracle since fertility treatment beyond surgical procedures is not covered under our insurance plans, but now that our chances have dropped down to a big fat zero I’ve been looking more into making IVF work. Navigating insurance with a lack of familiarity has been difficult but so far I’ve been doing okay. My one issue that I have not found an answer on has been medication preauthorization, so I’m hoping someone may be able to give me some insight? I did search the sub for similar questions, so either this hasn’t been asked or it’s been asked in a way that was too difficult for me to understand the question was the same - apologies if redundant.

So, my main confusion stems from the fact that under my benefits it states that prescription drugs are covered for diagnosis and treatment of infertility. It then says drugs used in conjunction with ART and assisted insemination procedures are not covered. I’ve gone through my insurance formulary and almost all of the medications on the spreadsheet I found here are covered but require preauthorization. (If it’s relevant/helpful info - my insurance is through BCBS federal employee program). 

Is this basically just a big roundabout way for them to deny coverage for the medications when provided with supplemental medical documentation to justify the prescriptions? Do I actually have a chance for them to be covered? 50/50 shot? I’m trying to get the best grasp on the complete cost of IVF, the sooner I do that the sooner I can start.

We have been trying for the past 2 years with no success.

I've been trying since 2/19. I had a lap/hysteroscopy a few months ago that removed Stage I endo and corrected an arcuate uterus, but I regret this as two other REs I've talked to don't think surgery is worthwhile for these things. No other known issues except a longish cycle. However, I'm not surprised at all to be in this position. I remember naively reading ""What to Expect When You're Trying to Conceive"" right when we started and hearing for the first time to budget a year and that some women still didn't conceive by then, often for no clear reason, and this was called infertility. I still remember feeling sick and saying to my husband, ""I just know this is going to be me.""

I had actually started going to therapy several months before we started trying to help me cope with my disappointment in my stalled career (which I decided to stay in bc I expected to be pregnant shortly; I'll need to start in a whole new field, and I wanted to take time off when my kid(s) are little) and my lifelong feeling that I was powerless and my efforts weren't rewarded with the expected outcomes. Unfortunately, after over a year with that therapist and 3+ months with a new one, my experiences of therapy and infertility have only confirmed this feeling. The kicker is I can't help believing that my mental health is making getting pregnant harder. Ahhh!

I just feel like everything I hear about therapy, from friends, to Reddit posts, to health sites, makes it sound like people walk away from most sessions feeling better, with a new perspective or better coping skills, but even though I've worked hard and connected with both of my therapists, nothing is changing. So I would love to hear from anyone who has had success in therapy around fertility what they learned, what those coping skills are, how to make yourself more open to change, how to let go of resentment of friends who got pregnant easily, or anything else useful that you got from the experience.

I’ve never posted here before, but I can assure you that I have been here a while and this group has seen me through some dark days and made me feel so much less alone. This is my first time posting here so if this is not the right place, I apologize. I tried searching other posts, but couldn’t find anything similar to what I am encountering.

I have UHC as my insurance with a $25k lifetime maximum (located in NJ). Thus far, I have had 3 egg retrievals and 1 failed FET. UHC is insisting that I have roughly $19k remaining before I hit my maximum. Both my clinic and I find this hard to believe, but I’m not sure what else to do if they’re telling me incorrect information multiple times (and in writing).

I’m at the point where I need to go for another retrieval. My clinic is basically presenting this like I will be paying out of pocket. Their perspective is that UHC will eventually realize they’ve overpaid and I will be responsible for payment and they basically don’t want to deal with not getting paid while I potentially battle UHC. My financial coordinator also told me that the insurance providers can pay claims and then years (up to 3) later realize they overpaid and then patients are responsible. 

Has anyone ever encountered this and gone down the road of “believing” the insurance’s likely wrong information? Has it come back to haunt you and did you win the fight against them? I don’t want to set myself or the clinic up for an insurance battle, but I also don’t want to miss out on benefits I pay for. Appreciate any input anyone has to offer.

UPDATE: The clinic reviewed all the support I provided from UHC and did some investigation of their own. They’ve accepted the information UHC provided with the caveat that I’ll be responsible if they deny any claims which is fine with me since insurance gets charged a lower rate than I would out of pocket.

I'm Khaled Kteily, the CEO of Legacy. We are the fatherhood company, helping men and transgender women on their journey to fatherhood.

Male fertility is often overlooked and destigmatized, even though male-factor infertility is responsible for 30-50% of infertility cases in couples. We're working on changing the view that fertility is a ""women's issue"".

Male fertility has declined by 50% in the last 40 years, and infertility affects about 1 in 7 couples. So thinking about male fertility matters for single men, men in heterosexual couples men in same-sex relationships, trans-gender women, cancer patients, men in the military, men in high-risk occupations, and more.

We started out of Harvard's Innovation Labs in early 2018, and have grown significantly since then. We primarily offer from-home sperm testing and sperm cryopreservation via mail-in kits, which is important for cost and accessibility (since not everyone can, or wants to, go visit a local clinic).

In some cities, we also offer a 1-hour courier service from your home to our clinic (New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Austin), which is important to cancer patients and others who want to freeze a fresh sample.

We will be **answering questions throughout today and tomorrow**. Here are some of the team members, although we will be posting it through the official *legacyfertility* account:

* Khaled Kteily (CEO; former healthcare consultant)
* Daniel Madero (Operations; 5 years of experience running a fertility clinic)
* Sarah Steinle (Partnerships; worked in egg freezing at Extend Fertility)
* and others!

Where relevant we will be pulling in our medical advisors to provide additional insight, including Dr. Paul Turek, Dr. Gail Prins, and others.

You can see the website at [https://www.givelegacy.com](https://www.givelegacy.com)

*Update 1:* Our team has seen all of the questions and we're working on getting everyone the best answers we can. We're thrilled with the response here, but please bear with us as we balance this with the rest of our day. It may take us a day or two to get back to you, but we will respond to everyone.

*Update 2:*  We're currently writing answers to as many of the questions we've received. One important update is we have removed Dr. Mariel Arvizu from being mentioned in the post. Due to her affiliation with the Harvard School of Public Health, there are certain restrictions with things like responses on message boards. We apologize for the inconvenience, but are interested in being upfront and transparent. 

*Update 3:* Hi everyone, our team has spent a couple of hours working through answers for as many questions as possible. We've consulted with advisors with specific sections to ensure we're getting the best information to you. A few things we'd like to explicitly state:

1. We understand a for-profit institution working on an AMA here may cause individuals to raise their eyebrows. However, we are sincerely interested in improving the world of male fertility, this is why we've built this company, why we have initiatives like opening our own labs, contributing financially towards fertility studies, and ultimately why we've chosen this subreddit to have this discussion.
2. Many of the questions that individuals have posted require specific and tailored advice. As such, any response we have posted should not be considered medical advice as you are not speaking with a specialist who has your full and personal medical history.
3. Lastly, we understand that we have not answered all of the questions. We will be working to make another pass at these. Although it won't be at the top of a most recent post, please bear with us.

We will have a few more questions answered today. There's been a lot on morphology and we want to make sure our information is as up to date as possible. Be on the lookout for those!

Update 4: We've added a few updates for questions on [morphology](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g967q5/hi_we_are_legacy_the_fatherhood_company_ask_us/fows4y7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), [DNA fragmentation](https://old.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g967q5/hi_we_are_legacy_the_fatherhood_company_ask_us/fp02pvi/), and [IVF practices](https://old.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g967q5/hi_we_are_legacy_the_fatherhood_company_ask_us/fowsbl3/).

<p>We will be <strong>answering questions throughout today and tomorrow</strong>. Here are some of the team members, although we will be posting it through the official <em>legacyfertility</em> account:</p>

<ul>
<li>Khaled Kteily (CEO; former healthcare consultant)</li>
<li>Daniel Madero (Operations; 5 years of experience running a fertility clinic)</li>
<li>Sarah Steinle (Partnerships; worked in egg freezing at Extend Fertility)</li>
<li>and others!</li>
</ul>

<p>Where relevant we will be pulling in our medical advisors to provide additional insight, including Dr. Paul Turek, Dr. Gail Prins, and others.</p>

<p>P.S. We just <a href=""https://medium.com/@khaled_legacy/just-bring-yourself-legacys-new-brand-story-and-vision-97b82895e22c?source=---------3------------------"">launched our new website</a> on Friday. Let us know what you think!</p>

<p>You can see the website at <a href=""https://www.givelegacy.com"">https://www.givelegacy.com</a></p>

<p><em>Update 1:</em> Our team has seen all of the questions and we&#39;re working on getting everyone the best answers we can. We&#39;re thrilled with the response here, but please bear with us as we balance this with the rest of our day. It may take us a day or two to get back to you, but we will respond to everyone.</p>

<p><em>Update 2:</em>  We&#39;re currently writing answers to as many of the questions we&#39;ve received. One important update is we have removed Dr. Mariel Arvizu from being mentioned in the post. Due to her affiliation with the Harvard School of Public Health, there are certain restrictions with things like responses on message boards. We apologize for the inconvenience, but are interested in being upfront and transparent. </p>

<p><em>Update 3:</em> Hi everyone, our team has spent a couple of hours working through answers for as many questions as possible. We&#39;ve consulted with advisors with specific sections to ensure we&#39;re getting the best information to you. A few things we&#39;d like to explicitly state:</p>

<ol>
<li>We understand a for-profit institution working on an AMA here may cause individuals to raise their eyebrows. However, we are sincerely interested in improving the world of male fertility, this is why we&#39;ve built this company, why we have initiatives like opening our own labs, contributing financially towards fertility studies, and ultimately why we&#39;ve chosen this subreddit to have this discussion.</li>
<li>Many of the questions that individuals have posted require specific and tailored advice. As such, any response we have posted should not be considered medical advice as you are not speaking with a specialist who has your full and personal medical history.</li>
<li>Lastly, we understand that we have not answered all of the questions. We will be working to make another pass at these. Although it won&#39;t be at the top of a most recent post, please bear with us.</li>
</ol>

<p>We will have a few more questions answered today. There&#39;s been a lot on morphology and we want to make sure our information is as up to date as possible. Be on the lookout for those!</p>

<p>Update 4: We&#39;ve added a few updates for questions on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g967q5/hi_we_are_legacy_the_fatherhood_company_ask_us/fows4y7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x"">morphology</a>, <a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g967q5/hi_we_are_legacy_the_fatherhood_company_ask_us/fp02pvi/"">DNA fragmentation</a>, and <a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g967q5/hi_we_are_legacy_the_fatherhood_company_ask_us/fowsbl3/"">IVF practices</a>. We are continuing to monitor this and work through responses. Thank you for your patience!</p>

183,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I made a reference to an infertility playlist I created and a few Redditors said they were interested in knowing what's on it. I've been through five rounds of IUI and four IVF egg retrievals. The furthest my husband and I ever got was a chemical pregnancy. My husband and I have decided to give IVF one more go once the COVID restrictions are lifted, but if that cycle doesn't work out we are going to stop treatment and just start building a life without children. This has been a devastating journey and we are no where near where we thought we would be when we started trying for a baby four years ago.

This playlist is something I started working on after my miscarriage. Reinterpreting songs and listening to music has been therapeutic. These songs allow me to grieve what could have been, and put me in a good head space to figure out how to move on. I hope someone finds it helpful and will listen with me. If anyone has any songs they would like to add, I would love to hear them.

Here is the list, along with brief descriptions about why I chose them: 

1. ""Never Enough"" from The Greatest Showman soundtrack | Expresses the pain and frustration of living with a void that can't be filled. 
2. ""Clean"" by Taylor Swift | This song makes me think of the abuse I've put my body through to undergo fertility treatments and even though it will be hard to say goodbye to the baby I never met, I do believe it will be an incredible relief to let it all go.
3. ""Try"" by Mandy Harvey | Promotes self care and reminds me to reach out to others even when I'm hurting
4. ""Slipped Away"" by Avril Lavigne | Allows me to grieve for the baby I lost to miscarriage.
5. ""Call It What You Want"" by Taylor Swift | Celebrates the support I received from my husband through all this, and reminds me to ignore the judgement we receive as a child-free couple.
6. ""Tightrope"" from The Greatest Showman soundtrack | Reminder to embrace the unknown and seize new adventures with my husband. We are summit hikers who love to travel so this song really resonates with me.
7. ""Out From Under"" by Britney Spears | Reminds me how addicting fertility treatments can be, and the struggle of trying to tune out that one little good egg that may exist and won’t stop trying to lure me back in.
8. ""Read all About It"" by Emeli Sande | Rejects shame and makes me want to find and speak out for others who are going through infertility.
9. ""You Need to Calm Down"" by Taylor Swift | Response to all the unsolicited fertility advice and to the people who feel the need to share their opinions about something that doesn't affect them and they know nothing about.
10. ""What Have I Done"" by Dermot Kennedy | The intense connection to an embryo is something that can't be explained and is a bit terrifying. We spend so much time gong through the motions of fertility treatment that emotional connections can be overwhelming when an embryo appears viable or a pregnancy occurs. This song makes me think about how crazy it is that I willfully put myself in such vulnerable situations.
11. ""That Would Be Enough"" from the Hamilton soundtrack | This song has lyrics about pregnancy so it's a little weird, but it's a sweet reminder of what I wanted for my husband and my marriage when we started this journey.
12. ""Say Something"" by A Great Big World and Christina Aguilera | Captures the stumbles we make and the relationship doubt that can be created created while navigating infertility as a couple.
13. ""Don’t Know What It’s Like to Be You"" by Sean Mendez | Upbeat reminder to respect differences in a relationship and remember that we can never fully appreciate what someone else is going through.
14. ""Fix You"" by Coldplay | Good song to listen to when I just want to allow myself to be sad. It's an ode to my broken heart and body.
15. ""Down"" by Jason Walker | Coping with the disappointment and feeling isolated.
16. ""How Far I’ll Go"" from the Moana soundtrack | I don't belong to the tribe of mothers in my family or society. There are other avenues I could take to try to achieve motherhood because it would just make everyone more comfortable, but I am choosing not to.

Infertility

Dealing with husband's infertility1

Today 18:26Bells3032

Sorry just needing to vent and maybe see if there's anyone else in the same boat.

Let me preface this by saying that I love my husband more than anything. what we are going through does not impact how much I love and want to be with him and i know that whatever it takes and whether the result is biological or not it will be worth it to build a family together.

My husband was always honest with me that he had suffered a brain tumour as a child, though kind of downplayed how likely the effects on his fertility will be. First SA in April 2019 showed 10 immobile sperm. He started on Gonasi to try and replace his synthetic testosterone on April 19 and his results were really phenomenal and his natural testoterone kicked in so well she had to reduce his dosage which was brilliant and we tried for SA again in Feb and it was 0.

Never mind I thought. the doctor was clear that might happen as he's still not producing LH and FSH so prescribed that. We picked up his first load yesterday but not planning to start it for a month as 1. very expensive and don't really want to risk earlier pregnancy (I'll explain that later) but 2. if he has a reaction getting medical support will be difficult.

We had originally started thinking about trying for a baby in late 20/early 21 but we just don't know if the drugs are gonna work. We want to start them earlier to see if they work but also don't want to risk getting pregnant til he has passed his probation at his new job in September.

I currently have a coil due to having horrific periods but it expires in August so were thinking about having it out then and letting my hormones settle for a few cycles before this new hormone works.

I have always been positive about this process, guess partly cos i've never been the ""baby fever"" type and the idea of having kids was always so abstract.

But suddenly in lock down all my priorities are changing and starting to think about this and really deal with how hard this will all be. My family are the type that all got pregnant like that and even until recently i just held out hope the drugs will work and we will be able to conceive a child naturally and now realising this may not be as easy as i always dreamed and I am struggling to let go of the dream that I may not be able to conceive in a romantic way.

So instead I am becoming obsessive about looking at hospitals to give birth in or ivf clinics to use or donor and adoption websites just for some level of control. 

It's suddenly all hitting me and i can't talk to anyone as everyone else in my family just thought about it and they were pregnant. Anyone else in the same place?",t2_3ekt5fhp,False,,0,False,Struggling not being able to control anything,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_g8khfo,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Emotional Support,False,0,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1587957403.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>MENU</p>

189,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"First of all, forgive me if you read some of this in this morning's treatment thread. I realized after posting that this is the point where I should introduce myself here and illicit the wealth of experience and knowledge on this sub.

Speaking of which and before I get into my own sad sorry story, this sub is everything!! I'm fairly new here but unfortunately not in the least new to the topic and I've been going insane over the past three years since I've been in active treatment toggling between various b&by d&st nightmare-boards, desperately wishing for a place on the internet exactly like this one. Thank you so much for making it exist <3. 

So now me. Trying for 3.5 years, in treatment for almost 3. We were considered solely MFI (husband has good count but moderate-low motility and low morphology fluctuating from 1-3 percent normal, probably due to his epilepsy medication) But after two failed IUIs and three IVF cycles resulting in no live births as well as me aging up from 34 to 37, the assumption is that my egg quality is likely compromised and so we seem to have gone from MFI to ""multiple factors."" 

After the two failed IUIs, we did a short-protocol antagonist cycle, yielding only one blast that did implant but then turned out to be a chemical. Because I got pregnant, we repeated the protocol but saw uneven development and a lead follicle, leading to only two fair-quality day-3 embryos, neither of which took. We tried one last short protocol but canceled the cycle because of uneven development and then switched to a long-protocol agonist cycle (in between I had a hysteroscopy to remove a cyst) which resulted in a significantly higher egg count and a good amount of embryos but nothing stuck (still have one frozen day-6 blast from that). 

After that I did the EndomeTrio from Igenomix, which not only tests receptivity but also bacterial culture and some measure of toxicity in the uterus. I was receptive but found to have ""ultralow biomass,"" ie not enough lactobacilii in my uterus, which I treated with Gynoflor suppositories (science is a bit fuzzy as to whether it has any effect but go off Igenomix).

Oh we've done the genetic panels and have no issues there, but I have Factor V Leiden, psoriatic arthritis and the MTHFR mutation, so I do blood thinner and prednisone from transfer and take Methylfolate (as well as CoQ10, DHEA and basically every other recommended supplement from It Starts With The Egg, okayed by my RE). I also take a thyroid pill. Oh, and I actually got pregnant accidentally twice when I was much younger and totally unready for motherhood. I miscarried both before I was able to abort, which points further to egg quality issues.

So now I'm starting down-reg on Wednesday with Synarel (I'm in Germany and they prefer that to Lupron here generally) for my fourth cycle. On my Thursday ultrasound my RE thinks she saw around 12 antral follicles, which is fine but lower than what I've had before. My AMH has also dipped in the past year from 2.05 to 1.25. Once my cycle starts I'll begin with daily injections of Pergoveris (150 iu FSH, 75 iu LH), then eventually trigger with Ovidrell for a retrieval around May 20 (my 38th birthday). 

The lovely twist is that in Germany all pre-implantation genetic analysis is banned, largely due to holdover anxiety about the Nazi eugenics programs. There are other weird rules, like you can only culture 5 embryos at a time, so if you get more than that you have to freeze them on day one (half of my fertilized long-protocol eggs were frozen as zygotes, then thawed and cultured). Anyway, that means I have no idea about aneuploidy or whether we have even made any chromosomally normal embryos. 

The good part about living here though is that almost everything so far has been covered by insurance, but that runs out after this last round, plus I honestly feel like I can't go on with this if this round fails. But NO PRESSURE, right? lol fml. 

Anyway, I guess in the spirit of leaving no stone unturned, I just wanted to put this all up here in case any of you might have insights due to overlapping experiences or see anything I've missed or maybe just to say hi.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

We’ve got issues on both sides including mild male factor, persistent ovarian cyst (yes, just one), supplemental synthroid due to highish TSH. 
Biggest issue I’m having is with this cyst. It is about 2.5cm on my right ovarian and it’s been there since at least sept 2019- that’s when I had my first transvaginal ultrasound. RE says it could have potentially been there for years, we honestly don’t know. Anyways- we tried waiting it out, then birth control pills, then we proceeded anyways with 3 IUIs (all unsuccessful). 
So we are at the point to move to IVF, but I’m wondering if the cyst was partially to blame for the failures and if surgically removal before ivf would be beneficial. Before the iuis I had a choice to have it surgically removed, but my RE didn’t make it seem necessary, therefore I chose to forego. 
As I know everyone is kind of at a crossroads due to the Covid and whatnot I just want a solid plan in place before moving forward and my mind has been spinning with all this extra time. 
Anyone have any experiences, comments, opinions, advice about any of this??? Anything is appreciated! Thanks

I am male, late 20's, pretty healthy.

Am considering finasteride/Propecia for male pattern hair loss. Infertility is listed as a possible side effect. Spoke with several doctors including a urologist who didn't seem super concerned. I have a biology background and read studies that seem to indicate that in most cases fertility won't be an issue, some case studies show DNA fragmentation/other parameters reduced, usually reversing after discontinuing the drug. I don't have children and have never tried to. Would almost certainly like to have children in the future and obviously want healthy children.

Does anyone have experience with the drug?

<p>Am considering finasteride/Propecia for male pattern hair loss. Infertility is listed as a possible side effect. Spoke with several doctors including a urologist who didn&#39;t seem super concerned. I have a biology background and read studies that seem to indicate that in most cases fertility won&#39;t be an issue, some case studies show DNA fragmentation/other parameters reduced, usually reversing after discontinuing the drug. I don&#39;t have children and have never tried to. Would almost certainly like to have children in the future and obviously want healthy children.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with the drug?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I am considering sperm banking, I have excellent insurance and am trying to figure out if it is covered under the new laws in NYS. If I pay out of pocket it is not cheap, but nowhere near as expensive as IVF and such ( ironically IVF would be covered up to 3 cycles). Any experience getting this covered or how much to bank?</p>

I (21F) and my husband (24M) have been trying for almost 2 years now which is depressing to say the least.  We got married April of 2018 and we are happily married. This is just getting this off my chest and maybe help someone else who is just starting there journey. I've never had regular period in my life ever. My natural periods are heavy and painful (a 9/10 or higher). Its a nightmare and they can last up to 7 or 8 days. This happened inconsistently when I was young. i started at almost 13years old. When I was 17 I brought up to my mom I was never consistent and on my yearly check up with my pediatrician they had me get test. I had blood work and an ultrasound done. From what I remember I had elevated testerone (only thing mentioned) but no cyst or  anything on my ultrasound. Everything looked good. My pediatrician had suspected pcos but basically she said I should get on Birth control. My shit storm of a father refused and said it would encourage me to have sex blah blah blah. it was stupid and I tried to convince him I'm not only i need this per doctors recommendation. Nope nothing. I've always wanted a family and I knew my period issues would cause a problem. it was apparent to me and this made it worse as it was the only thing I initially knew would help. 


Fast forward a year and me and hubby had started dating. At 1st we used condoms and I did get my period the 1st 3 months we were together. we stopped a few months into it. I went to see a doctor same pediatrician and started Birth control (Sprintec?). Took 3 months for a painful period to Kick in but August of 2017 I started taking it monthly.  We were even younger than we are now and at the times we werent ready for kids. We get engaged Oct 2017 and married April 2018.  This whole time we talk of kids and a family but that stuff didn't get real until after we were married. My hubby noticed I watched a lot of videos about pregnancy and announcements and just the whole process and he asked me in June 2018 how serious I was about kids. I explained how I wanted them and I've always wanted a big family (possible 5 kids). He sees the spark in my eyes I guess and he agrees we can start trying. so July of that year I had my final period on birth control and quit a terrible stressful job at the same time. I do some basic research. Buy a digital ovulation kit (clearblue) and we have set everywhere day for a month. I was aware it could take awhile for period to come back so 1st month off no period. 2nd month off nothing. Both months negative test. I go back to work August of 2018. no positive ovulation or pregnancy test. I cried a lot. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. Something is wrong as by Oct i still don't have a period. 


I see an obgyn. tell her whats up. Now since I've been with hubby I've gained a lot of weight. I went from 120 ish to by this time 185-190 lbs in a year and a half. rapid. And especially since I stopped working mt old fast food job wasn't on my feet 6 to 10 hours a day so I wasn't active. stayed at about 150lbs-160lbs working at my fast food place (I had been working there for a year and a half. I ate there but not much. was picky about food but stress and long hours standing, walking, running and moving kept me low). She informs me that I need to lose weight, stop eating a lot of sugar and soda and go back on birth control for at least like 6 months. I was very upset by this I cried. I didn't want to take birth control. Although she was right about my weight I didn't think it would solve my proves. she suggested I had pcos but never confimed and mostly said kept insulin in check by eating better and the weight will fall off. I hated her as she never addressed my long term struggle with peeiod which were like that for years when I was skinny (ive been very skinny as a child always). She did induce my peeiod with progestrone (prometirum I think was the name brand) and I had a heavy period. I got blood test but nothing stood out. I had the test dont before my period I didn't know it made a different at the time. 

Anyways I cut back eating sugars some mostly with candy ans I tried to cut out soda/juice but soon my husband lost his job in Nov 2018 and we fell on hard times for a few months. and we leave our 1st married apartment ( got in April 2018). we had a week where we stayed at family as it wasn't a smooth house transition. At that time I found an RE (if you don't know reproductive endocrinologist). I found out what they were and what they do and how they would be able to directly help me. I excitedly told my husband and we made plans to go see one and I saved up money along with an HSA card. 

April 2019 I seen the RE who we will call Dr. C. An amazing doctor. Again I got blood work. I had very low vitamin D my testerone was not a problem that was noted. I think I had some slightly elevated estrogen. He went over my systems and I at this point had an idea of what was going on, PCOS, and knew some of what I needed. i hadn't had a peeiod since my induced one back in Oct/Nov 2018. it had been a few months Dr. C noticed my larger weight gain which I was over 210lbs by the time I had seen him. He noted all my problem and gave me an ultrasound. He stated I did have pcos. Hubby evebt for test with his perm and everythinf came back almost period (he was a bit on the thick side but lots of swimmers) He recommended I did lose the weight. Gave me a prescription for vitamin D 50,000iui as mines was so incredibly low it was crazy. I took that for 8 weeks and then too regular supplements. I started prenatal and he got me on progeatrone (I told him I didn't want BC and he totally understood so this was my next option 1 pill for 10 days on the 1st 10 days of the month. 1 month took it nothing happened. Dr. C did inform me I may or may not get one and I could get pregnant. He also offered to start treatment of letrozole whenever I was ready although he did recommend losing weight to lower my risk I was still able to get treatment. 

That month (June 2019) other family stuff came up so we couldn't start to my disappointment. But July 2018 I got my first period in over 200 days. it was short and spotty but something. August 2018 I joined group on Facebook and started with cheaper ovulation test and started bbt. Nothing happened and treatment was expensive so I ended up not getting treatment and tried to lose weight. I was on Ovasitol from June till Oct 2019 but that wasn't working and was expensive. I asked for metformin which is the medicine for pcos and diabetes. Welp that helped much more.

 Dec 2019-Mar 2020 I went from recorded weight previously 215 till 204 and stayed there till recently (I'm back at about 208 due to covid-19. stress, stress eating and food shortages of my normal stuff). Well good news I finally had the money for my 1st treatment. timed Intercourse with letrozole. I started my pweiod Feb 14. started treatment 2 days after. it almost was perfect but we were short money. I needed a 3rd monitoring ultrasound. I couldn't take the specific triggering shot which would for sure induce my eggs to release. I was on 2.5 mg of letrozole and I got 2 eggs that began to mature on one side only. 

I ended up not pregnant even with some signs like sex feeling different which was a 1st for me. that crushed me and hubby and the cost being 340 per office visit with ultrasound was a lot. so we ended up taking a break. mostly for him and our finances. he was emotionally drained and needed a break and I was crushed that the money we needed wouldn't be here till next year. I felt betrayed and like nothing I did mattered. I tried so hard and just nothing was enough. Betrayed by God and everything. 

Then covid 19 happened and tax returns came back and now we have saved half our return in order to go get treatments for another cycle. after I meet my deductible this next cycle out of pocket cost will be 15%. if it doesn't work we can try another round of letrozole or even do iui. Even with covid 19 we plan on trying in May again as my trigger shot is only good for 6 months (still in my fridge) which would be July of this year. This is like the best I can say for me.

 I'm excited to try again. I really want to be a mom and I want to be pregnant. I'm hoping for the best. If anyone wants more details about how my timed intercourse went or my weight struggles or what pcos is like or what medicines I have and haven't taken you can ask away. idk if anyone will read this but if so good luck and try not to give up.

Finally went with donor egg and have one embryo that I need to stick. I have a semi normal cycle, not painful, off by a few days here and there. I ovulate and my endometrial lining is pretty good. We are going for a modified natural cycle I suppose.  

&#x200B;

A few months ago I read about Progesterone in Oil shots and brought this up to my doctor and at the time she insisted they were barbaric so I just took her advice and went through with the ERA using her suggested way for meds.

&#x200B;

ERA: Did ERA with Ovidrel Trigger shot followed by 2 times a day vaginally Endometrin & Estrace taken orally in the morning and nightly inserted vaginally.

At the same time I did ERA I did an endometrial biopsy. This came back positive. I was immediately put on Orilissa while waiting for HSG and CA-125 test results. The HSG showed I didn’t have blocked tubes but I did have like a tissue growth, which she is now calling Adenomyosis. We are waiting to get a hysteroscopy to remove and biopsy to make sure. The CA-125 came back normal so I was taken off the Orilissa. 

&#x200B;

I did a consult with my doctor last week and I mention that I had found actual studies that vaginal progesterone was inferior to PIO done daily or every 3 days with vaginal inserts. \[Study found here\]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29338855/?dopt=Abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29338855/?dopt=Abstract))

&#x200B;

She said “You can use PIO if you want but its normally used with a medicated cycle and you can use one or the other but not both”. This now has me in a whirlwind because as stated above the PIO in the study was better than just vaginal inserts. I don’t mind the pain if it helps more, also I don’t know if I’ll have to redo the ERA with the PIO, if I choose it. 

&#x200B;

I have another consult on Monday before my hysteroscopy to work out the timeline. Doctor says that the hysteroscopy works as a scratch so I’m assuming the transfer will be soon. So I need to sort this out and any suggestions on what to do would be helpful.

34. Married. No children. I have one sister that's 4 years older, with 2 healthy children. I had my first miscarriage in November 2019 when I started bleeding out at about 6 weeks. I found out I was pregnant again in February and had a silent miscarriage at about 6 weeks and 2 days. Due to Covid-19 I couldn't have a D&C and took Mistoprostol to bleed out. Went through 2 weeks of physical and ongoing emotional pain as many of you probably have. For a few days I was convinced that I couldn't bring myself to try for a baby any longer and that I wasn't strong enough to go through something like that again. This was surprising for me because I've had a roller coaster of a life and have gotten through so much (won't go into details.)

My Dr. had me do complete blood work 7 days ago (17 vials of blood.) I was drained but hungry for answers. Of the tests, 8 have come back normal, 1 has not. I tested positive for 2 copies of the MTHFR C667T mutation. Haven't spoken to my Dr. yet as he said he'd call me once all of the blood work arrives. 

I've googled and read through the different studies and tests that have been done. One study resulted in no correlation between the mutation and recurrent miscarriages. A different study shows a correlation. I'm worried. I want and need facts at this point to keep sane. I'm not only worried about being able to carry to full term if my Dr. prescribes Folate, injections, etc., I'm also worried about the possible Neural Tube defects as well as the possibility of Spiina Bifida. I've tried to look for a percentage of these defects resulting from the mutation and haven't been able to find anything. I feel like if I had these factual percentages, my husband and I would be able to come to a resolution and a decision of what to do with our lives. Do we try again? What's the likelihood of a recurrent miscarriage? What's the likelihood of a defect? I don't want to spend a large chunk of our marriage trying for a baby  with so much uncertainty although I love children. I want a peaceful path for us. I want to have a direction to go by and I know that have the percentages will help us decide what to do.   


At this point, it's a waiting game till we hear back from my Dr. But, I'm hoping that someone here may have some similarities/answers/stories for us.

First IUI was 14 days ago, 36 hours after and HCG trigger. I had confirmed at the time of the IUI I had not yet ovulated, but was told it should be ""soon"". It seems most people ovulate within 48 hours, but I can't find a specific study to that effect. 

Based on that and other signs, I ovulated either that day (thursday), or the next day (friday). Which means today is either 13 or 14dpo. (14dpo if I follow the ovulation within 48 hour rule). 

I had 4 follicles that could have possibly ovulated, and am not on any progesterone support. 

&#x200B;

But in all my years of tracking I have never had a 14+ day luteal phase. I've had negative tests so it's highly unlikely I am pregnant unless I am off in my ovulation date. 

&#x200B;

Question to the sub though, what was your experience like with a stimulated cycle and no progesterone? was your luteal phase the same length as usual? longer?
