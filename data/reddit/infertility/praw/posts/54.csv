My partner and I have been trying naturally and unsuccessfully for over 2 years to conceive. I'm 28, he's 27. 

We now know through many annoying, sometimes painful tests what the issue is: my partner's sperm count is too low. At first it was only 2 million but because of fertilaid   vitamins, it's gone up to 6 million. 

We recently seen a doctor at a fertility clinic in Toronto in the hopes of getting onto the government funded IVF list. 

He told us that everything seems to almost he in order for us to get on the wait list EXCEPT that I had ticked off that I sometimes, very rarely, get painless ocular migraines. Essentially, sometimes, I'd see in one eye a sparkle that only got bigger and bigger until it obscured my vision and the only way to rid of it was to be in complete darkness or take an Ibuprofen. 

I had this all checked out years ago with a CAT scan and an eye doctor and everything appeared normal. 

I didn't even think it would be a big issue pertaining to my fertility. But the Doctor told us that, as one of our final steps, I'd have to see a neurologist to make absolute sure that I could take hormones. Apparently,  aura migraine sufferers COULD be at risk if they take hormones. 

Not only is this incredibly frustrating (who knows how long I'll have to wait to see the neurologist or what their tests will be), but there's a possibility that hormones may not be an option for me, which would kill my chance for both IVF AND IUI. 

I am fairly upset by both the wait and the possibility that my dreams of having my partner's baby could be dashed. 

I see my doctor for a referral request in a little over a week. 

In some way, I am upset that I had checked off the migraine issue. It hasn't come around in awhile now and when it does, it's rare. In another way, I don't want to die or suffer from treatment.

63,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello to you lovely people here. I have been lurking for months and today I am breaking a bit and I need some support from people that know this pain.  This is going to be long so please forgive the wall of text. My husband and I have been trying for 2 years (not sure on the exact amount of time because at the start we had no clue what it takes to get pregnant) We were having fun at first. I started worrying in about August of 2016 when were were not pregnant. October 2016 I downloaded the Fertility Friend app and bought a basal body thermometer and a large box of ovulation test strips on amazon. I read everything on the trying for a baby subreddit and got excited to really try. I forgot about the months before that and counted October as our cycle 1 (I was in denial). Well I quickly figured out I had a horribly short luteal phase of 7 days. I was able to increase it with added B complex to 9 days. I saw my doctor in January of 2017 and showed him my charts and he forwarded me to the fertility clinic in our city. April we met with the RE for the first time and she made us hopeful. We tried luteal phase support with progesterone and when that didn't work we had a failed IUI last month. I am feeling very upset and grieving while my husband does not understand how I feel. He thinks that my mood swings and behaviour is unwarranted and that we should just keep trying. He is positive when I want him to say that he hurts just as much as me. 

Here is the reason for my post tonight seeking some help and support. I have a SIL that at first I got along with quite well. She slowly started making general rude comments about different things and I slowly started to notice that when I spent time with her I would leave feeling bad about myself or drained. I have tried to keep my contact to a minimum because of that. She got pregnant in August 2016 and gave birth May of 2017. In December of 2017 I had a talk  to her about my concerns and explained to her my worries. I wish I could go back and never have talked to her about this. Ever since that conversation she has changed with me. She rubbed her pregnancy in any moment that she could with me. I would text her about our MIL and ask something totally unrelated and she would rub her pregnancy in my face. Another example I was picking her up later in the evening because she doesn‚Äôt drive and I said ‚ÄúHey, I just got home. I am going to bring the dog for a run and I will text you when I am on the way‚Äù her actual response was ‚ÄúMe too, but it is super hard running when you are 9 months pregnant‚Äù, I just shook my head. It made zero sense for her to keep bringing up the pregnancy when it was not the topic of discussion. I have been around a lot of pregnant people at work and they rarely were talking about the pregnancy. With her it was constant. She constantly bragged and completely made me feel like a complete pile of shit failure. Why wasn't my body doing its job?  She asked me in January of 2017 to throw her shower and as painful as it was to say yes I jumped in. She then mentioned that she was planning it for my birthday (2 months before her due date) and I said that it was not cool with me and that I would like for her to choose a different weekend because I was hoping to go away that weekend, you know, my birthday and all. Nope, she wouldn‚Äôt budge, I had to throw it that weekend. I got my period the day before her shower and had to spend my birthday listening to her joy and elation and her constantly asking me to touch her belly. Before IF I would not be touching anyone's belly because it is so personal but she was grabbing my arm and making me. I also found out from a mutual friend that she was shit talking me saying things like ‚ÄúIf she stopped stressing she would get pregnant‚Äù ‚Äú she is trying too hard‚Äù ‚Äúshe is taking this a bit too seriously‚Äù. She said those things when she knew we had met with the RE already.

Ever since she has had her son she has been saying one specific thing that is utterly ridiculous. She has only said in front of our mutual friends that unaware of our struggle. She has said loudly at parties 3-4 times that she cannot have more kids, the doctor told her she couldn't so she will have to have that weird only child (her words). I couldn't help but think that she was doing this to mock my pain. She knows our secret and she is holding her 6 month old saying she cannot have children. Why would she say this? What does this accomplish? 

She had an ectopic pregnancy and had one tube removed before having her son and when this happened I was there for her, I let her cry, vent, I was devastated for her I listened while she complained about her best friend getting pregnant before her. She said that she didn‚Äôt even want to talk to her. I understood and helped in any way possible during this hard time. This of course was short lived because she got pregnant her first try after the ectopic. She has boldly said to me that the ectopic doesn‚Äôt matter to her anymore because she has her baby. It doesn‚Äôt hurt her anymore. That makes me cringe, ofcourse to me these seems like a very painful thing that  you would not easily forget.  

I finally called her out when no one else was around I said ‚ÄúWhy do you keep saying that you cannot have more children?‚Äù Her response to me was that her family doctor told her that she would have a hard time because of her one tube and that she might have a cyst. The doctor told her this the month before she got pregnant. So she was loudly telling people the doctor said she cannot have any more kids when she wasn‚Äôt telling the whole story. Please, hopefully someone can shed some light into why someone would do this or say these things. She also said to me when I told her our next step was IUI ‚ÄúOh yea? Well I am going to have to do IUI for us to get pregnant for a second‚Äù. Again, thanks for mocking my pain and not caring at all about what we are going through. It was when she made that comment that I actually started to believe that she was enjoying watching us struggle. 

My MIL has been in the hospital since the first week of January. She had had some serious complications and when we visit we try and keep things light. On one of those visits my MIL dropped the bomb on us that BIL and SIL are trying again (their son is 9 months old at this time). My MIL was upset about it. She thinks it‚Äôs extremely rushed and that they should wait until their son is older. This announcement seemed to upset my MIL a lot. When I heard this news we had just had our IUI days beforehand. Obviously this upset me. My hormones were a mess and I did not handle it well, it made me not want to be around them even more. My BIL (husbands brother) has been working part time hours since September and my SIL has been getting maternity leave (We live in Canada). I was wondering how they were making ends meet because they have overextended their lifestyles. My husband found out during the following days that my MIL has been supporting them financially for years but more so since September. She cried and told my husband that they are taking advantage of her and she is so stressed about it which is why she cannot understand why they would even be trying again.  She cannot afford to support them now and they are thinking about bringing another child into this world. 

My husband in passing mentioned that my SIL had a doctors appointment today and I said ‚Äúlovely I bet she is already pregnant after 1 month of trying‚Äù.

I have been lurking for months and today I am breaking a bit and I need some support from people that know this pain.  This is going to be long so please forgive the wall of text. My husband and I have been trying for 2 years (not sure on the exact amount of time because at the start we had no clue what it takes to get pregnant) We were having fun at first. I started worrying in about August of 2016 when were were not pregnant. October 2016 I downloaded the Fertility Friend app and bought a basal body thermometer and a large box of ovulation test strips on amazon. I read everything on the trying for a baby subreddit and got excited to really try. I forgot about the months before that and counted October as our cycle 1 (I was in denial). Well I quickly figured out I had a horribly short luteal phase of 7 days. I was able to increase it with added B complex to 9 days. I saw my doctor in January of 2017 and showed him my charts and he forwarded me to the fertility clinic in our city. April we met with the RE for the first time and she made us hopeful. We tried luteal phase support with progesterone and when that didn&#39;t work we had a failed IUI last month. I am feeling very upset and grieving while my husband does not understand how I feel. He thinks that my mood swings and behaviour is unwarranted and that we should just keep trying. He is positive when I want him to say that he hurts just as much as me. </p>

<p>Here is the reason for my post tonight seeking some help and support. I have a SIL that at first I got along with quite well. She slowly started making general rude comments about different things and I slowly started to notice that when I spent time with her I would leave feeling bad about myself or drained. I have tried to keep my contact to a minimum because of that. She got pregnant in August 2016 and gave birth May of 2017. In December of 2017 I had a talk  to her about my concerns and explained to her my worries. I wish I could go back and never have talked to her about this. Ever since that conversation she has changed with me. She rubbed her pregnancy in any moment that she could with me. I would text her about our MIL and ask something totally unrelated and she would rub her pregnancy in my face. Another example I was picking her up later in the evening because she doesn‚Äôt drive and I said ‚ÄúHey, I just got home. I am going to bring the dog for a run and I will text you when I am on the way‚Äù her actual response was ‚ÄúMe too, but it is super hard running when you are 9 months pregnant‚Äù, I just shook my head. It made zero sense for her to keep bringing up the pregnancy when it was not the topic of discussion. I have been around a lot of pregnant people at work and they rarely were talking about the pregnancy. With her it was constant. She constantly bragged and completely made me feel like a complete pile of shit failure. Why wasn&#39;t my body doing its job?  She asked me in January of 2017 to throw her shower and as painful as it was to say yes I jumped in. She then mentioned that she was planning it for my birthday (2 months before her due date) and I said that it was not cool with me and that I would like for her to choose a different weekend because I was hoping to go away that weekend, you know, my birthday and all. Nope, she wouldn‚Äôt budge, I had to throw it that weekend. I got my period the day before her shower and had to spend my birthday listening to her joy and elation and her constantly asking me to touch her belly. Before IF I would not be touching anyone&#39;s belly because it is so personal but she was grabbing my arm and making me. I also found out from a mutual friend that she was shit talking me saying things like ‚ÄúIf she stopped stressing she would get pregnant‚Äù ‚Äú she is trying too hard‚Äù ‚Äúshe is taking this a bit too seriously‚Äù. She said those things when she knew we had met with the RE already.</p>

<p>Ever since she has had her son she has been saying one specific thing that is utterly ridiculous. She has only said in front of our mutual friends that unaware of our struggle. She has said loudly at parties 3-4 times that she cannot have more kids, the doctor told her she couldn&#39;t so she will have to have that weird only child (her words). I couldn&#39;t help but think that she was doing this to mock my pain. She knows our secret and she is holding her 6 month old saying she cannot have children. Why would she say this? What does this accomplish? </p>

<p>She had an ectopic pregnancy and had one tube removed before having her son and when this happened I was there for her, I let her cry, vent, I was devastated for her I listened while she complained about her best friend getting pregnant before her. She said that she didn‚Äôt even want to talk to her. I understood and helped in any way possible during this hard time. This of course was short lived because she got pregnant her first try after the ectopic. She has boldly said to me that the ectopic doesn‚Äôt matter to her anymore because she has her baby. It doesn‚Äôt hurt her anymore. That makes me cringe, ofcourse to me these seems like a very painful thing that  you would not easily forget.  </p>

<p>I finally called her out when no one else was around I said ‚ÄúWhy do you keep saying that you cannot have more children?‚Äù Her response to me was that her family doctor told her that she would have a hard time because of her one tube and that she might have a cyst. The doctor told her this the month before she got pregnant. So she was loudly telling people the doctor said she cannot have any more kids when she wasn‚Äôt telling the whole story. Please, hopefully someone can shed some light into why someone would do this or say these things. She also said to me when I told her our next step was IUI ‚ÄúOh yea? Well I am going to have to do IUI for us to get pregnant for a second‚Äù. Again, thanks for mocking my pain and not caring at all about what we are going through. It was when she made that comment that I actually started to believe that she was enjoying watching us struggle. </p>

<p>My MIL has been in the hospital since the first week of January. She had had some serious complications and when we visit we try and keep things light. On one of those visits my MIL dropped the bomb on us that BIL and SIL are trying again (their son is 9 months old at this time). My MIL was upset about it. She thinks it‚Äôs extremely rushed and that they should wait until their son is older. This announcement seemed to upset my MIL a lot. When I heard this news we had just had our IUI days beforehand. Obviously this upset me. My hormones were a mess and I did not handle it well, it made me not want to be around them even more. My BIL (husbands brother) has been working part time hours since September and my SIL has been getting maternity leave (We live in Canada). I was wondering how they were making ends meet because they have overextended their lifestyles. My husband found out during the following days that my MIL has been supporting them financially for years but more so since September. She cried and told my husband that they are taking advantage of her and she is so stressed about it which is why she cannot understand why they would even be trying again.  She cannot afford to support them now and they are thinking about bringing another child into this world. </p>

<p>My husband in passing mentioned that my SIL had a doctors appointment today and I said ‚Äúlovely I bet she is already pregnant after 1 month of trying‚Äù. Seems like she is because my BIL was saying to my husband that they thought that they were pregnant. When I heard this the beast inside of me woke up. I am so angry. I am feeling so annoyed that my body is not doing its job. I am feeling upset that I am going to have to endure more painful comments at my expense. Our next step is IVF and cannot help but cry at the idea that I am going to have to endure our IVF cycle in May and she will be gloating about her miraculous miracle second child. I cannot be around her anymore. I feel so done with her. I don‚Äôt know what to do or if I am being a total bitch for feeling this way.</p>

<p>If you have made it to the end thank you for listening to me and taking the time to hear me out. I would love to hear any advice as to what I can do about her or my hate for her going forward. This is hurting my mental health having her in my life. I cannot handle much more of her mean, cruel and insensitive comments. I‚Äôm tired of her making me feel like a complete failure.</p>

My husband and i have been battling the dreaded azoospermia diagnosis for the past year. All of his hormones are normal with the exception of testosterone, which was exceptionally low.

So we scrapped that uro and found a specialist out of state. In lieu of a biopsy (which he doesn‚Äôt recommend), he suggested that my husband undergo an anti-sperm antibodies blood test to either confirm or rule out an obstruction. This was the first time we had ever of this test. 

Has anyone had this test done? Or had their male partner perform this test? We had the test done at Quest Diagnostics last week and still waiting for results.

<p>My husband and i have been battling the dreaded azoospermia diagnosis for the past year. All of his hormones are normal with the exception of testosterone, which was exceptionally low. We tried clomid and arimidex for 6 months to no avail. Our uro at the time suggested a biopsy for the next step, but wanted to charge us the same amount for the biopsy as a TESE. So we scrapped that uro and found a specialist out of state. In lieu of a biopsy (which he doesn‚Äôt recommend), he suggested that my husband undergo an anti-sperm antibodies blood test to either confirm or rule out an obstruction. This was the first time we had ever of this test. </p>

<p>Has anyone had this test done? Or had their male partner perform this test? We had the test done at Quest Diagnostics last week and still waiting for results. We have no idea what to expect from the report. Obviously, we are hoping that it confirms an obstruction (and lots of sperm exist). Any experience is welcomed. </p>

Some may remember that my clinic is closing at the end of this month and that I need to choose another one ASAP or I will be waiting months before I can do another transfer. 

My 2 previous FETs done included antibiotics, SIS, baby aspirin, Crinone and Estrace. Lining has been great (over 10mm both times) and progesterone levels have been fine. First FET was a stressful affair and I had pretty serious cramping from day one and it ended in a CP, second transfer was a zen calm experience, no cramping at all and no implantation. Both were PGS normal, 4AA graded and assisted hatching was used. 

Only diagnosis thus far is MFI, but RE suspects endo and the REs all vary on opinion about PCOS. It‚Äôs looking more and more like I have a ‚Äúsoil‚Äù issue to deal with and I should do the ‚Äúkitchen sink‚Äù approach. I have 3 PGS normal embryos left and we will not be doing another ER. 

My mom‚Äôs side of the family has a history of RPL, thyroid issues, fibroids and dad‚Äôs side has a lot of PCOS and possible infertility. 

I have 2 options for clinics.

1. Local PCRM clinic in Edmonton. It‚Äôs a fancy new clinic that is a branch of a long running clinic from Vancouver. A lot of people used this clinic remotely rather than waiting to get into the public funded clinic and I have a friend who is an OBGYN who has recommended them in the past. The clinic does not believe in the ERA test or do intralipids. They will do an endometrial scratch. 

2. Regional Fertility Clinic that is a 4hr drive away in Calgary. Has a RPL clinic that deals with other non fertility clinic patients who are dealing with those issues. They will do ERA, intralipids and scratches. 

I would much prefer to just drive 20 minutes to the local clinic and not have the added stress of travelling but obviously want to choose the right clinic for me. I may be able to push my current clinic to run some RPL blood tests but that may be hard to do since I have only had one loss.

Thoughts? Advice from anyone who has used either of those clinics?

Thanks!

A year before I was born, my mom and dad had a boy who had cleft lip and heart issues. I have never known more than that, mostly because my mom left and has made the choice never to have anything to do with us or her own family. 

It is because of the years of lacking contact with her family that it took me and my husband so long to figure out why we can't seem to have kids. 5 miscarriages changes a person, I tell ya. 

Anyway, we have since been forming a great strong bond with mom's family, and it has been wonderful. Now here's the meat and potatoes of the story. 

A cousin I just recently met from that side shared an old post of hers on Facebook. It was about laying her baby to rest 3 years ago. The baby was born with all the same problems my brother had, and he was diagnosed with Trisomy 13.

I did a lot of research. A lot. The hubs and I have never been given for sure answers on our miscarriages as so far nothing has been found to be wrong with either of us. The only thing left to test is our genetics, and doctors have told us that abnormal chromosomes is most likely the reason. We are starting to think this has been the problem all along. 

Now, I am debating telling said cousin about my brother having the same condition as her son, as well as our miscarriage history. Two others on that side of my family have also lost babies, and this seems a likely cause. I read somewhere that about half of trisomy 13 babies are lost via miscarriage. That makes sense for us. 

For the last part, we have come to the decision that since we will most likely require help conceiving a biological baby that is healthy, we are choosing to adopt in a few years. We both feel great about this, as we will no longer have any losses. Thank you for letting me rant.

Despite lurking around in r/infertility for the  past few months, this is my first post. I‚Äôve really appreciated the advice so far. 

My rant: I just got some test results back. AMH was 0.9 (I‚Äôm 32). All other results so far are normal (my prolactin levels are 23, so according to my clinic‚Äôs range it scrapes in as normal, but high). I‚Äôm still waiting to get day3 tests and AFC done, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll actually be diagnosed with DOR, but it certainly looks that way. 

I normally live in the states, but am currently stuck half a world away due to some minor (but time consuming) visa issues. I think it‚Äôs making me particularly stressed because my husband is back in the US, and getting the news alone really made my head spin - and probably worse because I couldn‚Äôt hug him. I also can‚Äôt see my doctor for further testing right now - more stress, and also why I‚Äôm reaching out. This brings me to my question. 

My question: Now that I‚Äôm looking like I may have a DOR diagnosis I‚Äôm wondering if my current clinic is the best one for us. We haven‚Äôt started IVF yet, but just about to finish up with the final tests before getting started. We initially went to our current clinic because it‚Äôs geographically convenient and because they advertise a very cheap IVF package (something like $6500 plus meds and the rest). Their success rates are OK, probably not great though, and I‚Äôm not sure how experienced they are with DOR. We are paying out of pocket. My initial concern was running out of money, but now I‚Äôm worried about running out of time. So I wanted to ask your thoughts about potentially paying more for a clinic that has a lot of experience with DOR? Do you think it makes A LOT or difference? I‚Äôm kind of assuming a better clinic = fewer cycles, but that might be really naive. What would you do? I‚Äôm located in the northeast so if anyone had any specific recommendations about clinics that deal well with DOR in the tristate, I‚Äôd love to hear.

Close 2 years working on this. 3 failed IUIs, our 4th is scheduled for 8am on Valentine's Day (how romantic)  And I seriously lost my shit this morning!

 Short background: I have a long history of depression, and I am treated for it (therapist, psych., meds, the works.) Took me so many years to be even remotely comfortable with the idea of having a medicated pregnancy,  that this infertility has just knocked me on my ass. 

Also super sensitive to sleep. Need 9, only got 6 yesterday, and I swear I woke up feeling like a wild animal. Just insane. Racing, slamming shit around,  arguing with husband. I even got of my car and assaulted a taxi who cut me off and then illegally parked blocking my entrance to RE parking garage. Honking didn't work, so I literally threw it in park, got out of the car, and started banging on his driver window and screaming. 

Went for cd13 ultra and ovidrel shot this morning. Was horrible ass to check-in staff. Burst into tears,  apologized to same person on way out of appt. We both cried. 

I'm ashamed of this behavior and frankly I'm terrified by it too. Husband is (rightfully) seething from morning interaction.  And he doesn't even know about the rest of it (taxi, etc. )  my brain feels stuck in ""fight"" mode today. I actually canceled eat of my afternoon because today I'm human equivalent of a scary growling dog.

FFS, if I can't handle one night of sleep deprivation how the fuck am I going to handle a pregnancy or infant?! I'm losing it... 

I feel ashamed that my husband is the gung-ho one and I'm cautiously participating. I do feel I want kids, but not at expense of my own sanity... just feeling fucked up gender guilt about not being super into this. Motherhood hasn't been my life dream, just one part of a life I planned.  

4th IUI tomorrow. RE is pushing IVF and I have about 100 reservations,  chief of which is my fear all the injections and hormones are gonna cause a psychic break. I mean the letrazole and ovidrel make me moody already.  My goddamn system is naturally sensitive already. 

I feel alone and despondent.  Sister has 3 month, SIL a for month, best friend a 4 month and oh, did I mention my boss had one last June? At one point all four of the were pregnant at same time. Best friend just totally doesn't fucking get it, was a one-and-done affair for her when trying. Had difficult NICU experience,  so not all roses for her either. Other best friend is in midst of divorce. 

Please tell me someone else feels this level of rage sometimes... I'm just so ashamed. And so angry and lonely. I want to kick my ""it's gonna happen for us"" husband in the teeth sometimes.

This was really hard information for me to accept at the time.  I felt absolutely worthless and damaged...like a factory error.  I had never in a million years thought I would have this problem.   We tried IVF and were unsuccessful. My wife was so brave throughout the whole process that I developed an even deeper love for her.  The day of the fertilization I gave my sample and felt I somehow had messed it up.  I knew as soon as I saw the pictures of the embryos that they were not going to develop.  After 8 days they told my wife she was pregnant and then the day after her hormone levels dropped.  She knew the whole time that she wasn't pregnant.  It was a crushing experience for us as a couple and it was an emotional roller coaster.  We are at a point now where she is unsure if she wants kids.  She has said if I get pregnant obviously I will keep it...but she doesn't seem that stoked.  It has caused a lot of challenges in our marriage but we have worked through them all.  I have no interest in doing any kind of egg donation...I figure if I can't do this with her then I am ok with it.  It's just hard to accept.  


I started doing research and began to look into whether or not I had a varicocele. I got an ultrasound and the radiologist ruled that I did indeed have a very small varicocele.


The first doctor I went to was super creepy (did an exam without gloves...is this common?) and told me: ""I have patients with massive varicoceles that have five kids and I have patients with no varicoceles who are childless."" He said he could do the procedure (via X ray) and that it might help. The second doctor said it was a waste of time and that all of us guys have varicoceles.
Is it worth it to get the surgery? I am covered by insurance but I have some irrational fears (e.g. they will mess up and I will be impotent). Should I try acupuncture?

I don't have the ""bag of worms"" but I notice that my right testicle always feels ""tight."" The only way I can describe it is that it feels like it is too high at times and being held taught by something, almost as if it's twisted.

I would be grateful for any feedback or info from someone who has gone through this.  Is having the surgery going to do anything about my deformed sperm?  Am I putting my wife at risk by trying to get her pregnant over the age of 40?  Are we increasing the risk of having a baby with down syndrome?

Currently in the middle of my first IVF cycle - retrieval is Sunday and I‚Äôve responded quite well. We always planned on doing a fresh transfer, but this morning my RE mentioned that it was quite likely that would be cancelled and we would have to do a frozen transfer at a later date (not doing PGS/PGD). However, the nurse called me this afternoon and said it IS still a possibility but will depend on how I feel after the retrieval on Sunday. 

Now this is why it‚Äôs a tricky decision for us: 

- we have 2 more weeks off from work and want to do a quick trip down to the south west of the USA, if we don‚Äôt do a fresh transfer, we get to tack on 4 days to our vacation 

- fresh transfer is included in the cost of IVF that we already paid, a frozen transfer is $1500, even if you‚Äôre not able to do a fresh one at all

<p>Currently in the middle of my first IVF cycle - retrieval is Sunday and I‚Äôve responded quite well. We always planned on doing a fresh transfer, but this morning my RE mentioned that it was quite likely that would be cancelled and we would have to do a frozen transfer at a later date (not doing PGS/PGD). However, the nurse called me this afternoon and said it IS still a possibility but will depend on how I feel after the retrieval on Sunday. </p>

<p>Now this is why it‚Äôs a tricky decision for us: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>we have 2 more weeks off from work and want to do a quick trip down to the south west of the USA, if we don‚Äôt do a fresh transfer, we get to tack on 4 days to our vacation </p></li>
<li><p>fresh transfer is included in the cost of IVF that we already paid, a frozen transfer is $1500, even if you‚Äôre not able to do a fresh one at all </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Should we have a longer vacation and spend an extra $1500 when we don‚Äôt have to? Or aim for a fresh and risk having that it will be cancelled anyways, and still have to pay the $1500? </p>

154,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I was very nervous before mine, which was yesterday, so I thought I‚Äôd share for anyone who has one coming up.

I‚Äôd previously had a questionable HSG, and follow up SIS showed a definite 1cm polyp. As soon as that was seen, hysteroscopy and polypectomy were recommended. Luckily, scheduling worked out so that they were all scheduled for consecutive cycles, all towards the end of my periods.

My clinic doesn‚Äôt do hysteroscopy on-site, so it was scheduled at one of their affiliated hospital sites. I talked to my doctor over the phone about the procedure, plus a couple of questions over the patient portal. There were several calls from the hospital for scheduling and instructions.

We arrived a little early, so breezed through registration and preop check-in. Then I was called back to a room to go through the preop procedures. First, I had to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. Then, changed clothes, reviewed meds/history, got hooked up to monitors, etc. They also gave me Tylenol, gabapentin, and celebrex to help reduce how much narcotic I‚Äôd need. Then they placed an IV and started fluid.

At that point, they let my husband and parents come in and hang out. It was a bit of a wait because of how early we‚Äôd arrived. Pretty soon, I needed to pee from the iv fluids, so there was an awkward walk down the hall trying to find an open restroom.

The surgeon stopped by quickly to say hi and brought his resident. Incidentally, my own doctor couldn‚Äôt make it because of an emergency scheduling change, so one of her more senior partners was doing it, which she had warned me about the day before. Personally, I was ok with that and with having a resident because I know having a second pair of hands in the OR helps immensely - plus their residents never rotate with our department, so I knew I‚Äôd never have to work with her professionally, just as a patient.

The OR nurse came in to say hi, and then my family was sent back to the waiting room. The anesthesiologist came by to review a few things. The CRNA then came in, we reviewed things again. I thought I would need a breathing tube, but she assured me that she would just be doing deep sedation. Then she gave me a small dose of sedative. The last thing I remember is telling her that I was feeling it working. I don‚Äôt even remember rolling out to the OR.

The next thing I remember is waking up in a different bed, in the recovery room. My husband and dad were already there. I felt pretty out of it and don‚Äôt remember too much of the conversation. Apparently, my husband wanted to take a video and I told him to just remember it instead. üòù

I do remember asking what the surgeon said and if I could get a copy of the operative note. The surgeon apparently found the polyp seen on SIS, plus some ‚Äúmini polyps‚Äù, all of which he removed. He also said something about a flap, which my husband wasn‚Äôt clear about. They think these were inflammatory polyps, possibly from the IUD I had. The op note wasn‚Äôt finished yet, so I‚Äôll have to get it from my doctor.

My parents switched, they gave some discharge instructions, then my husband left to pick up prescriptions and bring the car to the front. They prescribed 600mg ibuprofen, an antibiotic to prevent infection, plus estrace and provera to prevent adhesions. My mom helped me change back into my clothes, which was good, because I was still pretty wooozy. She also had the pad I‚Äôd brought, because I didn‚Äôt want to use the bulky hospital ones. Then we wheeled out and got in the car to go home.

Then, it‚Äôs on to the next IUI in March. We may end up moving on to IVF after that round, since this has thrown off our original IUI schedule so much - February was supposed to have been the third and final IUI, but both January and February had to be canceled for this.

<p>I‚Äôd previously had a questionable HSG, and follow up SIS showed a definite 1cm polyp. As soon as that was seen, hysteroscopy and polypectomy were recommended. Luckily, scheduling worked out so that they were all scheduled for consecutive cycles, all towards the end of my periods.</p>

<p>My clinic doesn‚Äôt do hysteroscopy on-site, so it was scheduled at one of their affiliated hospital sites. I talked to my doctor over the phone about the procedure, plus a couple of questions over the patient portal. There were several calls from the hospital for scheduling and instructions.</p>

<p>We arrived a little early, so breezed through registration and preop check-in. Then I was called back to a room to go through the preop procedures. First, I had to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. Then, changed clothes, reviewed meds/history, got hooked up to monitors, etc. They also gave me Tylenol, gabapentin, and celebrex to help reduce how much narcotic I‚Äôd need. Then they placed an IV and started fluid.</p>

<p>At that point, they let my husband and parents come in and hang out. It was a bit of a wait because of how early we‚Äôd arrived. Pretty soon, I needed to pee from the iv fluids, so there was an awkward walk down the hall trying to find an open restroom.</p>

<p>The surgeon stopped by quickly to say hi and brought his resident. Incidentally, my own doctor couldn‚Äôt make it because of an emergency scheduling change, so one of her more senior partners was doing it, which she had warned me about the day before. Personally, I was ok with that and with having a resident because I know having a second pair of hands in the OR helps immensely - plus their residents never rotate with our department, so I knew I‚Äôd never have to work with her professionally, just as a patient.</p>

<p>The OR nurse came in to say hi, and then my family was sent back to the waiting room. The anesthesiologist came by to review a few things. The CRNA then came in, we reviewed things again. I thought I would need a breathing tube, but she assured me that she would just be doing deep sedation. Then she gave me a small dose of sedative. The last thing I remember is telling her that I was feeling it working. I don‚Äôt even remember rolling out to the OR.</p>

<p>The next thing I remember is waking up in a different bed, in the recovery room. My husband and dad were already there. I felt pretty out of it and don‚Äôt remember too much of the conversation. Apparently, my husband wanted to take a video and I told him to just remember it instead. üòù</p>

<p>I do remember asking what the surgeon said and if I could get a copy of the operative note. The surgeon apparently found the polyp seen on SIS, plus some ‚Äúmini polyps‚Äù, all of which he removed. He also said something about a flap, which my husband wasn‚Äôt clear about. They think these were inflammatory polyps, possibly from the IUD I had. The op note wasn‚Äôt finished yet, so I‚Äôll have to get it from my doctor.</p>

<p>My parents switched, they gave some discharge instructions, then my husband left to pick up prescriptions and bring the car to the front. They prescribed 600mg ibuprofen, an antibiotic to prevent infection, plus estrace and provera to prevent adhesions. My mom helped me change back into my clothes, which was good, because I was still pretty wooozy. She also had the pad I‚Äôd brought, because I didn‚Äôt want to use the bulky hospital ones. Then we wheeled out and got in the car to go home.</p>

My entire ""journey"" so far has been about 9 months. I can't imagine the pain of doing this for years and have a ton of respect for women who do that). 

I've never even gotten to transfer during that time. The first two rounds produced no embryos, the third produced one aneuploid blast. I'm incredibly fortunate that I live in Illinois, where the first four rounds of IVF are covered, hence the financial commitment has been fairly minimal (couple hundred for meds, couple hundred for surgeries and $4k for PGS. All in, I think I've spent maybe $6k). So now I have this fourth covered round. Under Illinois law, I can apply it to a donor (still have to pay the donor and legal fees but the IVF is covered). Frankly, I'm at a point where I'm fairly pragmatic: I want a child and I'm interested in the most efficient means.

165,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone,

I went through my first egg retrieval last month, and it was brutal. My clinic doesn't put you right under, but instead does what they call ""twilight sedation."" I was told that I wouldn't remember much, and wouldn't have any pain during the procedure. 

That was definitely not the case. I remember quite a bit of it (although it's foggy in spots) and had a lot of pain during the procedure. I especially remember an awful stabbing sensation in my left ovary that made it impossible for me to breathe. I now have nightmares about being stabbed from the inside out and wake up sweating and shaking. 

Before the retrieval, the nurse had a difficult time placing the IV, and afterwards, I had a big bruise from my thumb to below my wrist (the IV was in my hand). 

I've been wondering if I should say anything about this to the doctor during our WTF appointment in a couple of weeks. The retrieval was incredibly painful and traumatic for me. Is it possible the IV wasn't placed properly, which is why I don't seem to have gotten the full effect of the drugs? Apparently the nurse administered additional pain meds 3 times during the procedure, but they didn't seem to do anything for me. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

<p>I went through my first egg retrieval last month, and it was brutal. My clinic doesn&#39;t put you right under, but instead does what they call &quot;twilight sedation.&quot; I was told that I wouldn&#39;t remember much, and wouldn&#39;t have any pain during the procedure. </p>

<p>That was definitely not the case. I remember quite a bit of it (although it&#39;s foggy in spots) and had a lot of pain during the procedure. I especially remember an awful stabbing sensation in my left ovary that made it impossible for me to breathe. I now have nightmares about being stabbed from the inside out and wake up sweating and shaking. </p>

<p>Before the retrieval, the nurse had a difficult time placing the IV, and afterwards, I had a big bruise from my thumb to below my wrist (the IV was in my hand). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wondering if I should say anything about this to the doctor during our WTF appointment in a couple of weeks. The retrieval was incredibly painful and traumatic for me. Is it possible the IV wasn&#39;t placed properly, which is why I don&#39;t seem to have gotten the full effect of the drugs? Apparently the nurse administered additional pain meds 3 times during the procedure, but they didn&#39;t seem to do anything for me. Has anyone else had a similar experience?</p>

167,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,
I recently posted here for the first time and got some really helpful insight and questions to ask my doctor. Here is the link to the previous thread.
https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7ulon3/question_about_third_fet/

My doctor spoke with me over the phone for over 45 minutes on Monday and I saw her again in person yesterday at the office for another hour long appointment where we discussed my concerns. 

So here were a couple of questions I had and what her response was just in case this is helpful to anyone:
1. My lining was 9.25mm for 2nd FET, and 12.57mm the first FET. This was her reasoning for lowering the estrogen dose from 6mg from the first round to 5mm the second time. She said she is happy with anything between 8mm and 13mm but lowered the dose in case the thicker uterine lining the first time contributed in anyway.
2. ERA: I wondered why she was hesitant about this. She said in MY case she would not recommend this now because I didn't do PGS testing. She said its really only for people who know they have completely normal embryos and if god forbid I have to do another round of IVF then we should do PGS and consider ERA. This makes SO MUCH more sense to me so I'm glad I asked about it. Why bother trying to figure out if the soil is bad if you don't even know if the seeds are 100% good?
3. Hysteroscopy: She recommends doing an SHG and scraping first. If SHG is abnormal, then definitely consider hysteroscopy, if its normal then we can talk about it and schedule it in the next few weeks if I still want it. I'm a total moron and thought I had a polyp, I don't! I have a fibroid that is on the outside of the uterine wall and nowhere near the body of the uterus. She said all my ultrasounds have been normal and hormone testing has been good so far so there's no reason to jump to it first. If we do the hysteroscopy, she will just rescrape then. Okay so now I feel much better about this plan!
4. I told her I have had painful periods and she said I could have endometriosis but the treatment for that when trying to get pregnant is doing IUI and IVF (which obviously we are already doing). She said that would not change any of her previous treatments or future plans because my progesterone and estrogen levels have been fine. She said when I am not trying to get pregnant (sheesh, when will that be?!) that I should consider surgery and biopsies to diagnose it just to be aware of the diagnosis if its there.
5. I asked about intralipids, other anticoagulants, or other meds I could possibly take, steroids, etc and she said there are no studies on these showing any improvement in pregnancy rates.

I feel so much better about everything and I really want to thank everyone here for boosting my confidence and recommending that I be an advocate for myself. I hope someone reads this and it gives them the confidence just to ask the questions they might want to. Thank you to you all, you are all beautiful unicorns of this world and don't let anyone ever make you think differently.

Quick edit to thank every one of you for your comments and support. You are all wonderful people. I will get back to you in the following days. I can still only manage to get hold of my emotions a little at the time, so I am easily overwhelmed. Lots of love peeps.


Let me start by apologizing because this post will probably be a wall of text. 
I wish to update you about what happened in the last 10 days, why I went almost no contact with the community and I also hope that one day reading back this post will provide me more insights into my life and future.

On Monday 29th January I went to the ward to have my ER. I arrived at 7 am as per request, and I was assigned to my bed at about 8 am. I soon discovered they didn't really know who I was and what my procedure was (my name was spelt wrong on the nurses' board and my file was missing). 
My ER was scheduled at 9.30 but I was first visited by the nurse for admission at 9.10. At 9.20 I received my gown, my fashionable white stockings and while I was rolled into the OT they stopped us because they forgot to take my urine test. 
Meanwhile, my partner was downstairs to provide his sample and even in the fertility unit, they could not find my folder and my notes. We were communicating by text message and we were both upset and apprehensive. It was not the best start. 

Once I was at the OT the anesthesiologist team started prepping me for the spinal block. They also needed to put an IV in, and as usual, they decided to place in the back of my hand. 
First small trauma: the anaesthetist decided not to use the rubber band to pop my vein, and instead proceeded to grab hold of my arm with his bare hand. He held me so tight that I had bruises with the shape of his fingers for the next few days. 
Now, I don't know if it is standard practice but my anxiety skyrocketed (in the following days I realised that it trigger a panic attack because it unconsciously reminded me of my one and only physical abusive relationship - I didn't voice a complaint I just froze emotionally and physically). 
Then they proceeded with the spinal injection and this time I couldn't control myself, and I let out a high pitched cry. The nurses found it hilarious, so much so that one of them said: ""Oh, there is another one incoming, so let's get ready for more singing"". I wasn't amused, but I had to stay completely still due to the procedure and I was by then in the first state of shock. 

When they wheeled me in the OT and placed me on the table, I could still feel pressure and slight surface feeling on my tummy/legs (I was reprimanded not to wiggle my toes as I could cause my legs to fall down and get hurt). They moved my IV sack and dropped on my tummy just before the scanning started, and since the screen was up and I didn't see that happening, I jumped when I felt something hitting my belly. Once more I was reprimanded by the anaesthetist to not be so ""jumpy"".

When the ER procedure began it was my Gyno doctor performing it. She had to ask the rest of the team to turn the lights down, to close the doors and be silent several times. Every time the OT team gave her rolling eyes behind her back. The ER started at 10.30, and while I felt no pain I could feel everything else that was happening down there: motion, pressure, movement wise. It was a completely different experience from the first time. 

I think by halfway through it I was in a full-blown panic attack, but still, the anaesthetist did not push any sedative in. Actually, he tried once more to convince me to get Ibuprofen suppositories for the recovery (I had refused once before in the prep room because my fertility team had me on no Ibuprofen regime for months - I found it weird they were suggesting me the opposite so I decided to refuse it). 

Once the collection was over I couldn't understand what my doctor was trying to tell me, partly because I was in a panic state, partly because the rest of team had resumed their chatting (English is not my first language as well). I thought she said she had flushed my tube to help the process (and I felt a lot of liquid moving in my belly during the procedure), but I could not swear that was what she said. Once she left the OT the staff there started to badmouth her too (forgetting I was there awake?).

When they brought me to recovery my BP dropped and so did my core temperature. Both things can happen with the spinal block, but it was still scary and upsetting. I was shaking from head to toes. 

In that moment the whole emotional burden of the IVF process poured on me at once. I started crying because I felt extremely overwhelmed and I felt that that day was the horrible ending of a cycle that I had felt distant and so ill at ease with. In those moments I thought of many of you, I remember asking myself how do you all manage to go through this several times. I admired your strength and your tenacity while I felt so small and a failure in comparison. 

After a couple of hours I was back in the ward, still shaking but with a normal BP. Unfortunately, the ward has a strict policy about visitors so my partner could not come and check on me until 2 pm. Although, even when he arrived I could not tell him much, as I didn't know how many follicles were drained during ER (I am not sure they even told me). We only knew they would not have attempted to recover anything from the left ovary as they were concerned it had developed a cyst and they were afraid of infections. 

It was a long afternoon, while we waited for the anaesthesia to wear off and for the fertility team to come to us to tell us how many eggs they collected. My last scan on the previous Friday showed 9 follicles, but only 3 big ones. 
It was 5 pm when a nurse came to tell us they only got 3 eggs. 
We were disappointed but we also knew that what was done was done and it was out of our control. I was told they would organise a scan in radiology to have a better assessment of the left ovary and I was discharged. 

Tuesday morning I received a phone call from the embryologist lab telling me only 2 eggs fertilised. The hospital does not provide day3 reports on PGD embryos so we were told to expect a call on Saturday. 
The following two days were rough. I was in pain both from my belly and my back. In addition, every time I saw the bruises on my arm I fell a little sick to my stomach and angry. In the end, I couldn't shake off the feeling of doom of this whole situation for the rest of the week. I didn't feel ready for my ER and since it went pretty bad my feeling of worry and uneasiness mounted. 

Saturday arrived, but I received no phone call. I tried to call myself, but the lines are disconnected during the weekend so there was no chance to get through to the lab. I felt extremely hurt, disappointed and angry.

On Monday morning I went it first thing in the morning to attend my scan and since I was there I walked upstairs to the fertility clinic and I asked to know my results (I explained nobody called me with day5 report). I felt it was bad news since the missed phonecall but when they made me sit in the counselling room I remember thinking ""well, that's it. We lost also these two"". I wasn't however prepared to receive the worst part of the update regarding the loss of our embryos. 

Apparently, both my IVF cycles produced EC blastocysts, meaning that they did not contain any cell for the development of a fetus. The doctor was adamant in telling me that is a very rare occurrence and that having this same result twice meant that there is something really wrong with our genetic material. He mainly commented on the quality of my eggs, but he did not exclude it could also be caused by the sperm. 

At the end of a very long talk, the core of his message was: 
- we expect this to happen if you try again, therefore we won't provide you with another funded cycle (even if the official review of my file will be in March);
- we can't tell you why this happens (and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying);
- we won't investigate this any further;
- we can't provide any treatment for this due to all the above.

He suggested egg donation which could have a higher chance of success, but even if this is a self-funded procedure, they still have a 2-year long waiting list. 

I won't delve into how we feel about egg donation in this post because it is a topic that my partner and I still need to discuss in detail. I am just having a very hard time accepting this additional truckload of shit that is suffocating me. 

Until Monday I had this feeling of mourning for my lost embryos, now I feel like I was emotionally invested into empty cell sacks. There was nothing to mourn because my body is not able to produce any form of life. 

Many of you know that I have a degenerative muscular disease, which is not curable and a series of other ""not fixable"" medical conditions that I had to accept as a part of me in order to move on. Well, ladies and gents, I am done accepting and moving on. I can't do it anymore. I am upset, I am angry and I want to scream it at the top of my lungs how unfair this situation is. 
I feel I scraped the bottom of the barrel of my resources, I am left without any energy to stand up and fight this. I am defeated and broken. And I never felt so empty in my life, it is a constant dull pain in my heart that I can't shake off or mend.

I cut off contacts with most of my family and friends because I find it too hard to explain what happened, and I also feel a little bit of shame into having to admit that everything I did, the energy we invested and what we shared with them was all for nothing.

My insurance doesn't cover infertility, so I'm really hesitant about seeing an RE. I've been seeing a gynecologist about my infertility (supposedly because of PCOS but I think there's more to it) but after having tried Clomid (which made me ovulate but still no baby), a D&C to remove polyps, a HSG test, etc. he was stumped and referred me to an RE. 

I'd LOVE to see an RE but I absolutely do not want to shell out thousands of dollars out of my pocket for a few procedures, treatments, meds, etc. that have a chance of not working at all. 

I was wondering if any of you had any advice on saving as much money as possible on RE visits. Is there such a thing as a low cost RE? Can I inquire about self pay rates?

I have always had problems with my periods and have been on the Pill since I was 16. Several years ago, my OBGYN told me I had ovarian cysts and 1 of them became calcified. I thought...NBD and very UNLIKE me, I never even looked up how serious cysts can become. 

Well, I got married in July of 2016, and with the biological clock ticking (I'm now 35), my husband and I knew we'd want to start trying right away. Fast forward a few months later and one of my problems from the past reared its ugly head- I started bleeding between periods again due to the cysts. She wanted me to come in and take a blood test. The results came back with a high CA-level, and after the gynecological oncologist appointment, it was decided to remove the cysts if possible and the offending ovary, if needed, since there would be no way to tell if the cysts we're cancerous or not until a procedure or surgery was done. I thought, Hey! I've never had problems with the right ovary, and my mom had all 3 of us with just one, so I'll get that left b!tch outta me and be pregnant shortly thereafter. When I woke up I received good news along with devastating news. They had to remove the whole ovary and at least it wasn't cancerous (it was a very small chance it was in the 1st place), but endometriosis had swallowed up my right ovary...we can't get pregnant without IVF.  

I had NO IDEA I had issues on the right side. Maybe I would've waited for the left ovary surgery, maybe not, but I definitely would've asked if we could try to save eggs from the left  ovary after its removal. I sobbed. And was grateful it wasn't cancer. And sobbed again. 

Finally, I made the IVF appointment. After hearing my story, we got more bad news...he gave us a 99% chance of failure if we tried to use my eggs, and now we need a donor, but...do we really?

Can we try to salvage the eggs I have in the right ovary that are trapped by the endometriosis by removing it entirely? The doctors told me the right ovary would have to come out eventually, anyways.

If we really do have to use a donor, isn't there a better way to find someone other than using an agency that charges you $15K and more? We even thought about posting the ""job"" on Craigslist and holding interviews, doing our own background checks, etc.

207,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, bit of a novel here but it‚Äôs really a PSA. I thought I‚Äôd let you know my story so far - it deals with OHSS and my symptoms or lacktherof!

First round of ivf was this month, after 2 years of trying. Both me and my husband are 33, he‚Äôs got some dna frag and antisperm antibodies, I had extremely long cycles (40-50 days) and couldn‚Äôt prove I was ovulating so here we are.

Anyway ivf for me was injecting gonal f in the evenings and cetrocide in the mornings. Ladies who fear injections I was shocked at how easy they were! 

In fact, I was surprised at how easy it was generally. The first week I was fine, no moods, no pain, no bloating ... just fine! I did start to have a low level sick & headachey feeling but nothing unusual for me. 

Second week they started to scan me- mon & wed, and I was definitely feeling sick by now so I mentioned it to the nurses, but my main concern was the fact I wasn‚Äôt in any pain or had any bloating - I was afraid it wasn‚Äôt working. By Fri however I was feeling crappy all round and let the nurse know! She was surprised I wasn‚Äôt feeling bloated cause low and behold my ovaries were 10cm each. 

It turns out they were big because I had so many follicles, they had to cancel the fresh transfer due to fear of ohss! Ovarian hyper super duper syndrome or whatever it‚Äôs called. I was so disappointed! Instead of getting my transfer in a couple of days I now find out I have to freeze any blastocysts we get and wait a cycle or two til my ovaries calm down.

Anyway, today I had my egg collection and after the procedure while coming out of the sleep I heard the nurses talking about me, they were wondering why I hadn‚Äôt rung them up to let them know I wasn‚Äôt feeling well? 

Well let me tell you ladies, my symptoms were nowhere near as bad as a bad period. I‚Äôve had worse pain with a migraine. This just did not rate on my pain monitor as serious - but I want to say to anyone else going through this: pay attention to your body! Nausea and shortness of breath - however mild are SERIOUS. You need to let the clinic know straight away. Even if it‚Äôs just a little sick, even if it doesn‚Äôt stop you from eating, even if you‚Äôre drinking gallons of water every day - let them know.

We now not only have to wait an extra couple of months but pay extra money for the frozen egg transfer. 

On the plus side I got a yummy dinner of burritos made by my husband so you know, every cloud. üòâ  Seriously though I hope this helps someone, I read everything I could get my hands on about ohss and ivf I just didn‚Äôt realise I had it.

I thought I‚Äôd let you know my story so far - it deals with OHSS and my symptoms or lacktherof!</p>

<p>First round of ivf was this month, after 2 years of trying. Both me and my husband are 33, he‚Äôs got some dna frag and antisperm antibodies, I had extremely long cycles (40-50 days) and couldn‚Äôt prove I was ovulating so here we are.</p>

<p>Anyway ivf for me was injecting gonal f in the evenings and cetrocide in the mornings. Ladies who fear injections I was shocked at how easy they were! </p>

<p>In fact, I was surprised at how easy it was generally. The first week I was fine, no moods, no pain, no bloating ... just fine! I did start to have a low level sick &amp; headachey feeling but nothing unusual for me. </p>

<p>Second week they started to scan me- mon &amp; wed, and I was definitely feeling sick by now so I mentioned it to the nurses, but my main concern was the fact I wasn‚Äôt in any pain or had any bloating - I was afraid it wasn‚Äôt working. By Fri however I was feeling crappy all round and let the nurse know! She was surprised I wasn‚Äôt feeling bloated cause low and behold my ovaries were 10cm each. </p>

<p>It turns out they were big because I had so many follicles, they had to cancel the fresh transfer due to fear of ohss! Ovarian hyper super duper syndrome or whatever it‚Äôs called. I was so disappointed! Instead of getting my transfer in a couple of days I now find out I have to freeze any blastocysts we get and wait a cycle or two til my ovaries calm down.</p>

<p>Anyway, today I had my egg collection and after the procedure while coming out of the sleep I heard the nurses talking about me, they were wondering why I hadn‚Äôt rung them up to let them know I wasn‚Äôt feeling well? </p>

Anywho, I'm slightly masochistic, so clicked the link to their registry and I was SO annoyed with a few items on there and the little cutesy messages about why it was needed from the parents-to-be. Nursing shirts and scarves for mom (okay, not totally out there), a Doordash type gift card because ""sometimes we want food but are too tired to cook"" (eye roll), a food list sign-up for everyone to make them homecooked meals (now you're starting to piss me off) and a $350 6-person tent because their old one ""is only built for two"" (retch). 

I was dumbfounded--you're having a baby, so your friends need to make you dinner and buy you new hobby gear? I know, I'm being Judgy McJudgerson over here. I'm PMSing, what can I say? I think it annoyed me the most that the couple sent this out--not a family member/friend. I may be old fashioned, but usually meal sign-ups and other manual labor is offered and organized by a friend, not solicited by the couple. But, whatever. Not my movie. 

To make ourselves feel better, Mr. Bot and I started joking about how we should start an infertility registry. Why should people with babies on the way get all the goods? It brought us a few laughs, so I thought I would share. Feel free to add on! I'm not even in active treatment yet, so I'm sure you all have even better ones to add!

Our IF Registry:
-Multiple copies of ""Taking Charge of your fertility"" (to rip up and/or burn). 

-Cozy socks for gyno visits 

-Loose boxers for Mr. Bot (let's not boil that sperm)

-Porn magazines, not from the 80s, for SAs (Mr. Bot's idea, haha)

-A subscription to Avocado of the month club (another addittion from Mr. Bot, my is he witty!)

-Body armor for the next person who tells me to take a vacation or relax

-10 sessions of couples counseling

-An all expense paid trip to Hawaii (the magical, baby-making vacation everyone talks about)

-A gift card for an accupuncturist/herbalist (it won't cure our infertility, but at least it will shut up people who ask if I've tried it)

-Toys for our dog (our stress makes this wannabe big sister a little anxious, and when she's anxious, she needs to chew on something)

-Take out gift cards (because sometimes we want food and are too tired to cook too, like 99% of other Americans I imagine).

-A house cleaner (the crushing depression of IF, along with chronic pain that never existed before this, sometimes makes me too exhausted to clean my house)

-A new puppy (cuz puppies are cute and make me happy)

-Wine (so much wine)

Edited: I just wanted to add, I don't normally scrutinize my friends' registries and I don't begrudge anyone a gift. I love celebrating my friends and family. I've had a rough week of pain, losing our cat, and extreme PMS. I know I don't need to explain any of this to y'all, but I felt like I should.

As some of you already know, I did my first IVF cycle in October and failed with 0 normal embryos. I was told that this was a total fluke and we should do the same thing for round 2. Because we're 100% out of pocket and I asked repeatedly, we will get $4,500 off our next cycle with this RE. Great news, but something didn't feel right about doing it 100% the same way again. 

 In January, I got a second opinion with another RE who disagreed. She thinks I have poor egg quality because I have very high testosterone (thanks PCOS) and it's making the eggs crappy. She suggests doing ovarian diathermy to control the hormones, then doing a second round of ivf a couple months later. This would hopefully produce way better eggs, making the whole process better. 

My question is: Am I ~allowed~ to have the ovarian diathermy with RE #2, and then go back to RE #1 to do our discounted cycle? 

I have no idea if this is against some sort of medical rule, and honestly I don't want to call either clinic to ask, in case they get pissed off that I'm bopping around for the sake of money. 

I would be perfectly fine just asking RE 1 to do the surgery, but that clinic doesn't do it.

So yesterday I had my foam echo. It's a method that does not hurt like a normal hsg does. 
I was very nervous, because the day before the echo I had very painful intercourse with my husband. It felt like a new spot of endo has formed on the outside on top of my uterus. When the internal echo was put inside me, I felt exact the same pain.  But the foam echo is such a relief if I compare it to what I have read about hsg. You only feel menstruation cramps during the moment they fill your uterus with the foam. For the average endometriosis patient normal menstruation cramps are nothing. 
End result: my left tube is closed. My right one is open.  According to my gyn I have to undergo a laparoscopy again. 
Oh well. I just felt like sharing my story. Does anyone here have got experience with the foam echo? Is it true that most people are more fertile in the months after a treatment like this? And stories about clearing the fallopian tubes via laparoscopy are also welcome. 

Don't mind my spelling. I don't know all abbreviations, I'm Dutch.

Foamecho The foamecho (schuimecho) is a quick way to demonstrate the patency of the fallopian tubes. It is a vaginal ultrasound examination in which the inside of the uterus and the fallopian tubes is made visible by leading foam into the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes. On the ultrasound image, the course of the foam is visible as a white discolouration. This echo takes place in the first half of the cycle and your possible fertility treatment can usually continue. The research With the foamecho you have an empty bladder, a speculum is inserted and a thin tube (catheter) is inserted into the cervix. The speculum is removed and a vaginal ultrasound is inserted.

236,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I started writing this in the daily thread, but it quickly got out of hand and I realized that it was long and ridiculous enough for its own post. I'd like to preface this by saying that I know how incredibly lucky I am to have any insurance coverage at all for infertility, and don't want to seem ungrateful or whining - but yesterday was so absurdly overwhelming, I really need to vent to someone. So, without further ado - 

**Yesterday over the course of 9 hours, THIS happened:**

1. We went from thinking we were starting IVF #1 as an estrogen priming protocol next month, to thinking we're instead starting an antagonist protocol *next week*, and then back to thinking we're doing EPP next month - all due to miscommunication among the staff at our clinic, and the nurses' willingness to brush aside our questions and just *make shit up* rather than double-check with our RE.

2. As a result of the above, we sat through a 2-hour IVF nursing consult (and I wasted 4 hours of precious sick leave) to learn about *the wrong protocol.* I also wasted hours of time earlier in the week getting price quotes from various pharmacies... all for the wrong protocol. (I hope the meds/doses are similar?)

3. I was told by my insurance company that my specialty medication to treat inflammatory bowel disease (Humira) had been mistakenly billed as an infertility med - and at over $9k per month, I therefore had no fertility coverage left for the IVF I thought I was starting next week.

4. I went from thinking I had $10k of fertility med coverage, to being told I had $0 left, to being told I had **$9,999,999.99** of coverage üò≤, to being told that I actually had $20k of coverage, to finally realizing that it doesn't even matter, because however much coverage I have, that's how much insurance will say one cycle costs (""oh, you have $10k of coverage? Well that's lucky, because that's how much we charge for Follstim!"").

5. While locked in my office at work, I made 8 phone calls to insurance/pharmacies/patient advocate totaling 3 hours and 36 minutes, including an **epic 1-hour-and-54-minute 4-way conference call** with my insurance company, CVS Specialty Care's fertility team, and CVS Specialty Care's autoimmune team in order to figure out what the hell was going on in #3 & 4. I felt like I really bonded with Emerald, Deborah, and Angela, who all agreed that it was ""truly a one-of-a-kind call"" that will go down in history among customer service calls that are recorded for quality assurance. (""at least this hold music isn't too terrible;"" ""if you really had $10 million, I bet you wouldn't spend it all on fertility meds!"" ""well, it *does* really add up"")

6. Re: #3, 4 & 5 - It seems that when my husband's employer (a very large company) updated their fertility benefits on 1/1/18, ""someone must have coded something wrong"" resulting in all non-fertility meds being billed as fertility meds, and all fertility meds being billed as standard medical care (thus the $10 million/""unlimited"" coverage) *for all of the employees on that insurance plan*. Apparently out of thousands and thousands of employees and dependents on this plan across the United States, I'm the first person on specialty medication for a chronic condition to also inquire about IVF meds in 2018 - so I was the lucky unicorn tasked with catching the error and spending nearly 4 hours on the phone until someone could figure it out.

7. Unbeknownst to me, my patient advocate at our secondary insurance company spent the entire afternoon fighting for me on a completely separate issue - getting my clinic and the insurance company to sign a contract allowing me to proceed with treatment at all. Supposedly they're going to sign on Monday (after two months of getting my hopes up and then dragging their feet), but either way, the insurance finally gave us their word - in writing - that we can proceed!

8. When I finally got off the phone last night and drove home from work (where I didn't get much work done at all), Mr. Exposure Therapy and I drank one and a half bottles of wine and drunkenly wrote a list of all of the miscommunication issues we've had with the staff at our clinic (which we're going to clean up and present to our RE the next time we see her). We planned to spend the rest of the evening coloring copies of the ""FUCK"" page from our [Swear and Relax adult coloring book](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Sick-This-Swear-Relax/dp/1530049121) (gifted to us by the illustrious /u/mackiemouse), but we accidentally passed out on the couch before we could get to it.

**TL;DR Having a medical condition is a full-time job.**

In summary, literally everyone that I spoke to yesterday is expecting me to call back on Monday to rush-order my meds and start monitoring... but due to the confusion over our protocol, start date, and coverage, I now have to call them all back and sheepishly say ""never mind"" for another full month! I guess if there's any silver lining to yesterday, it's that it brought to light a bunch of financial/insurance issues that we weren't aware of, and we now have an extra four weeks to figure it out.


So... Could anyone tell me what we'll actually need for the estrogen priming protocol?

239,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all. Longtime lurker, reaching an emotional breaking point here. I don't have hardly anyone close in my life who's experienced infertility to talk to about this, so I'm seeking some camaraderie. (One bff had successful treatment and, infuriatingly, now tells me to ""relax,"" and one friend is having fertility issues but is not to treatment stages of it yet).

We just failed IUI #4 today. We tried ""naturally"" for a year, and after that, started our IF journey + assistance for a year. No diagnosable issues on my end or his, which makes this situation all the more frustrating. Literally have never even gotten a positive test, which is so infuriating.

I'm so over all this. Our clinic will do 6 IUIs and then reassess or bump us to IVF. But I don't want to do IVF. After discussing with my doctor and learning what it takes, I am not going to do it. I am not willing to put myself through that medical routine, that potential (inevitable?) heartache, that time suck. My husband agrees. We're not willing to go there. (Ladies who do it, you are so fucking tough and awesome‚ÄîI just can't.)

I talked to my RE recently and she said we can try another medication protocol after the first 6 IUIs (currently doing Clomid). Cool, I guess?

Adoption is absolutely on the table, and we've got a meeting with an agency this month, so it's not like we're totally out of options. And yet...

I am SO angry and sad and feeling alone. I hate my stupid fucking uterus. I hate medicine for not knowing shit about women's health. I hate that I am the one who has to go through all the invasive fertility procedures and scans while my partner thinks jerking in a cup is ""soooo awkward and icky."" (I'm not being generous here; he's starting to really understand and empathize. I'm just upset tonight.)

So I wonder: is anyone else drawing the line at IVF? Nobody ever seems to post about that in this sub. And is anyone else sad-crying this weekend? If you are, I offer virtual hugs and total understanding. This blows.

Longtime lurker, reaching an emotional breaking point here. I don&#39;t have hardly anyone close in my life who&#39;s experienced infertility to talk to about this, so I&#39;m seeking some camaraderie. (One bff had successful treatment and, infuriatingly, now tells me to &quot;relax,&quot; and one friend is having fertility issues but is not to treatment stages of it yet).</p>

<p>We just failed IUI #4 today. We tried &quot;naturally&quot; for a year, and after that, started our IF journey + assistance for a year. No diagnosable issues on my end or his, which makes this situation all the more frustrating. Literally have never even gotten a positive test, which is so infuriating.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so over all this. Our clinic will do 6 IUIs and then reassess or bump us to IVF. But I don&#39;t want to do IVF. After discussing with my doctor and learning what it takes, I am not going to do it. I am not willing to put myself through that medical routine, that potential (inevitable?) heartache, that time suck. My husband agrees. We&#39;re not willing to go there. (Ladies who do it, you are so fucking tough and awesome‚ÄîI just can&#39;t.)</p>

<p>I talked to my RE recently and she said we can try another medication protocol after the first 6 IUIs (currently doing Clomid). Cool, I guess?</p>

<p>Adoption is absolutely on the table, and we&#39;ve got a meeting with an agency this month, so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re totally out of options. And yet...</p>

<p>I am SO angry and sad and feeling alone. I hate my stupid fucking uterus. I hate medicine for not knowing shit about women&#39;s health. I hate that I am the one who has to go through all the invasive fertility procedures and scans while my partner thinks jerking in a cup is &quot;soooo awkward and icky.&quot; (I&#39;m not being generous here; he&#39;s starting to really understand and empathize. I&#39;m just upset tonight.)</p>

<p>So I wonder: is anyone else drawing the line at IVF? Nobody ever seems to post about that in this sub. And is anyone else sad-crying this weekend? If you are, I offer virtual hugs and total understanding. This blows.</p>

<p>Apologies if I should&#39;ve posted this in one of the weekly threads or something. I just don&#39;t know where else to turn with my sadness.</p>

241,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone-

As some of you know, I am a licensed [genetic counselor](https://www.nsgc.org), and occasionally I will see a post on this subreddit about genetics and infertility and, as part of my job is ensuring that my clients receive appropriate information and care, and, as someone suffering from infertility myself, I thought I would provide some resources in order to dispel some myths. I'm not here to tell anyone what to do, per se, but only make some recommendations about appropriate genetic evaluation versus inappropriate genetic evaluation, and give you some of the info to ask the questions and figure out whats best for you and your choices moving forward.

A couple of definitions first that I think may be helpful in providing context. You may know a lot of this first stuff especially, but it's helpful to give the basics first:

**Genetics 101**: you have two copies of every gene, one you inherited from mom and one from dad. The genes are all spelled out in long strands of DNA using the four letter genetic alphabet. DNA is then wound up really tightly and compacted into 23 pairs chromosomes- 22 regular pairs chromosomes (autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes.  You have DNA in virtually every cell of your body, and that DNA tells the cell how to form and function, with impact on every level you can imagine: from the nitty gritty functioning of that cell, all the way to eye and hair color and how your liver processes waste, etc. 

**Genetic vs. Heritable (or inherited)**: there is actually a difference between these two. 

A condition that is genetic is caused by something going on in your genes - a mutation in a gene, a deletion in a chromosome, etc., but it is not necessarily something you *inherited*. That genetic change may have happened randomly when you were just an egg or sperm yourself, or in an early stage of embryologic development. Thus, you may be the first person in your family to have it. Now that it exists though, it's there, so you can still pass it on to your own potential children. 

My point is that some people have something running in their family that does (or may) give multiple people risk of infertility or a specific condition. Others may just randomly have some unfortunate gene that decided to drop in on them. Not all tests will detect both of these causes. 

**When heritable disease happens**:
You may be familiar with terms like dominant and recessive relating to genetic (heritable) diseases. *Dominant* means that only one of the two copies of a gene has to have a mutation in order to cause the disease. That second normal copy is not enough to make up for the broken copy. An example would be achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism) or Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome caused by the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* genes. *Recessive* means that both copies have to be affected in order to cause the disease. If only one copy of a recessive gene has a mutation, the second healthy copy can pick up the slack so to speak. In that case, that person is a *carrier*- meaning they have one bad copy with a mutation, are usually perfectly healthy, but can pass that mutation on to a fetus. In our world, we usually talk about recessive conditions and being a carrier in the context of carrier screening for Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, etc.  The last one I'll mention is *X-linked*, meaning the gene is on the X chromosome, and thus whether or not it causes disease is often impacted by the sex of the person. Think of it like a recessive condition- a female has two X chromosomes, so if she has a mutation in an X-linked gene, her second X chromosome has the backup copy to pick up the slack and typically a girl will not be affected. A male only has one X chromosome plus a Y, which has a totally different set of genes on it. So if a male has a mutation in an X-linked gene, he has no back up copy of that gene, and thus would have the disease. (PLEASE NOTE: there are exceptions to this! X-linked disorders can be very complicated and impacted by other factors. This is just the basics, if you want an advanced genetics primer we can talk about that later)

**There are many types of genetic changes, and thus many tests to look at them. Not all of them are helpful.**

There are all sorts of alterations that can happen in genes: *mutations* are like spelling changes, *deletions* are like chunks missing, *duplications* are like extra chucks, *trinucleotide repeat expansions* are like run-on sentences, *methylation* disorders are like the bulbs are there but the light switch may be turned off, etc. The language can be very confusing. From this point on, I'm going to use ""mutation"" to refer collectively to any of these alterations. 

Everyone has mutations. Everyone. No one is ""perfect"", and cells replicate all the time, so errors will happen -- it just depends what the alteration is, where it happens, and when it happens -- that determines if it causes a disease, a risk factor, or absolutely nothing and no one cares. There is a HUGE spectrum. 

There are common mutations and rare mutations. Generally speaking, common mutations cause either absolutely no problems at all (those are called polymorphisms) or they cause a risk factor, which by itself doesn't do much but if there are other risk factors (genetic, lifestyle, environment, etc.), it can cause problems.  If common mutations did a ton of damage, there would be no more humans. 

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs or ""Snips"") fall into this category. SNPs are not mutations, in that they, by themselves, do not cause disease. A SNP may be correlated with a disease (""people with early onset heart disease seem to have this SNP more often than the average person""), but do not cause the disease (""he has a mutation in the *LDLR* gene causing Familial hypercholesterolemia and thus he has this disease""). Therefore trying to look at common or moderately common SNPs is really not that helpful for YOU. You and your doctor are probably not going to change your care much by finding out if you have some common to moderately common thing. However, it is helpful from a population/research perspective. The more we know the better and it can be helpful for learning about the genetics of various diseases, but you shouldn't rely on tests like [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/), which primarily look at the presence or absence of various SNPs, to find out why you have infertility or to help you decide what to do about it.

Rare mutations are much more likely to be disease-causing. They tend to be one mutation or change, in one gene or chromosome, that all by itself causes harm, and by ""causes harm"" I mean it can, for example, all by itself cause premature ovarian failure. For example: the *FMR1* gene, when mutated, causes Fragile X Syndrome in boys, but women who are carriers for the mutated form can have premature ovarian failure. That is a helpful answer as to why you have POF, in that it is a clear reason. It may not offer a solution, but it's an answer. 

One example I want to bring up because I get really concerned when it is mentioned on this (or any other) forum, is the *MTHFR* gene. A while back, there were studies with data suggesting that mutations in this gene could cause or contribute to clotting issues, and thus potentially impact miscarriage. However, further studies and massive review of all of the literature shows that changes in this gene are extremely common, and that they are one of many polymorphisms and are NOT disease causing all by itself or even in combination with one or two other things. At this point in time, there is not thought to be any real clinical impact from this gene, and thus no utility in testing for changes in this gene. Both the American College of Medical Genetics and American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology do not recommend testing for this, because most data right now says that it is useless and can even cause problems. If someone really does have a clotting issue, is identified with an *MTHFR* change, and we say ""Oh well we found it! This is why!"" and thus stop looking for the real cause, we could miss something really important if we ignore the data and get distracted by a de-bunked theory. If you are concerned about it, talk to someone in genetics in person and have them re-review the latest literature and talk to you about pros and cons.

This stuff is complicated. And there are a lot of companies out there happy to take your money and either tell you nothing or scare the crap out of you for no reason. Here are some things you can do to find information about a potential genetic cause of whatever you're experiencing: 

1.	Ask your reproductive endocrinologist: ""What causes this? Are there genetic causes? Is it something you can test for?"" MOST importantly: ""Would that information help you decide how to manage my care?""
2.	Go see a genetic counselor: Generally speaking, they're nice, well educated people who genuinely want to help. You get a 30 min to an hour-long appointment and they can talk about all of this stuff. You can find one near you here: https://www.nsgc.org/findageneticcounselor There are a few different Types of Specializations you may want to search by: Prenatal, ART, PGD/Preconception. But I would also consider just looking at Adult or some of the more general ones and calling to ask if there is anyone that can talk to you about your specific question.
Also, be wary of non-genetics professionals ordering genetic testing. There are some tests that are more straightforward and fine (karyotype or chromosome analysis), and certainly there are plenty of non-genetics doctors who know a lot about genetics and do a good job. BUT, one problem in the profession of genetic counselors is that we end up spending a lot of time cleaning up a mess made by doctors who don't know what they're doing ordering tests they shouldn't order, and not explaining to patients what the test means or the impact it may have. This is like, THE THING that genetic counselors talk about A LOT in private, what a huge problem this is or can be. So please please please, consider asking to talk to a genetic counselor if someone starts recommending genetic testing above and beyond basic chromosomes. 
3.	Consider participating in research: Look up a study or trial that may help you and or help you contribute to the larger knowledge base. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home 
4.	Get in the weeds: Proceed carefully here, you may seen genes come up that DO NOT apply to you.  This is a database of genetic conditions, the genes that cause them and the clinical tests that examine them. Again this is a tool for genetics professionals so don't let it overwhelm you or scare you to death. For example, I looked up POF and a bunch of cancer genes came up that I know don't actually apply to POF, they apply to ovarian cancer. So that's a limitation here. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/ 

OK that's what I have. I hope it's helpful. It's certainly not everything but I hope its a good basic overview.

Two surgeries and a round of radioactive iodine (RAI) later, I just got decent bloodwork - a TSH of 1 (for the first time in a year!) and a thyroglobulin (Tg) of 0.2. 

I have an appointment with my endo next week and I'm trying to prepare. Such a low Tg indicates no more RAI, but when should we get back into IF treatments? All studies say to wait between 6 and 12 mos after RAI to get pregnant, as residual radiation can destroy a fetus' thyroid and cause cognitive and developmental issues. That is a big risk with a HUGE time range! It'll be 6mos in March. Should we start trying then or wait another 6mos?  Thoughts?

Similarly, this is the first time that my TSH is at an appropriate level. It's gone down to 2.0 before, but bounced right back to 7 the next month. Should I ask for continued monthly monitoring before we start IF treatments again? Should I see consistently good TSH levels for (however many) months before we start? 

Thoughts? Has anyone else had this issue? How long did you want to get off the bench? Any other questions I should ask my endo next week?

This is my first time posting a question here, so I apologize if I break any rules. This subreddit has helped me tremendously and although it sucks to be here, its the best worst place to be. So thank you all for your endless support.

My flair explains most of it, but just to clarify on a few things and then my question. I started IVF in August 2017, got 7 embryos, had a fresh transfer immediately after, and then two frozen transfers (single embryos only) in Nov 2017 and then most recently on Jan 18 2018. I did not do PGS testing because when I asked about it, my RE said she typically does not recommend it below the age of 36.  After my first FET, my beta hcg was 65, two days later was 32. My RE said it was probably a chromosomal abnormality, so the embryo was eliminated. My husband and I both did genetic analysis (karyotypes) in January after the second failed transfer and they were normal. My Vit D was originally low and then rechecked in January was normal. So was my thyroid.

So, here I am. My RE was really optimistic at my first FET, which didn't work. Now I've had my second FET, no dice. My lining is fine, my hormones are fine, the embryo apparently ""looks"" good but certainly that doesn't mean anything. The plan this time is to now transfer two embryos because I've had three failed transfers. RE wants to repeat a sonohysterogram (had one two years ago which was normal) and endometrial ""scratching"" a week before I start my next FET. From what I have read, it seems to improve pregnancy rates, and the risks are minimal. I currently control my cycle with birth control, then use a combo of estrace, endometrin twice daily, PIO at night (lucky me!), baby aspirin, and prenatal vitamins of course. I'm assuming we will do a similar protocol this next time. 

My question is, what else should I be asking them to do? How can I be proactive? Sadly over the years, I have become very complacent and do what they suggest without asking because I feel so defeated. I asked before the last transfer about the ERA, my RE said she has only done it a few times for patients on request and that there are no studies showing it adds a benefit. Anything else? Is hysteroscopy beneficial? Via ultrasound, they have seen a 1 cm polyp, but other than that, nothing. 

If nobody has an answer, that is okay. Thank you for letting me vent and thank you for your suggestions.  

EDIT: thank you for your responses. It seems like a hysteroscopy would really make sense. Some of my test results are not currently available to me so I am going to ask the Doctor about the previous polyp they found. Thank you all so much.

I started IVF in August 2017, got 7 embryos, had a fresh transfer immediately after, and then two frozen transfers (single embryos only) in Nov 2017 and then most recently on Jan 18 2018. I did not do PGS testing because when I asked about it, my RE said she typically does not recommend it below the age of 36.  After my first FET, my beta hcg was 65, two days later was 32. My RE said it was probably a chromosomal abnormality, so the embryo was eliminated. My husband and I both did genetic analysis (karyotypes) in January after the second failed transfer and they were normal. My Vit D was originally low and then rechecked in January was normal. So was my thyroid.</p>

<p>So, here I am. My RE was really optimistic at my first FET, which didn&#39;t work. Now I&#39;ve had my second FET, no dice. My lining is fine, my hormones are fine, the embryo apparently &quot;looks&quot; good but certainly that doesn&#39;t mean anything. The plan this time is to now transfer two embryos because I&#39;ve had three failed transfers. RE wants to repeat a sonohysterogram (had one two years ago which was normal) and endometrial &quot;scratching&quot; a week before I start my next FET. From what I have read, it seems to improve pregnancy rates, and the risks are minimal. I currently control my cycle with birth control, then use a combo of estrace, endometrin twice daily, PIO at night (lucky me!), baby aspirin, and prenatal vitamins of course. I&#39;m assuming we will do a similar protocol this next time. </p>

<p>My question is, what else should I be asking them to do? How can I be proactive? Sadly over the years, I have become very complacent and do what they suggest without asking because I feel so defeated. I asked before the last transfer about the ERA, my RE said she has only done it a few times for patients on request and that there are no studies showing it adds a benefit. Anything else? Is hysteroscopy beneficial? Via ultrasound, they have seen a 1 cm polyp, but other than that, nothing. </p>

<p>If nobody has an answer, that is okay. Thank you for letting me vent and thank you for your suggestions.  </p>

<p>EDIT: thank you for your responses. It seems like a hysteroscopy would really make sense. Some of my test results are not currently available to me so I am going to ask the Doctor about the previous polyp they found. Thank you all so much. </p>

**Endometrin**

* 1 box contains 21 doses @ 3/day = 7 days/box

* 1 box = $184. 1 day = $26.29

* The suppositories are a white tab that is inserted vaginally (or rectally if allowed) using an applicator. After application, you are supposed to sit or lay down for 5-10 minutes. 

* The tablet dissolves and leaves a chalky substance in your vagina. I had **excessive** discharge while on Endometrin. Panty liners were an absolute must 100% of the time. Before I knew how bad the discharge would be, I literally soaked through my underwear when I rolled over in the middle of the night. I thought I had peed myself. 

* Using flushable, unscented wipes regularly helped to keep everything from getting too irritated.

**Crinone**

* 1 box contains 18 doses @ 2/day = 9 days/box

* 1 box = $254. 1 day = $28.22

* Crinone isn't really a suppository in that it's an applicator filled with gel. The applicator is inserted in the vagina and then a small box at the bottom is squeezed to force the gel out and place it high in the vagina. You do not have to sit or lay down after using.

* The progesterone is absorbed by through the mucous lining and the binding is left. I've seen the texture described as paper m√¢ch√©, cottage cheese, or dried white glue. Every couple days, a manual vagina sweep with your finger to remove the binder will help reduce the discharge. I only had to wear a panty liner one day and that was transfer due to the fluid leaking out used to clean the cervix. Some people report no discharge even *without sweeping*.

* I haven't had to use the wipes with Crinone. The second day of Crinone was really uncomfortable for me. My vagina wasn't used to the drying gel and it was irritated. It went away after a day or 2.

**Conclusion**

#Crinonewins

For me, it's 100% worth it to pay the extra $2 a day and not feel like I'm peeing yourself constantly. The irritation is also significantly less. I can do my morning and evening application at home. Not having to worry about the third dose at work is also a huge plus for me.

Edit: After 11 days of crinone, the clumps of paper m√¢ch√© are now super dark brown or even black. Everything I've read said this is normal. It was pretty off putting at first. Crinone has something in the gel to make it bind to the vaginal wall membranes which makes everything pretty sensitive and irritated down there. Spotting is also totally normal.

<li><p>1 box contains 18 doses @ 2/day = 9 days/box</p></li>
<li><p>1 box = $254. 1 day = $28.22</p></li>
<li><p>Crinone isn&#39;t really a suppository in that it&#39;s an applicator filled with gel. The applicator is inserted in the vagina and then a small box at the bottom is squeezed to force the gel out and place it high in the vagina. You do not have to sit or lay down after using.</p></li>
<li><p>The progesterone is absorbed by through the mucous lining and the binding is left. I&#39;ve seen the texture described as paper m√¢ch√©, cottage cheese, or dried white glue. Every couple days, a manual vagina sweep with your finger to remove the binder will help reduce the discharge. I only had to wear a panty liner one day and that was transfer due to the fluid leaking out used to clean the cervix. Some people report no discharge even <em>without sweeping</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven&#39;t had to use the wipes with Crinone. The second day of Crinone was really uncomfortable for me. My vagina wasn&#39;t used to the drying gel and it was irritated. It went away after a day or 2.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<h1>Crinonewins</h1>

<p>For me, it&#39;s 100% worth it to pay the extra $2 a day and not feel like I&#39;m peeing yourself constantly. The irritation is also significantly less. I can do my morning and evening application at home. Not having to worry about the third dose at work is also a huge plus for me.</p>

<p>Edit: After 11 days of crinone, the clumps of paper m√¢ch√© are now super dark brown or even black. Everything I&#39;ve read said this is normal. It was pretty off putting at first. Crinone has something in the gel to make it bind to the vaginal wall membranes which makes everything pretty sensitive and irritated down there. Spotting is also totally normal. I also had to start wearing a panty liner after 5 days as the discharge really ramped up.</p>

I finally had the HSG yesterday and the results aren't clear cut. I'm hoping the collective wisdom and experience of this group can help me decide what to do. 

I spoke with my RE this morning about the results. My left tube is fine, but the radiologist and my RE disagree about whether there's an issue with the right tube.  The radiologist's assessment is that the right tube is fine. My RE thinks that its *probably* fine but told me this morning that he still would 60% recommend getting a laparoscopy to be sure. He then proceeded to tell me how the HSG test isn't always accurate, and he had a patient recently where all three reviewers of her HSG thought it looked normal, but then after another failed FET she had a laparoscopy which showed that there was an infection after all, and once fixed she was able to get pregnant. A nice story, but not super helpful to hear that the HSG test I just waited 4 months to have is essentially useless as a diagnostic tool for my situation. 

Anyway, my RE is leaving it up to me about whether I want to try another FET and see if it works, knowing that there's a question mark about whether there's an issue with my right tube that could lead to implantation failure. Or, if I want to go ahead and do a laparoscopy to find out for sure and fix any issue present. 

I'm torn because of course I want answers to why i'm still childless. But, I also don't want to undergo a major surgery unless its totally necessary. Those of you who know my history know that i've put my body through a lot of shit over the past 5 years (2IVFs, bad OHSS, ectopic/methotrexate, 2 D&C) and i'm wondering when enough is enough. Can my reproductive parts really take another surgical intrusion? 

Part of me wants to skip the lap and do another FET (we have 3 PGS normal embryos on ice), but the other part of me thinks ""what if i'm making a mistake and will be devastated if the FET fails and I could have prevented it?"" 

I know the decision is ultimately up to me and my SO, but if any of you have dealt with a similar decision i'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm so freaking tired of trying for a baby and having to think about decisions like this...
