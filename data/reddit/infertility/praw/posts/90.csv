Also, sorry in advance, it’s a long post.

**History so you don’t have to dig through my post history:**

I (F26) and my partner (M26) have been officially trying since January 2018. We did 12 months of trying naturally before seeing a specialist in January 2019. In that 12 months we had a few chemical pregnancies (3 confirmed with bHCG but a period arriving a few days later).

All bloods (thyroid, blood count, rubella, etc.) and an SA were completed showing we were both great! Bloods and ultrasound show I ovulated every cycle (albeit late) with an LP of 12 days.

January 2019 we started OI (2.5mg Letrozole in days 2-6) with Timed Intercourse.
March 2019 I had a HyCoSy which showed patent tubes with a small uterine fibroid on the posterior (I think?) wall that was determined to be insignificant.
May 2019 I stopped responding as well to the Letrozole so we increased to 5mg on days 2-6.

August 2019 I had laparoscopic surgery, a D&C and Hysteroscopy which diagnosed endometriosis (Stage 3) and it was successfully excised.

I fell pregnant naturally in October 2019 which unfortunately resulted in an ectopic pregnancy (fortunately resolving itself over the space of a week).
I fell pregnant on another OI (5mg Letrozole) with TI cycle in December 2019 and had a PUL which ended in early Jan 2020.

Last cycle (Feb 2020) I stopped responding to the Letrozole so we did a rescue cycle with increased Letrozole (7.5mg days 2-6) and Progesterone pessaries after ovulation until bloods yesterday (CD 29) confirmed no bHCG. I have since started spotting so my period is on its’ way.

I am expecting to receive my RPL results today at an appointment (hence the question).
We will also be discussing treatment for my endometriosis as my symptoms are returning and are *very* unpleasant.

**My question:**
I am seeing my specialist today. We are going to be discussing my next treatment steps.
Given my history, and pending the “all clear” from my RPL, would you go straight to IVF or would you try IUI first?
She has already said the choice is mine to make.
FWIW - we have private health, and cost is fortunately not an issue for us. We are tired of the mind fuck that is infertility and just want to start our family.

March 2019 I had a HyCoSy which showed patent tubes with a small uterine fibroid on the posterior (I think?) wall that was determined to be insignificant.
May 2019 I stopped responding as well to the Letrozole so we increased to 5mg on days 2-6.</p>

<p>August 2019 I had laparoscopic surgery, a D&amp;C and Hysteroscopy which diagnosed endometriosis (Stage 3) and it was successfully excised.</p>

<p>I fell pregnant naturally in October 2019 which unfortunately resulted in an ectopic pregnancy (fortunately resolving itself over the space of a week).
I fell pregnant on another OI (5mg Letrozole) with TI cycle in December 2019 and had a PUL which ended in early Jan 2020.</p>

<p>Last cycle (Feb 2020) I stopped responding to the Letrozole so we did a rescue cycle with increased Letrozole (7.5mg days 2-6) and Progesterone pessaries after ovulation until bloods yesterday (CD 29) confirmed no bHCG. I have since started spotting so my period is on its’ way.</p>

<p>I am expecting to receive my RPL results today at an appointment (hence the question).
We will also be discussing treatment for my endometriosis as my symptoms are returning and are <em>very</em> unpleasant.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong>
I am seeing my specialist today. We are going to be discussing my next treatment steps.
Given my history, and pending the “all clear” from my RPL, would you go straight to IVF or would you try IUI first?
She has already said the choice is mine to make.
FWIW - we have private health, and cost is fortunately not an issue for us. We are tired of the mind fuck that is infertility and just want to start our family.</p>

Hi all,

This sub has been an amazing support for me for years, so its time to pay it forward and donate some meds I've been hoarding and won't be using. I had just stocked up for another retrieval and transfer, so I have quite a bit to give away.

**Preference will be given to anyone local (Connecticut area) as well as those paying out of pocket.** These were all purchased myself since I have no infertility coverage (though a few were kind donations from others here), so hoping to pass off to someone in a similar situation. If I can't find anyone local, I may try to ship, particularly for the items that do not require refrigeration. I may ask you to cover the shipping cost, due to the large amount of meds, which is going to add up for me in shipping fees. Please send me a message, NOT a chat (I don't receive those on my phone). Please only ask for what you need!

Here is what I have (everything is unopened, has been kept refrigerated as needed, etc.):

* ~~Cetrotide: Two 0.25mg packages - Both expire in August 2020~~
* ~~Gonal:~~
   * ~~Seven 300IU pens - Six expire in September 2020, one expires in May 2020~~
   * ~~Two 900IU pens - Both expire in May 2020~~
* ~~Follistim: One 600IU vial - Expires in September 2020~~
* ~~Menopur:~~
   * ~~Four sealed boxes with 5 vials per box - Two boxes expire in September 2020, two boxes expire in November 2020~~
   * ~~One opened box with 4 vials remaining - Expire in March 2020~~
* ~~Omnitrope: Three vials - Two expire in December 2020, one expires in June 2020~~
* ~~Ganirelix: Six syringes - All expire in April 2020~~
* ~~Endometrin: Two full boxes (21 inserts each) + 18 additional inserts - All expire in December 2020~~
* ~~Estradiol pills: Not sure how many (a lot) - Expire in September 2020~~
* ~~Lovenox: Around 11 boxes total 40mg - Most expiration dates into 2021~~

I also have plenty of QCaps to include, and just about every type of syringe and needle you can imagine. So, please let me know if you need any of those as well.

Please be patient with me for responses, as I'm sure I'm going to be inundated with responses to this. Like I said, preference will be given to those that can do local pickup (Connecticut), are out of pocket, and first to respond.

Looking for some advice. I've done three monitored cycles with TI + letrozole. I'm meeting my doctor on Tuesday and will be asking to change my care plan. Originally we were going to do 6 medicated cycles which would have been Nov- May. We've managed to only do three since November. I chose not to do anything medically this cycle as my letrozole dose should have been bumped up in December after the second medicated cycle, but the clinic didn't schedule a follow-up appointment until January for March...and here we are, (thats another post for another day).

If I have the means to afford IVF, does doing a few cycles of IUI even make sense for us? They found nothing on any of my tests, everything came back in the normal range and my husbands blood-work and SA came back normal too. I am in my mid-thirties so I don't want to take another 3-6 months of exploring less effective treatments. IUI would be taking money & time away from our IVF treatment at this point. 

I'd love to hear thoughts/experiences/opinions from others who have been at this treatment plan crossroad to to speak.

Originally we were going to do 6 medicated cycles which would have been Nov- May. We&#39;ve managed to only do three since November. I chose not to do anything medically this cycle as my letrozole dose should have been bumped up in December after the second medicated cycle, but the clinic didn&#39;t schedule a follow-up appointment until January for March...and here we are, (thats another post for another day).</p>

<p>If I have the means to afford IVF, does doing a few cycles of IUI even make sense for us? They found nothing on any of my tests, everything came back in the normal range and my husbands blood-work and SA came back normal too. I am in my mid-thirties so I don&#39;t want to take another 3-6 months of exploring less effective treatments. IUI would be taking money &amp; time away from our IVF treatment at this point. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear thoughts/experiences/opinions from others who have been at this treatment plan crossroad to to speak. Thanks so much.</p>

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

I remember joining this group when my HSG showed very swollen tubes and my RE wanted me to have a laparoscopic surgery to look for fluids and possibly endometriosis. I remember reading a post about someone writing about their experience with lap surgery and I thought it was so helpful at the time. So here I am wanting to pay forward and share my experience in case others might find it useful. 

A little background: husband and I have been trying for 1.5 years before we decided to seek out a fertility consult back in January. All the bloodwork and SA were fine. The only problem was my swollen tubes and the large 5cm ovarian cyst. At this point my RE already told us we would need IVF because she thinks the tubes were very damaged. 

Fast forward: After several second opinions, which included a dismissive doctor and a rush doctor, I finally landed on an endo specialist, who completely understood my situation in wanting to maximize my fertility while fixing what is necessary. I’m so glad I did not settle on the others. This doctor spent 45 mins explaining every possible outcome and I felt so reassured.  

Really fast forward now: I had my surgery yesterday. I came at 10:30am for a surgery at 12:30pm. I was checked in promptly, did all the vitals and history screening. Nurse put in an IV line. I met with my doctor again to go over the game plan, met with the anesthesiologist, OR tech and others. Everyone was really friendly! I was given a couple of pain and anti nausea meds to be ahead of the pain and nausea later. I remember getting settled in the OR bed then next thing I knew I was being wheeled out to the recovery room. I remember hearing someone said “no endo.” My surgery took 3.5 hours and I was out of anesthesia probably another 1.5 hr later. At this time my doctor briefed my husband about the results. While in recovery, I felt pain so the nurse gave me another oxycodone which brought down the pain considerably. I felt the urge to urinate but really didn’t need to. The nurse told me this is normal. I did not have any nausea. I met up with my husband later and was given all the post op info. I cannot shower until 2 days later. The incisions (I had 4) were glued and the stitches were dissolvable. My husband already picked up the meds for me. In the end, I did not have endo. My tubes had a lot of scar tissues that was all the way up to my kidneys. I suspected this is due to my kidney/bladder infections when I was little. The tubes were no good so she removed my tubes. The cyst was successfully removed too.

Day 1 post op - I feel a lot better today. I don’t have any nausea and no gas pain. I was really worried about that. I’m taking high dose Tylenol and ibuprofen for pain and it seems to be working. I was also prescribed an antibiotic in case of an infection because of the tubes removal. Some bleeding when I use the bathroom but was told that is normal. Husband is home to help me move around.

I don't want this post to discourage you from watching this show, because it's one of the best comedies on the air right now. However, if you are watching, and haven't started the newest season, I wanted to offer a warning regarding one of the subplots. Spoilers ahead...

Jake and Amy, recently married, have a pregnancy scare early on in the season, which kick-starts their efforts in TTC, both of them believing it to be ""easy."" Honestly, I thought the show would give 'em what they wanted right away, and was a bit peeved by that notion. In this week's episode (3/5), however, they realize it may not be as easy as they once thought. Amy, the ever-planner she is, starts charting, restricting their diets, forces supplements, etc... As someone who has done this, their accuracy, again, pissed me off. She was taking her temp at random times during the day—what?! That's such an easy step to get right! Why get it wrong? Up until this point, we're in TW territory. 

But then, it took a turn. She wasn't getting pregnant and started saying the EXACT things I'm sure all of us have said. We're doing everything right! Why isn't it happening for us? How does anyone manage to get pregnant? Etc... I was SO thankful Amy was putting into words how I felt, and that in a platform my husband understands. You have no idea how many times I yelled ""thank YOU"" to the screen. It was great.

Then the fear arose... They kept trying unique ways to get pregnant, and all I could think was *shit. She's going to be magically pregnant by the end of this episode*. Thankfully, she wasn't. Jake even mentioned if it didn't work naturally, they could talk about IVF and adoptions (as if it's that easy...), but I appreciated the acknowledgement that there are other ways to grow a family. Representation!

I'm really hoping they go the IVF route, and show it authentically. So many people don't know what IVF is like, how it affects a person and marriage, etc... This would be great! Granted, an adoption route would be great, too. I'm just terrified the writers are going to ignore the struggles altogether and she'll be magically pregnant by the end of the season. That seems likely, though I wish it weren't.

<p>I don&#39;t want this post to discourage you from watching this show, because it&#39;s one of the best comedies on the air right now. However, if you are watching, and haven&#39;t started the newest season, I wanted to offer a warning regarding one of the subplots. Spoilers ahead...</p>

<p>Jake and Amy, recently married, have a pregnancy scare early on in the season, which kick-starts their efforts in TTC, both of them believing it to be &quot;easy.&quot; Honestly, I thought the show would give &#39;em what they wanted right away, and was a bit peeved by that notion. In this week&#39;s episode (3/5), however, they realize it may not be as easy as they once thought. Amy, the ever-planner she is, starts charting, restricting their diets, forces supplements, etc... As someone who has done this, their accuracy, again, pissed me off. She was taking her temp at random times during the day—what?! That&#39;s such an easy step to get right! Why get it wrong? Up until this point, we&#39;re in TW territory. </p>

<p>But then, it took a turn. She wasn&#39;t getting pregnant and started saying the EXACT things I&#39;m sure all of us have said. We&#39;re doing everything right! Why isn&#39;t it happening for us? How does anyone manage to get pregnant? Etc... I was SO thankful Amy was putting into words how I felt, and that in a platform my husband understands. You have no idea how many times I yelled &quot;thank YOU&quot; to the screen. It was great.</p>

<p>Then the fear arose... They kept trying unique ways to get pregnant, and all I could think was <em>shit. She&#39;s going to be magically pregnant by the end of this episode</em>. Thankfully, she wasn&#39;t. Jake even mentioned if it didn&#39;t work naturally, they could talk about IVF and adoptions (as if it&#39;s that easy...), but I appreciated the acknowledgement that there are other ways to grow a family. Representation!</p>

<p>I&#39;m really hoping they go the IVF route, and show it authentically. So many people don&#39;t know what IVF is like, how it affects a person and marriage, etc... This would be great! Granted, an adoption route would be great, too. I&#39;m just terrified the writers are going to ignore the struggles altogether and she&#39;ll be magically pregnant by the end of the season. That seems likely, though I wish it weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>ANYWHO, this became a ramble/rant, but I wanted to make sure you wonderful people know what you&#39;re getting into with this season. It&#39;s a great show, but I&#39;ve rolled my eyes and groaned A LOT whil watching.</p>

I want to preface this by saying that I am by no means a frequent or talented writer, so this is a bit out of the norm for me. However, I have seen some things written by other members of this sub that have really spoken to me over the last few years and I wanted to share this with you. What initially started as something short that came to me in the shower this morning turned into something longer that I just needed to get out once I sat down and started typing. My husband and I did our last transfer on 3/3, with the 2 embryos we got from our 3rd stim cycle. After this, we are done with treatment. I have come to terms that we will be moving on but it's been a long, difficult transition period and I'm sure the coming months will be challenging. Below I detail our last transfer day and some of the emotions and heaviness that went with it. Thanks for reading.

**Our Last Transfer**

Ushered into a room,  
dimly lit, spa like,   
just like the rest of this clinic.  
As if it’s supposed to make us feel better,  
more “relaxed”.  
Undress from the waist down,  
I know the drill.  
Our nurse remembers us from all our visits  
over the course of the last year and a half.  
“What are we going to do with you?!” She jokes  
“I’m going to give these embryos a talking to.”  
She draws my blood for what seems to be  
the millionth time, scar tissue creating a barricade  
between the needle and my veins.  
She leaves us to wait for embryology and we sit  
in silence.

Embryology knocks on the door,  
shows us our last two embryos.  
“Do they look ok?” I ask, even though  
it doesn’t really matter.  
“They look great, they thawed beautifully.”  
she tells me. As if they would ever admit to a patient  
if they didn’t.  
She leaves us to wait for the doctor and we sit  
in silence.

The doctor comes in, greets us.  
I lie back on the table, knees up, exposed  
“Your uterus is in an odd position, this might hurt”  
A 90 degree angle between uterus and cervix  
is hardly conducive for easy catheter placement.  
Pain washes over me,  
tears well up in my eyes as my husband squeezes my hand  
and the nurse pats my shoulder.  
As the doctor fights my body, we all hold our breath  
in silence.

Finally, the embryos are able to be inserted.  
The doctor stands, I sit up.  
He reviews my chart, “How many transfers is this now?”  
Six. “And no success at all yet?”  
None.  
“Have you tried…?” he asks, as he lists off different  
medications, protocols, add-ons.  
Yes, yes, yep, uh huh, yes, yep.  
“She’s tried it all, doc” our nurse says.  
He purses his lips, turns back to us  
takes our hands and leaves us with a  
“Good luck and god bless”  
I don’t tell him that I don’t believe in god  
anymore, especially after all of this.  
The nurse leaves and we just sit  
in silence.

I scramble for my clothes, suddenly overwhelmed  
with emotion, the sheer weight   
of what just happened:  
Our Last Transfer, The End.  
My husband stops me, tries to get my eyes  
to meet his, but I look away because I know  
I won’t be able to hold it together.  
We blink back tears, embrace.  
I dress, and we walk out hand in hand  
in silence.",t2_yc2oc,False,,0,False,Our Last Transfer -- A Poem,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_fdy8nh,False,dark,0.97,,public,110,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,110,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1583456422.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all.

Met with the RE yesterday and he gave us 2 options. 

#1
Higher dose of Letrozole + monitoring (ultrasound) + more Letrozole if first ultrasound doesn’t show a dominant follicle + another ultrasound to check follicles again + trigger + timed intercourse. We could add IUI to this option instead of timed intercourse but sperm is not the issue. 

Repeat 4 times and if not successful proceed to option #2. He said the success rate for each cycle is approximately 10% which is compounded the longer you try, up to 4 cycles.

#2
IVF - we can start this as soon as I start my next cycle (in the next 2-3 weeks)

I had to cough twice and I think she pushed something then she used a &quot;sharp instrument&quot; and I felt a very sharp cut/jab which gave me a fright. Afterwards, she was able to pass the catheter and inject the dye.</p>

<p>It was quite painful but the team were excellent. Tubes and womb looked clear after dye, which is great, and there was evidence I was just about to ovulate but now wondering if I have Ashermans and whether scarring had been the main issue with our fertility issues over the past 18+ months. Anyone else have this experience?</p>

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for approx 4 years, I’m 32 and he’s almost 40. 
We’ve had two early term miscarriages with the most recent being May last year. We’ve been to a number of different specialists, completed what feels like a myriad of tests to be told “sometimes 10% of couples can’t conceive and we don’t know why.” 
The first time we fell pregnant was after a year of trying with no medication, the second was on the second round of Clomid. We’re tried Letrozole about 2 years ago for 3 months with no results. We’ve tried Clomid for 6 months with 1 short term pregnancy but the last round of that was about 5 months ago.
I’ve been told I have PCOS, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and that my weight is the reason we’re not pregnant (just to have all of those medical reasons taken back the next time I visit with new test results). My test results have never been drastic; a blood test once showed a 0.01 increase in my testosterone so the doctor said I had PCOS, my next test showed normal results and has shown normal results since. My husband’s tests are all coming back positive as well despite a Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis 6 years ago (the doctor was glowing about his “18 year old sperm” last month which my husband couldn’t help but glow about.)
I’ve lost almost 10kgs in the last 3 months (my husband has lost considerable weight too) and the fertility specialist we’re seeing now said my last test results came back with interesting thyroid levels so hypothyroidism is back in the table apparently. I’ve had the test that they do to inject dye through your cervix to check for blockages (which, hello, hurt a lot) and they decided that since that test came back positive they want to try Clomid again.
So here we go again, my period started today and I’m back on Clomid. The doctor wants to try it for 2 more months, then we try artificial insemination if this doesn’t work. The doctor did say that we will be including injections to help “release eggs” but we didn’t have much time to discuss that, does anybody have any experience with those or know what they might entail?
Thank you for your time, I hope everyone’s journey here ends in a positive way.

The doctor did say that we will be including injections to help “release eggs” but we didn’t have much time to discuss that, does anybody have any experience with those or know what they might entail?
Thank you for your time, I hope everyone’s journey here ends in a positive way. It seems like for the past four years everyone I know is pregnant or having their baby (or two, or three by now) so it’s nice to be able to talk about this without looks of pity and “you’ll get there soon!” vibes with people who understand.</p>

So I have the info for my first IVM cycle, for all future people planning IVM or anyone interested. IVM is the plan to mature most or all of the eggs in vitro instead of in vivo. It reduces hormone exposure which is beneficial for women like me with PCOS and high risk of OHSS. It is also super helpful in women with hormone sensitive cancers, as well as women who need cancer therapy as soon as possible, as the priming and down-regulation phases are all but non-existent. In fact, a [news article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/europe/france-ivm-cancer-baby-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html) about the first IVM baby born to a woman with a hormone sensitive cancer just came out this month! She had only three weeks in between resection and chemo for fertility planning. That baby was actually frozen as a mature oocyte when the woman was 29 then thawed and fertilized 5 years later.

Things I learned about IVM:

1. The stimming and monitoring is a lot like an IUI cycle. For me that means you're ready aout CD20 because your body takes forever to do anything, and you do every other or daily labs/US. It also feels about the same in terms of belly fullness/discomfort
2. My husband had to go daily for 3 days to give fresh samples.
3. 2/26 was a rough day, I had such hope for at least a few of those 15. I'm not sure if their delayed maturation is a sign of bad quality or just a fluke. Because even the second round of maturing eggs didn't do so well either. I will be asking.
4. Re-affirms my faith in IVF. In my head (I don't know if this can literally be supported) I feel like I could have gotten pregnant 32 times with IVF and would have had 29 failures or losses. It was enough of a struggle to get me to sometimes ovulate with IVF, but my eggs are bad quality and probably chromosomally abnormal too. So I say let's get the good ones sorted out. 90% were ultimately non-viable.
5. I will probably do 2-3 more cycles to bank enough eggs hopefully.
6. IVM really sounds easier on the body that IVF. There is a lot of monitoring but that's a small price to pay. And speaking of which, it is cheaper because you're not using gonal or follistim. I don't know how much additional lab costs there are to mature, but isn't the main cost of IVF the meds? What I'm saying is, I wonder if there is a place for IVF in the rest of the community, some day, not just the people I listed above?

If you made it this far, congrats!

ETA 3/9 PGS results are back. The two day 1 embryos are normal 46! The day 7 we sent from the second day was 44, -18, -19. 
We are preparing for our second retrieval at the end of the month.

ETA: I got the fees, since we’re paying out of pocket for the next cycle. This was mostly covered by insurance the first round, but we can’t do another retrieval if we have any embryos on ice, thanks aetna. There is a small discount in some categories since we’re out of pocket, and this does not include meds. I’m waiting to see how much the meds cost. 
1. IVF/ICSI (including monitoring, labs, us, retrieval, anesthesia): $13,480
2. Cryo preservation: $1,490
3. PGT biopsy per cycle: $1,800
4. PGT-A for up to 5 embryos ($300 for each additional after five): $2,200
5. Assisted hatching: $300

<p>Total sent for PGS: 3</p>

<p>Things I learned about IVM:</p>

<ol>
<li>The stimming and monitoring is a lot like an IUI cycle. For me that means you&#39;re ready aout CD20 because your body takes forever to do anything, and you do every other or daily labs/US. It also feels about the same in terms of belly fullness/discomfort</li>
<li>My husband had to go daily for 3 days to give fresh samples.</li>
<li>2/26 was a rough day, I had such hope for at least a few of those 15. I&#39;m not sure if their delayed maturation is a sign of bad quality or just a fluke. Because even the second round of maturing eggs didn&#39;t do so well either. I will be asking.</li>
<li>Re-affirms my faith in IVF. In my head (I don&#39;t know if this can literally be supported) I feel like I could have gotten pregnant 32 times with IVF and would have had 29 failures or losses. It was enough of a struggle to get me to sometimes ovulate with IVF, but my eggs are bad quality and probably chromosomally abnormal too. So I say let&#39;s get the good ones sorted out. 90% were ultimately non-viable.</li>
<li>I will probably do 2-3 more cycles to bank enough eggs hopefully.</li>
<li>IVM really sounds easier on the body that IVF. There is a lot of monitoring but that&#39;s a small price to pay. And speaking of which, it is cheaper because you&#39;re not using gonal or follistim. I don&#39;t know how much additional lab costs there are to mature, but isn&#39;t the main cost of IVF the meds? What I&#39;m saying is, I wonder if there is a place for IVF in the rest of the community, some day, not just the people I listed above?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you made it this far, congrats!</p>

<p>ETA 3/9 PGS results are back. The two day 1 embryos are normal 46! The day 7 we sent from the second day was 44, -18, -19. 
We are preparing for our second retrieval at the end of the month.</p>

<p>ETA: I got the fees, since we’re paying out of pocket for the next cycle. This was mostly covered by insurance the first round, but we can’t do another retrieval if we have any embryos on ice, thanks aetna. There is a small discount in some categories since we’re out of pocket, and this does not include meds. I’m waiting to see how much the meds cost. 
1. IVF/ICSI (including monitoring, labs, us, retrieval, anesthesia): $13,480
2. Cryo preservation: $1,490
3. PGT biopsy per cycle: $1,800
4. PGT-A for up to 5 embryos ($300 for each additional after five): $2,200
5. Assisted hatching: $300
Total: $19,270</p>

135,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi guys,

I thought I’d make a separate post about my slightly different medications for my second IVF cycle. We’ve just started it so no results to share yet, but the info might still be interesting to some. This is going to be long, so I tried to format it in a scannable way, and FYI I’m located in Scandinavia. I gathered more information about the meds that aren’t that common on the sub, and less so on common ones.

Always do your own research! I’m not a scientist, and go by “that heading looks interesting (and maybe someone has actually cited the research)” in my google scholar searches. And I for sure am not able to be neutral in this - my eyes seek articles that reinforce the “this will be the cycle that works” mentality, even if I try to be aware of my biases.

Keywords: endo, low AMH, DOR.

**TL;DR MEDS SUMMARY** and order of meds: 
Iron transfusion, 
Progynova 2 mg - 2*daily, for about a week for estrogen priming (<- we’re here currently)
Letrozol 2,5 mg - 2*daily for 5 days
Elonva  - (similar to gonal F but you only inject once), -> Ultrasound after 4 days. Possibly adding more hormones, depending on how the ultrasound looks.
Orgalutran -  after ultrasound to prevent ovulation
Ovitrelle 250 + Gonapeptyl 0,1 mg - to trigger
Terolut (similar to progesterone support but different hormone; taken orally)

  
  
**MY BACKGROUND**
Summary: 31 years old, extensive endo, DOR due to endo surgery. Only low AMH, vitamin D and ferritin have been tested (no idea of FHS, no one has ever been even interested in it).

Endo surgery - removal of 1 endometrioma from each ovary in 2015. Still have rectovaginal endo, and spots on my diaphragm. Continuous birth control for the next 4 years, until we decided to start trying on 03/2019. AMH taken a few times after that - 0.35. Weight normal. Have hypothyroidism, has been under control for 10 years now. Spontaneous chemical pregnancy in 05/2019. 
  
  

**PREV CYCLE:**

Synarel - to shut down ovaries, about 2 weeks. 

Gonal F - 300 IU (about 10 days), continue also with Synarel but with smaller dose. 

Ovitrelle - 250, 

Lugesterone - 200mg, period pushed through near the end of the 2WW. 

RESULT: 1 mature follice - 1 fresh transfer (failed). Public sector said ok thanks bye, and off we went to the private sector. Only one blood test and one ultrasound early on after starting the Gonal F, so that was definitely different from what I’ve seen here. 

  
****
****
  
  
**THIS CYCLE:**
The doctor thought that we should go a completely different route, and I agreed. No shutting down endo and ovaries, and other types of meds, too. I think this is quite similar to dr Sher’s DOR approach drgeoffreysherivf.com/ivf-diminished-ovarian-reserve/ . I was visiting the doctor on my CD 2 (after the failed 1st transfer), and she said that while my leftie looks pretty much done for (maybe 1-2 follicles), the right one is more active than my AMH would suggest (6-8 follicles). She said she should be able to get more than just 1 mature from that.
  
  
**IRON TRANSFUSION**
I’d had my ferritin levels checked before, and while my hemoglobin was good, 136, my ferritin was low, it’s been around 20-22. I think this clinic is the only one that does intravenous iron transfers for fertility around here. This happened last week. I had an odd taste in my mouth for a bit, but I think I actually feel better. No more weird-ish heart sensations and getting out of breath (I’m in good health with no reason to suspect any heart issues). Our doctor has stated openly herself that there is not much information in literature, but more so on discussion level and from changing experiences. 

Two (my freely translated) anecdotes she tells about is that 1) it is well-known that anemia is problematic for fertility, and 2) in the “nurses health study” those nurses who supplemented with iron had less e.g. ovulation disturbances. The clinic has also seen surprisingly good results with especially unexplained fertility couples who have had multiple treatments. 

****
  
  
**PROGYNOVA**
Well, it’s estrogen priming. It’s pretty standard and the med (progynova) had results when I searched for it, so just this for an article:

“Moreover, patients treated with luteal estrogen resulted in an increased number of oocytes retrieved” link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-011-9685-7

****
  
  
**ELONVA**
Elonva consists of corifollitropin alfa drugs.com/uk/elonva.html . Since I’m a DORer, I’m looking for more oocytes, and don’t have to worry as much about OHSS (I think). In my first cycle there were three “possible” follicles, but only two retrieved and one mature. The hope is that Elonva will help my eggs grow in a more consistent manner and we’ll have more in the retrieval.

“The mean ± SD number of oocytes retrieved per started cycle was 13.3 ± 7.3 for corifollitropin alfa versus 10.6 ± 5.9 for rFSH” sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1472648310001707

“There was evidence of increased ovarian response and risk of OHSS in corifollitropin alfa.” sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028212001215

One of the upsides of it, is that it raises your hormone levels quicker and they stay higher longer -> you don’t need to stick your self with a needle daily. slideshare.net/UARM/corifollitropin-alfa-elonva-clinical-trial-experience (See slide 5).

****
  
  
**ORGALUTRAN**
To stop ovaries from ovulating. This brand name isn’t as common but there were still a good number of hits when searching for info on the sub.

****
  
  
**OVITRELLE and GONAPEPTYL**
Double trigger this time. There’s information on this on the sub also, but here’s some things I found interesting anyways:

“Patients who received the double trigger (study group) had a significantly higher number of mature oocytes – MII (6.5 versus 3.6 p < 0.008), number of embryos transferred (2.4 versus 1.1 p < 0.03), a significantly higher proportions of MII oocytes per number of oocytes retrieved (69.7% versus 47.1% p < 0.03) and a higher number of top quality embryos (3.1 versus 1 p < 0.02), as compared to their previous control cycles (hCG-only trigger)” tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09513590.2014.978850

“The use of the ‘‘double trigger” has been successfully offered in the treatment of empty follicle syndrome and in patients with a history of immature oocytes retrieved or with low/poor oocytes yield” tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09513590.2016.1193141

****
  
  
**TEROLUT**
Terolut is made of dydrogesteron, and it’s taken orally, yay! 

“The on-going pregnancy rates were comparable between Crinone 8%® vaginal progesterone gel and oral dydrogesterone – Duphaston® (28.1% versus 30.3%; OR 1.11 (0.82–1.49 with 95% CI)). Overall satisfaction and tolerability were significantly higher in the dydrogesterone group” sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211514005855

“Although all the predictive and confounding factors could not be controlled for, the results of this systematic review show a significant reduction of 47% in the odds for miscarriage when dydrogesterone is compared to standard care indicating a real treatment effect.” tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09513590.2012.702875

“Clinical pregnancy rate in cyclogest group was higher than dydrogesterone group but the difference was not significant (p=0.52), furthermore the miscarriage rate in two group was the same “ ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941387/

<p>Lugesterone - 200mg, period pushed through near the end of the 2WW. </p>

<p>RESULT: 1 mature follice - 1 fresh transfer (failed). Public sector said ok thanks bye, and off we went to the private sector. Only one blood test and one ultrasound early on after starting the Gonal F, so that was definitely different from what I’ve seen here. </p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THIS CYCLE:</strong>
The doctor thought that we should go a completely different route, and I agreed. No shutting down endo and ovaries, and other types of meds, too. I think this is quite similar to dr Sher’s DOR approach drgeoffreysherivf.com/ivf-diminished-ovarian-reserve/ . I was visiting the doctor on my CD 2 (after the failed 1st transfer), and she said that while my leftie looks pretty much done for (maybe 1-2 follicles), the right one is more active than my AMH would suggest (6-8 follicles). She said she should be able to get more than just 1 mature from that.</p>

<p><strong>IRON TRANSFUSION</strong>
I’d had my ferritin levels checked before, and while my hemoglobin was good, 136, my ferritin was low, it’s been around 20-22. I think this clinic is the only one that does intravenous iron transfers for fertility around here. This happened last week. I had an odd taste in my mouth for a bit, but I think I actually feel better. No more weird-ish heart sensations and getting out of breath (I’m in good health with no reason to suspect any heart issues). Our doctor has stated openly herself that there is not much information in literature, but more so on discussion level and from changing experiences. </p>

<p>Two (my freely translated) anecdotes she tells about is that 1) it is well-known that anemia is problematic for fertility, and 2) in the “nurses health study” those nurses who supplemented with iron had less e.g. ovulation disturbances. The clinic has also seen surprisingly good results with especially unexplained fertility couples who have had multiple treatments. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>PROGYNOVA</strong>
Well, it’s estrogen priming. It’s pretty standard and the med (progynova) had results when I searched for it, so just this for an article:</p>

<p>“Moreover, patients treated with luteal estrogen resulted in an increased number of oocytes retrieved” link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-011-9685-7</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>ELONVA</strong>
Elonva consists of corifollitropin alfa drugs.com/uk/elonva.html . Since I’m a DORer, I’m looking for more oocytes, and don’t have to worry as much about OHSS (I think). In my first cycle there were three “possible” follicles, but only two retrieved and one mature. The hope is that Elonva will help my eggs grow in a more consistent manner and we’ll have more in the retrieval.</p>

<p>“The mean ± SD number of oocytes retrieved per started cycle was 13.3 ± 7.3 for corifollitropin alfa versus 10.6 ± 5.9 for rFSH” sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1472648310001707</p>

<p>“There was evidence of increased ovarian response and risk of OHSS in corifollitropin alfa.” sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0015028212001215</p>

<p>One of the upsides of it, is that it raises your hormone levels quicker and they stay higher longer -&gt; you don’t need to stick your self with a needle daily. slideshare.net/UARM/corifollitropin-alfa-elonva-clinical-trial-experience (See slide 5).</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>ORGALUTRAN</strong>
To stop ovaries from ovulating. This brand name isn’t as common but there were still a good number of hits when searching for info on the sub.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>OVITRELLE and GONAPEPTYL</strong>
Double trigger this time. There’s information on this on the sub also, but here’s some things I found interesting anyways:</p>

<p>“Patients who received the double trigger (study group) had a significantly higher number of mature oocytes – MII (6.5 versus 3.6 p &lt; 0.008), number of embryos transferred (2.4 versus 1.1 p &lt; 0.03), a significantly higher proportions of MII oocytes per number of oocytes retrieved (69.7% versus 47.1% p &lt; 0.03) and a higher number of top quality embryos (3.1 versus 1 p &lt; 0.02), as compared to their previous control cycles (hCG-only trigger)” tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09513590.2014.978850</p>

<p>“The use of the ‘‘double trigger” has been successfully offered in the treatment of empty follicle syndrome and in patients with a history of immature oocytes retrieved or with low/poor oocytes yield” tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09513590.2016.1193141</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TEROLUT</strong>
Terolut is made of dydrogesteron, and it’s taken orally, yay! </p>

<p>“The on-going pregnancy rates were comparable between Crinone 8%® vaginal progesterone gel and oral dydrogesterone – Duphaston® (28.1% versus 30.3%; OR 1.11 (0.82–1.49 with 95% CI)). Overall satisfaction and tolerability were significantly higher in the dydrogesterone group” sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211514005855</p>

<p>“Although all the predictive and confounding factors could not be controlled for, the results of this systematic review show a significant reduction of 47% in the odds for miscarriage when dydrogesterone is compared to standard care indicating a real treatment effect.” tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09513590.2012.702875</p>

<p>“Clinical pregnancy rate in cyclogest group was higher than dydrogesterone group but the difference was not significant (p=0.52), furthermore the miscarriage rate in two group was the same “ ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941387/</p>

Quick intro - H (38M) and I (35F) are now scheduled to start IVF in April. I had minor endo last year which was removed succesfully after a lap - no recurrent issues since then.  I need to be on medication for the next 6 weeks to lower my thyroid levels prior to starting IVF.

I have friends who have done IVF already so I know  how difficult this could be and that we may be looking at multiple rounds. After 18 unsuccesful months of trying and testing, it is exhausting to stay positive and I am really worried that the IVF meds will send my anxiety sky high. I am already having problems sleeping. I used to be very sociable but have been withdrawing from friends recently as they all have babies now which is making the anxiety worse. 

I feel really alone because there is nobody to talk to and i don't feel my husband knows how to be supportive or is as invested as I am. In his mind, his involvement will be helping me at egg collection and transfer without thinking about how for me this will a daily thing for up to 6 weeks. I feel really resentful that I am going to be doing all the heavy lifting from a physical perspective (unavoidable) and so I need him to be more emotionally engaged. I was hugely upset when I found out yesterday that he had forgotten most of the info provided in our first appointment and so asked me some very basic info (I mean its not hard to take some basic notes or look things up!) He had also completly forgotten that I have more doctors appts scheduled in the next few weeks to manage the thyroid issue before we can go anywhere near IVF.

I have been doing everything I can to get myself into the best physical and mental state whilst he has made no attempts to change his lifestyle. His primary focus right now is a big work project. We both have demanding and senior level jobs. Last week we both had massive work meetings and deadlines. The difference is that he has the privelege of giving work 100% of his attention whilst mine is split all over the place as I am also doing all the basic life admin for us both whilst having to be the one following up with doctors etc.  I had to speak to HR last week to inform them about IVF as I travel a lot and so needed to request some flexibility around this in April/May. Which obvs will impact my career as the partners now have notice I am trying to get pregnant so why would they bother lining me up for career advances/pay rises in the next year.

Husband sent me back to get a print out and lucky I did because while reading it I noticed leukocytes flagged with a reading of 2.

All research I can find is 'potential infection, inflammation' including in this subs wiki but I can't find anything on the significance if all other parameters are excellent. Is it enough to be the sole cause of our infertility (other than my short LP)?

I guess the question is, are any effects likely to already be apparent in the analysis and so if the results were fine stop worrying, or is it damage that is caused after ejaculation once the sperm are released into the seminal fluid that is causing issues in the cervix/ tubes etc. 

I was put on progesterone suppositories to help my own issues (short LP) and don't want to spend a crazy amount of money for this months' supply if it will do squat until these leukocytes are dealt with. (And does this need to be looked at by a urologist or can any old PCP treat this).

In addition, husband's FSH and progesterone came back low (Also discovered via print out), which I can't find any info on other than a potential pituitary issue (his LH and prolactin are fine) or hypogonadism (other SA parameters and testosterone are fine). Would this just be a case of don't worry about all the precursors to the development of the sperm as long as the sperm themselves are fine?

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Infertility includes: primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.

My cycles are generally 33-36 days.

Last cycle was unmedicated as I needed to have a pipelle biopsy. I required an USS before the biopsy which happened to be CD20 and that showed a corpus luteum and that I had just ovulated, naturally (historically doesn't always happen for me). This was confirmed a week later with a progesterone test.

This cycle I was put on 100mg Clomid CD3-7 for a monitored cycle. On CD10 my estradiol level was only 150 (it was supposed to be around 500!). Two days later CD12 my estradiol level had not risen at all, in fact, it had dropped to 130! So, the clinic cancelled the monitored cycle and have planned for me to increase the dose a final time and try 150mg Clomiphene next cycle. I was disappointed. However, OPK at home suggested a LH surge around CD19/20. I happened to mention it to my acupuncturist a few days later and she had me test my progesterone level yesterday at CD27 - which actually confirmed ovulation after all. I am surprised. Also a bit confused.

Do you think that my body didn't respond to Clomid at all but that I ovulated on my own? Or, do you think the Clomid did in fact work but just on a slower time line than most women??

The reason I ask is if I don't need Clomid I could choose not to try it again next cycle. (I have tried it 4 times though not consecutively). I worry about my CM and lining not to mention the cost of monitoring. However, I am also 41 and I don't feel I have time to experiment, so if Clomid is inducing ovulation, I want it.

Thanks all!

So basically we've been ttc for almost five years now with no luck! In January we decided to attend a fertility clinic. All is well with my partner so they think I'm the problem.  Our consultant referred me to have a hsg.

I had an appointment for a Hsg at the end of January but unfortunately couldn't go through with it as I was so nervous. It was a man performing the test so I was extremely anxious. It took him about 15 minutes to actually get the cathather through but when he didn't I just couldn't bare the pain. 

I have another appointment on Monday to try it again. Does anyone know if its okay to take a relaxer? My gp has prescribed 2mg of Anxicalm to help but I'm wary of taking it in case it could interfere with the test. Any advice would be really appreciated.

Thanks a mil guys

I&#39;m left with another cyst and 2 follicles.  Cancelled because not a good start to IVF.  Clinic solution is to go back on birth control for another 2 weeks, with no explanation given (just relayed by a random nurse).  I refused the insanity of it all.  Birth Control isn&#39;t working for me and they&#39;re treatment of me feels like I&#39;m just another number.  I want to advocate for myself better, but I don&#39;t know how.  DOR age 41...Financially they have us by the balls...I&#39;m scared and don&#39;t know what to do.  Love to all of you warriors.  I&#39;m at my wits end here</p>

I’ve had a 28-29 day cycle my entire adult life (I just turned 40) and until now I’ve never missed a period. During the last year of trying to conceive with no luck, I charted ovulation and seemed to always ovulate on day 12-14. Cycle normal.

No dice. Went back in a week later 2/25 for blood tests and ultrasound and no ovulation — now estrogen &amp; progesterone low, back to “baseline”. Doctor surprised I didn’t get a period based on my labs. I have cramps and PMS symptoms but no period.

I'm 26 and he is 28. We've been ttc for about 6 months but waiting a year before seeking help would be a waste of time since I only cycle about once a year, and I know it's likely anovulatory based on my medical history.

I did have a major bleeding event about in September of 2018 where I ended up in the hospital and had to take medicine to curb the bleeding - labwork wasn't very helpful, high LH and other hormone levels meant I was told by my doctors that it could have been a random event brought on by extremely thick uterine lining (it had been 2 years since I had a period) or it could have been a CP.

I have PCOS (diagnosed at 18 and confirmed many many times since) complete with acne, hirsutism, weight gain, etc. I struggle to stay around 190-210lbs even though my husband and I eat a well balanced low carb diet and we're active every week (backpacking, hiking, firefighting, exercise bike, etc)

But anyway, we've landed with a wonderful RE and we're working our way through our first IUI cycle. 

Our RE confirmed PCO both ovaries and said she felt Letrozole 5mg was a good starting point for us. 

I took provera and bled after 7 days (super exciting for me!) And went in on day 2 for baseline labs and ultrasound.

Ultrasound: no cysts 

AMH: 6.8 ng/l

Estradiol: 45.28 pg/l

FSH: 4.96 mIU/l

LH: 5.88 mIU/l

I took Letrozole 5mg on CD 3-7


Today is CD 10 and I'm going in for an HSG

Tomorrow I'm supposed to test with an OPK

Friday (CD 12) I'm going in for my midcycle ultrasound to see how I'm responding.


Lastly, husband's SA had some mixed results:

Volume: 5.5ml

Concentration: 49.3x10^(6)/ml

Motility: 9%

Activity: 3

Forward Progression: 3

pH: 8

Morphology: 10%


Our RE didn't seem concerned but she did start him on a bunch of supplements. He is extremely active and a competetive athlete (BJJ, kickboxing) so I'm concerned maybe heat is a factor... he's started taking cool showers after working out, so maybe that will help? Also he abstained for 3 days before the SA collection (not on purpose, just happened that way) so maybe that contributed?

Anything jump out at anyone? Since this is our first time through, we're a bit overwhelmed and feeling a little lost in the process.

My wife and I (M-29) have been married for 7 years now. About 3 years ago I was in a paid fertility study because we were going to start trying to get pregnant.

Results were 0 sperm count. Lots of doctors, specialists, genetic councilors, etc resulted in the diagnosis of CBAVD and atypical Cystic Fibrosis. I got lucky and have basically 0 side effects of CF except infertility.

We've discussed IVF as it's still a possible option, but ultimately I think I'm OK with just not having biological children. My family has a history of other health issues and me passing on my genetic condition to make my kids carriers feels like a huge risk to their kids and future generations. 

Is it selfish for me to not want to have my biological children? I would be glad to help pick out a genetically superior male to be the sperm donor for my wife, or adopt a child in need of parents.

My wife says she's OK with my decision, but occasionally (once or twice a year) brings it back up again which makes me think she's not 100% sold.

I am new here and I posted this in another forum as well, but thinking I would get answers here as well.

Anyone here has had a bleeding that happened few days again after the withdrawal period on taking Provera? 

Did you go on to change the medication or what did you do to stop that from happening?

Little background here:

I have had PCOS since my teenage years. Ever since puberty, i have had weird cycles, long apart. Been on Birth control pills on and off to try and regulate. Since 2016 i have been on BC pills continuously. Pretty sure I have had anovulatory cycles in the past when i was younger and the few months  I was off BC pills as well.

Had a hymenectomy done in Feb 2019 due to a septate hymen. Stopped BC pills in March 2019 followed by a withdrawal bleeding. Cycles I had following that:

* **May 31, 2019 - After 86 days -** ***Natural period***
* **July 8, 2019 - After 37 days -** ***Natural period - Charting since this cycle***
* **Oct 13, 2019 - After 97 days -** ***Provera induced*** ***(10 mg for 10 days)***

Pills from Sep 26 to Oct 5

Spotting Oct 10-12

Period Oct 13-19

Spotting Oct 20-21

* **Oct 29, 2019 -** ***Bleeding again after 8 days - Natural Period***
* **Dec 31, 2019 - After 63 days** ***- Natural period - Very light***
* **Jan 29, 2020 - After 29 days - 1st cycle -**  ***Provera induced*** (***10mg for 10 days) + Letrozole (2.5mg CD 3-7)***

Pills from Jan 12-21

Spotting from Jan 23-28

Period through Jan 29 - Feb 4 - CD 1-CD 7

Letrozole 2.5mg CD 3-7 (Jan 31 - Feb 4)

Ultrasound on CD 13 (Feb 10) - 3cm follicle on left ovary

Spotting CD 15, 16 & 18

Light flow that required a sanitary pad and filled quarter to half of it - Feb 16,17,18, 19

Intercourse - CD 13, 14, 16, 17, 18

CD 21 (Feb 17) - Progesterone blood test - Result yet to know - Doctor did a vaginal ultrasound and said the lining has been shed and the follicles look empty so told me to consider it a new cycle.

Initially she thought it could have been ovulation bleeding but after the ultrasound she was sure it was not and that it was a proper period. She said this bleeding could have been due to hormone balancing but was not entirely sure why.  As of CD 13, she said she was sure that i'd ovulate any time soon, but it so happened it ended up in a period

* **Feb 16, 2020** **-** ***Bleeding again after 11 days - Natural Period - CD 1***

It seems to be like both the times I took Provera, I bled again in a week or 10 days. I am to start it again from CD 15/16 (March 1 or 2) and start my second cycle with letrozole. The doctor did not want to up my dosage because she said my follicle size was good with 2.5 mg . I am worried i'll bleed again after my withdrawal period this time. It feels like the whole point of taking Letrozole seems a waste because of that.

Just relax, they said…

Look, your neighbour has 3 kids, it will happen to you too.

Just relax, they said. Just stop thinking about it.

Altho you are a bit overweight. Gotta get your weight under control, otherwise, an embryo will never implant.

But don't stress. Stress is bad for you. Better clean up your diet, eat your veggies, and relax. Wait, you are cutting too many calories. You will trigger your body into starvation mode. 

You should just relax. 

Better get to a workout, cos sitting all day is not good. How can you expect to carry a baby to term if you don't move? But don't work out too much, cos that way you'll never get pregnant. Don't obsess. Don't think about it.

Look at your best friend, she got pregnant on her first try. You have to relax and forget about it and it will happen. Test your ovulation, monitor your cervical mucus, take your temperature every morning at the same time, time your intercourse, but don't lose spontaneity. Your man doesn't want to know about all this, just relax and don't think about it. 

You are taking too many medications, what vitamins are you taking? Those are useless, you should take all-natural supplements instead. Now you are obsessing again, why aren't you relaxing? Stop complaining, shut up, don't mention it. Smile through yet another baby shower and shed tears of joy when another friend announces her pregnancy. Don't mention your doctor's appointment, nobody wants to hear about your sonohysterogram.

You miscarried? Well, at least you know you can get pregnant. 

Probably you should relax. At least it happened early on. Think about those women losing a baby in their late pregnancy. 

Just relax. Why don't you look into adopting? That woman adopted, finally relaxed and got pregnant. At least you can drink alcohol and eat sushi. Others didn't have a cocktail in years, you can just let loose and get out of the house any time you want. 

So just relax. but for god's sake, don't get drunk. If you drink every day, are you sure you are ready to be a mom? You know how demanding kids are. 

Just relax, they said… 

Don't mention when you feel tired. Look at her, she has twins. If you are tired now, how will you handle the night feedings? At least you can sleep in. Just relax, and be happy for all your money you can save by not having to spend it on kids. You have no idea how expensive a baby is.

Just relax, they said… don't complain, don't talk about it, don't think about it, don't eat junk food, don't work out a lot, keep your weight down, don't obsess, don't forget to monitor your ovulation, don't stress, don't lose spontaneity in your sex life, don't use all those harsh chemicals (anyway, you don't want to kill the planet, right?), don't be crazy, don't be jealous.

Just relax… smile. Be grateful. Be happy. Buy another onesie for somebody else's kid. Don't mention your losses.

We have been with our RE for 2.5 years. I’ve always felt like our doctor is very competent and up to date with fertility research. We have however run into many issues with the office that are so frustrating. Most recently they did not send over the results from our dna fragmentation test to our urologist...after telling me they did. I wasn’t even notified that the results had arrived. We feel like most of the issues are communication related. We’ve had to call for beta results after hours (on 2 separate occasions), we discussed banking embryos before sending to PGT, but no one followed up and they only sent the 1 from our cycle and 1 that was already frozen.

We’ve done 3 retrievals, 5 transfers, had 5 early losses (all around the same time), PGT with our last cycle (which ended the same way), and have nothing to show for it. Our plan was to do the dna fragmentation test, ERA, and then another retrieval because we are out of embryos. 

Our dna fragmentation came back normal, but the urologist did find 2 varicoceles that we can repair if we would like. I went to schedule the ERA and the nurse was so unprofessional on the phone and I had to call back the next week for clarification.

We had a second opinion today and it was just alright. Nothing bad. I just was really hoping to have a clear feeling of what direction to go in. I feel more confused! This 2nd doc suggested a different IVF protocol, no ERA, she was questionable about PGT, and to do a fresh transfer. I just don’t feel like that’s the answer.

240,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey, guys. Here's my story:

Recurrent pregnancy loss/miscarriage for almost 2 yrs now. Approx. (guessing because I lost count?) 15 back to back pregnancy losses over the course of 2 yrs, ever since I took my IUD out (5/18). I get pregnant every single cycle and lose the pregnancy every single time. All were lost before 8 weeks a pre heartbeat minus a 16 week loss. Went to the IVF clinic and all of my testing has come back normal except I have an arcuate uterus. I've been tested by other docs as well. I've tried progesterone at various doses during the luteal phase just incase and that didn't work either. I really think it's my arcuate uterus (which really isn't any/much different than a subseptate uterus, except that arcuate is an intentation less than 1cm and subseptate is over). Anyhow, there's tons of research linking arcuate uterus to recurrent pregnancy loss (all of which I have printed to share with the docs I have upcoming appts. with), and how surgery DRASTICALLY IMPROVES live birth rate. Anyway, IVF guy doesn't perform surgery for arcuate uterus because he considers it a ""normal variation"" (ok yes some research agrees but a lot of other research indicates that it IS a factor in recurrent loss). He figures it's great news because I don't ""need surgery"". Yep dude... sending me away with no answers is great news! He says keep trying because there's only a 30% miscarriage rate for people with ""no issues"" like me... HELLO I HAVE 100% MISCARRIAGE RATE... 15/15 is NOT 30%! Wanted to punch him in the head but whatever just got out of there and started on the google to find doctors who DO and will surgically treat arcuate uterus. Have 3 upcoming appointments scheduled with doctors who apparently treat arcuate uterus, including one who published the research on the importance of surgical resection in recurrent loss patients... so if HE won't perform it, then I'll REALLY throw my hands up!!! But I can't see how that would be the case.... at this point though, seriously, who knows!?

&#x200B;

Anyone else here with an arcuate uterus? What have you been told? Do you want corrective surgery? Have you had surgery? Some doctors believe it can contribute to recurrent loss, others don't. I, personally, believe that in my case, it probably is the issue and I REALLY WANT TO HAVE SURGERY AND GET THIS OVER WITH!!! There's SO MUCH research pointing to normal outcomes after surgical resection... WHY OH WHY IS THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY SO DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE!!??? Tell me about your uterus <3 Thanks for listening.

&#x200B;

EDIT: FYI, and just incase it helps anyone else with an arcuate uterus... here is the research that I found that indicates that arcuate uterus is a probable cause for recurrent pregnancy loss and that corrective surgery DRASTICALLY (success rates are the same as those without RPL after) improves outcomes (particularly when no other cause is found):

<p>EDIT: FYI, and just incase it helps anyone else with an arcuate uterus... here is the research that I found that indicates that arcuate uterus is a probable cause for recurrent pregnancy loss and that corrective surgery DRASTICALLY (success rates are the same as those without RPL after) improves outcomes (particularly when no other cause is found):</p>

Flying / Airport Security

* It's worth having a doctor's note printed out and handy. You'll rarely or perhaps never get asked for it in the US, but other countries like the UK definitely want to read it. I've even had the name on it matched against my passport.
* If you are traveling with ice packs, choose hard packs over soft packs. Technically you are allowed to travel with either for medical reasons, but hard packs are farther from a liquid so you're less likely to have to have a conversation about it.
* If you are going through a country that is more likely to need to paw everything, put all your liquid meds in separate small plastic bags to minimize that creepy experience of watching a security agent touch something you are about stick into your body.
* Always keep all your meds and med paraphernalia in your carry-on.
* You might as well tell security in advance that you are carrying meds, though that usually will not stop you getting searched if it's that kind of place.

Refrigeration

* For meds that need to be kept cold, you need a travel cooler bag, and some hard freezer packs. With [this cooler bag](https://www.miersports.com/collections/coolers-lunch-bags/products/portable-thermal-insulated-cooler-bag?variant=31266848309382) and [these four slim ice packs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FO2B5U), I've been able to travel for 20+ hours and still keep things cool enough.
* A hotel refrigerator will likely not have a freezer, but most mid-range hotels and up will have a protocol for taking freezer items from guests and storing them in their kitchen freezers if you ask. They'll plastic bag them and give you a claim ticket. Just remember to ask for your ice packs back when you leave!
* Don't be afraid to call places ahead about onsite options. For example, someone on here a month or so back mentioned that Disney lets you store meds in their medical center refrigerators. I've also had to negotiate in advance with the ""high priestess"" for refrigerator access in a mom-and-pop B&B that didn't have any in the rooms (true story).

Time Zones

* Know the time differences and plan ahead. For example, if you have to take a shot within an hour and you are dealing with an 8-hour time difference, then you can take a daily shot as early as 10pm in one place and as late as 7am in the other, whereas 8pm/5am might suck more.
* Write out a spreadsheet with the medication times day by day in your relevant time zones. This is especially important with places that are farther apart in terms of time zones because on travel days you may wind up taking two doses in a single daytime (or none), depending whether you are going into or against time.

Miscellaneous

* Trust your own judgement about the cleanliness of surfaces in your hotel room. I often think sheets and towels are the most guaranteed clean surfaces, so I do subcutaneous shots on the bed, and if I do need to stand, like for PIO, I waste a clean towel covering the bathroom counter.
* I'm sure you already have an old-lady pill organizer by now, but if you don't you want one. They are especially handy while traveling, when you are out of your usual routine. I love [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y55LDZJ) because color plus I can carry the individual day containers in my purse.
* [u/dawndilioso](https://www.reddit.com/user/dawndilioso/) changed my life with the recent pro-tip to stop filling hot water bottles from coffee makers for PIO and instead start buying single-use lower back wrap heating pads for travel.

I looked through the wiki and found a thread on RPL, but not RIF. (if we end up with enough good info here maybe this could become a wiki thread?)

My history is unexplained infertility, duration 4 years. I have done 1 cycle IVF with good fertilization via ICSI, with three transfers resulting in implantation failure (no HCG detected, 1 fresh day3 SET, 1 frozen medicated day5 blast SET, and 1 frozen medicated day3 DET). Given the statistics of each individual transfer, there is about a 40% chance I am just unlucky and there is nothing else wrong. However I am unwilling to jump into another transfer cycle without at least investigating whether there could be other problems. 

I found these research paper on causes, diagnosis, and treatment for RIF:

https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-018-0414-2 (2018)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510376/ (2012)

Which both cover a lot of ground. 

What tests/diagnostics should I ask about? Are there any tests you all would recommend I ask about before continuing treatment? I know this community are big advocates of ERA, which I will certainly ask my RE about. I will also inquire about an RPL blood panel. Since I have a history of ureaplasma infection, I also plan to ask about tests for silent endometritis. I don’t know much about immunological factors, but if anyone has experience there with RIF it could be helpful. What about further tests for my partner?

Finally, does anyone have experience with medication protocols for FETs after RIF?

I have done 1 cycle IVF with good fertilization via ICSI, with three transfers resulting in implantation failure (no HCG detected, 1 fresh day3 SET, 1 frozen medicated day5 blast SET, and 1 frozen medicated day3 DET). Given the statistics of each individual transfer, there is about a 40% chance I am just unlucky and there is nothing else wrong. However I am unwilling to jump into another transfer cycle without at least investigating whether there could be other problems. </p>

<p>I found these research paper on causes, diagnosis, and treatment for RIF:</p>

<p><a href=""https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-018-0414-2"">https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12958-018-0414-2</a> (2018)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510376/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510376/</a> (2012)</p>

<p>Which both cover a lot of ground. </p>

<p>What tests/diagnostics should I ask about? Are there any tests you all would recommend I ask about before continuing treatment? I know this community are big advocates of ERA, which I will certainly ask my RE about. I will also inquire about an RPL blood panel. Since I have a history of ureaplasma infection, I also plan to ask about tests for silent endometritis. I don’t know much about immunological factors, but if anyone has experience there with RIF it could be helpful. What about further tests for my partner?</p>

<p>Finally, does anyone have experience with medication protocols for FETs after RIF? </p>

<p>Thanks everyone in advance, I will also update with any useful information I get from my RE.</p>

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

Plus I just looked at my genes and found that I hit nearly all the endometriosis risk genes, including the ones that only 5% of the population has and such.</p>

<p>Edit: I had the surgery done and conceived the first cycle after. Stupid doctor that didn&#39;t listen to anything I said.</p>

It was very heartwarming  to hear all of these things I know about my husband said out loud by other people.

That behind said...It's been a source of frustration that hockey has become a priority to him.  I have compromised many times and agreed to push back our IVF date to accommodate his schedule. We had tickets to a concert that he now won't be attending because of playoffs. It's safe to say I'm bitter.  

Here is where it gets sticky.  

He's an attorney by day, and works long hours. That, coupled with hockey makes it so he's sometimes not getting home until 1030pm on game nights (on non game nights, he gets home around 7pm).  Right now, that's fine with me because we spend time together once he gets home and on the weekends. 

I'm trying to be realistic after so much disappointment, but because I am a planner,  I need to think about what may happen if our IVF round works...it would mean that we would have a winter baby...right in the middle of hockey season. I am really struggling with the idea of him coaching next season and how his schedule will make parenting a new baby with me almost impossible...but it pains me to think about asking him to give up something that brings him so much happiness... at the same time, I'm unwilling to parent a child (at least M-F) alone.  We don't have a lot of family around and I also struggle with seasonal depression...so I'm also very concerned about PPD. 

One of my friends said,  'he has to quit, there's no question about it, you've given up enough, it's your turn to take control""... that wasn't helpful and is so outside the realm of my personality... so please don't offer that suggestion. 

I don't want to ask him to give up something he loves... and because he's my polar opposite, if I bring this up to him, he'll tell me ""we'll figure it out, don't plan so far ahead"".   I'm trying to figure out a compromise, but I can't picture a scenario where one of us doesn't resent the other.

Hi, I am hoping to get some advice. I am 30 years old, have been trying for 8 months using OPKs the entire time (9 cycles in total because one month we were told to not try). The first month we tried ended in a very early miscarriage. All tests for my partner and I came out normal except for the HSG which showed one blocked tube (proximal, not hydrosalpinx). I have never had any STDs or pelvic pain, infections, etc. My periods are normal and regular, though I tend to ovulate on the later side (day 18-21). My AMH score was very high, which my RE said was a good sign because it meant I had a lot of eggs. He did not have any concerns for PCOS. My RE suggested doing clomid + IUIs and said we have a 15% chance of success. He said on our own, our chances of conceiving are 5-8% per cycle. He said if that doesn't work out we can move on to IVF, which has a much higher chance of success. I have 50% coverage for IVF, but am also thinking of leaving this job because of my commute. Any thoughts on next steps? Continue trying on our own? Try one cycle of IUI and clomid and then move on to IVF to take advantage of my current insurance? Anyone else here have one blocked tube?

<p>Hi, I am hoping to get some advice. I am 30 years old, have been trying for 8 months using OPKs the entire time (9 cycles in total because one month we were told to not try). The first month we tried ended in a very early miscarriage. All tests for my partner and I came out normal except for the HSG which showed one blocked tube (proximal, not hydrosalpinx). I have never had any STDs or pelvic pain, infections, etc. My periods are normal and regular, though I tend to ovulate on the later side (day 18-21). My AMH score was very high, which my RE said was a good sign because it meant I had a lot of eggs. He did not have any concerns for PCOS. My RE suggested doing clomid + IUIs and said we have a 15% chance of success. He said on our own, our chances of conceiving are 5-8% per cycle. He said if that doesn&#39;t work out we can move on to IVF, which has a much higher chance of success. I have 50% coverage for IVF, but am also thinking of leaving this job because of my commute. Any thoughts on next steps? Continue trying on our own? Try one cycle of IUI and clomid and then move on to IVF to take advantage of my current insurance? Anyone else here have one blocked tube? What was your treatment plan? And is tubal recanalization not a good option?</p>

Had an MRI yesterday, confirmed diffuse adenomyosis.

I have PCOS and had 3 miscarriages, but all were genetic and from IUI cycles. I was not presenting as a typical adenomyosis patient, so I was under the assumption that if it was, it was at least mild. The diffuse diagnosis has really thrown me for a loop.

We are planning to treat with 3 months of lupron between egg retrieval/PGS and FET. 
I've seen some studies suggesting that this is helpful, but most of the outcomes are related to pregnancy rates, not live birth rates. We know I can get pregnant, we don't know if I can carry to term. Has anyone seen any research on the effectiveness of Lupron on live birthrates?

Is anyone else in the similar situation?

First time here, so let me introduce myself and where we're at. We started trying a bit more than a year ago, but recently got diagnosed with MFI. We're trying to investigate further what is the cause for it, but no success so far... So the next step ahead of us seems to be IVF.

But we're moving countries in 4 months. We're currently in Portugal and we're going to the UK in June. Also, I'm finishing my PhD later this year, so it'd take quite some time before things get calmer again.... 

We're on the waiting list for the public health system in Portugal (but it takes an average of 2 years until treatment, so that won't work) and from what we read we can only apply for it in the UK after residing in an area for one year.

So we decided to do a private round, the question is when? In Portugal, before we move or after we've settled in the UK. 

I've been leaning towards Portugal as we've lived here for the past 6 years (I'm brazilian, my husband is british) and i've finally built a great support network. But I'm not sure if I'm being too naive about the process.

I guess what I am asking is how to handle big moves (the one thing you see written at pro IVF tips everywhere) when they're unavoidable...

<p>I don’t know what cosmic being is out there, whether it’s God or some other mysterious force, that wanted to beat us down emotionally to a pulp but all I can say is this: you did it. You win. I give up. I hope it makes you happy in your own sick and twisted way. </p>

<p>People will tell me to just adopt but that’s just not really an option for us at this point. Maybe someday. But not now. </p>

<p>I’ve watched as other women with severe infertility whether of their own or MFI “graduate” from this sub and from Facebook groups I’ve been a part of all while I just have to sit back and continue sitting in the same spot I’ve been in for over a year. </p>

<p>Goodbye everyone. I think I’m moving on to <a href=""/r/IFchildfree"">r/IFchildfree</a>. I think it’s time to start finding fulfillment in my life elsewhere.</p>

306,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All,

I'm new here. I tried searching prior to posting and couldn't find much on the subject.

For context, I'm 32 my husband is 33 and we have 1 LC. Over the past year, we've had 1 12 week MMC,  and 1 5 week loss. Seeking IVF because of recurrent loss.

We've done all the normal fertility work-up/ genetic testing and they can't find anything wrong with either of us. Of course, as I'm sure everyone here knows all too well, that doesn't mean there isn't something wrong and for us, it reared its ugly head post egg retrieval.

I responded well to my first round of IVF stims and had a decent egg retrieval:

10 eggs retrieved --> 7 fertilized --> ***0 blastocysts***

Yep, zilch. We had a day 5 transfer scheduled and drove to the office only to get the bad news there. It was pretty evident this doesn't typically happen. My RE apologized and said statistically, if you have more than 4 that fertilize at least 1 makes it to blastocyst stage so they do not do a Day 3 check so as not to disturb development. Well, we fell on the wrong side of statistics.

The RE said a lot of times when embryos arrest post day 3 it's a DNA fragmentation issue. So my husband went in for the DNA fragmentation sperm analysis and we just got the call saying everything came back completely normal so that's not the issue.

Basically, the plan is for me to take COQ10 to make a few minor changes to my STIMS, and to do a day 3 transfer (and freeze of any excess) in the hope that I just have embryos that can't thrive outside of the uterus for too long and will do ok once transferred.

Obviously, I'm feeling incredibly uneasy about all of this and going through the emotionally grueling IVF process again just to get my heartbroken once more.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced the same thing and can provide any insight or advice moving forward? If this happened to you did round 2 go better? Thank you!

My husband and I have been battling infertility (on my end) for just short of a decade now. At first it was timed intercourse, had a missed miscarriage and was advised to do IUI. Did IUI, had an ectopic pregnancy and was advised to do IVF. Did IVF, miscarried a baby with multiple aneuploidies and had another missed miscarriage. Advised to do PGS, did so and miscarried a PGS normal baby shortly after hearing the heartbeat. Finally, advised to do lupron down regulation for 3 months for my endometriosis, did it and went into premature labor and lost my baby at just short of 21 weeks gestation. Now being advised to do a prepregnancy cerclage.

My question is when do I stop? My rational mind is screaming at me “you’re obviously not meant to have children that all of this trauma just coincidentally happens to them and you”, but my heart, oh my heart is so much stronger. As we speak, I’m amidst another 3 month round of chemically induced menopause with my transabdominal cerclage scheduled for mid March.

I can’t stop because, now that my worst fear has been realized, giving birth to and then burying miracle baby, I have no more fear; nothing can hurt me more than I’ve been hurt.
