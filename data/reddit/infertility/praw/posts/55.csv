*Disclaimer: This is all for fun. Be skeptical all the time.*

I looked at the effects of (1) fresh vs. frozen, (2) PGS-tested vs. not, (3) number of embryos transferred, and (4) RPL vs. no RPL on implantation rates and success rates. The other variables in the sheet were missing too much information, but maybe I can come back to them later.

Success Rates:

Fresh cycles (n = 26) = 40%

Frozen cycles (n = 69) = 36%

PGS tested (n = 34) = 46%

Not PGS tested (n = 62) = 33%

Transferred 1 Embryo (n = 77) = 35%

Transferred 2 Embryos (n = 16) = 50%

Transferred 3 Embryos (n = 2) = 0%

RPL yes (n = 19) = 0%

RPL no (n = 69) = 51%

Next, I used binomial logistic regression to test which variables (cycle type, PGS testing, number transferred, RPL) affected the binary implantation or success outcomes (yes or no).

In summary - none of these factors was significantly associated with implantation success.

The only variable that was significantly associated with success rate was RPL. As you can see by the summary above, no one who said ""yes"" to RPL has had success in this database. (including me! yay!).

Total summary of the results from the Hunger Games and Transfer Analysis:

*Try not to have DOR. Get younger. Make sure you don't lose multiple pregnancies.*

30,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So remember how my RE's office oriented us to the wrong protocol, ordered a trigger shot we didn't need, forgot to order needed blood work, lost my husband's urine sample, billed us inappropriately for a hysteroscopy that was covered by insurance, and jerked us around by saying ""we're signing the contract with your new insurance company tomorrow!"" once per week for two months?

Things came to a head this week when my RE miscalculated my ovulation date, causing us to miss our opportunity for estrogen priming and pushing our IVF cycle back by another month. She miscalculated because she was basing her decision *only* on my progesterone level, and we now know that I have very low progesterone. She thought I ovulated on day 21 of my cycle, because she (or her nurses?) were completely ignoring my insistence that I had ovulated on day 17. They kept saying I hadn't ovulated yet even after I handed in a printed copy of my FertilityFriend chart [with crosshairs on day 17](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/591bf4), based on a positive OPK, change in cervical fluid, a ""textbook"" temp drop that is ""only seen in 1% of patients"" (but which I get every month), and a subsequent ""slow rise"" in BBT. 

When I emailed her to report that my period had started, my RE initially wrote back saying that we could start the antagonist protocol anyway (skipping the estrogen priming), but my husband and I decided that we weren't comfortable with that unless she could provide a good rationale for the change (other than just being eager to start *something*), and weren't comfortable starting *anything* without first having a serious come-to-Jesus talk with her and her staff.

We met with a different RE when we went to my day 2 monitoring appointment yesterday (there are 4 REs that rotate through multiple offices throughout the week). RE#2 was very empathic and listened to all of our concerns. He was 100% professional and said that he couldn't speak for RE#1, but he also couldn't hide the flabbergasted look on his face when he looked at my chart, and said ""yeah, it's pretty clear that you ovulated on day 17; you should have started estrogen last week."" He encouraged us to sit this cycle out and talk to RE#1 about our concerns. He also took the time to answer all of our questions about low progesterone, and said that this is probably one of the underlying reasons that I can't get pregnant. He said that he would relay all of our concerns to RE#1, and ask her to call us in the evening (my husband and I both had to work all day, and wouldn't have any time to talk to her together until 7pm... and she was suggesting that we start stims that night!).

RE#1 called us last night at 8pm, when my husband and I were on our third gin and tonic each. She was very apologetic and non-defensive, starting out by saying, ""You were right and I was wrong. I should have listened to what you were saying. If you feel like you can no longer trust me, I completely understand, and you should go to another doctor or another practice because you have to do what's best for you."" She said that if we *do* proceed with her, **I get to call the shots next time** - I'll tell them when to schedule my monitoring appointments, because with my low progesterone, it's clear that my charting is more accurate than blood work at confirming ovulation. I could opt to call them *after* I've confirmed ovulation myself, or could call them with my first positive OPK if I'd like the extra reassurance of having an ultrasound before and after ovulation. I can also ask for extra blood tests after ovulation, to see if/when/how high my progesterone peaks (""purely for intellectual reasons, because it won't change the plan... we're going to slam you with extra progesterone [if we make it to FET] no matter what"").

In the meantime, I have requested a copy of my medical records and scheduled a second-opinion consult at another local practice with RE#3, who is a apparently a national expert/researcher in DOR. The appointment is in 9 days, so we'll get the second opinion before I ovulate again, and can make a decision about whether to switch practices before I start priming for a potential April IVF cycle. Even if we decide not to switch practices, it will be nice to have the reassurance of a second opinion.

So once we get the second opinion, we have to decide whether to:

- Stick with RE#1 - probably not the best choice for us psychologically, but then again, I bet she's *really* going to listen to us and take us seriously in the future.

- Switch to RE#2 at the same practice - we love his bedside manner, wouldn't lose any more time or money, and he probably would be very attentive, knowing that we switched providers due to poor communication. However, after some googling, we've also discovered that our current practice *lost 3 out of 7 doctors in the past 1-2 years.* This probably explains why communication has been so poor, in contrast to the wonderful experience our friends had there 2 years ago; they literally have too many patients assigned to each doctor, and the nurses are scrambling to keep up. This makes us more sympathetic to everyone at the practice, but also tells us that we need to be on our toes to make sure there are no additional communication mishaps.

- Switch to RE#3 at a different practice - Pros include the fact that she's a DOR expert, and we would be starting with a clean slate. Maybe communication would be better than at our current practice. Cons include the fact that we would have less contact with REs and more contact with nurses at the new practice (their docs don't do the monitoring appointments), we don't know for a fact that communication would be better, and we would have to start over. We'd lose at least 1 month because they'd want to do their own hysteroscopy/mock transfer, pushing IVF back to May at the earliest. In addition, we would take a hit financially because we'd have to officially cancel our current round of IVF with our insurance company (to not waste a Progyny ""smart cycle"" on monitoring without a retrieval), and would have to retroactively pay for 8 blood tests and 2 ultrasounds completely out of pocket.

**tl;dr** We're really sad and disappointed to be benched for another month, but hearing my RE repeatedly apologize and admit that she was wrong felt pretty great. Getting a second opinion, and considering switching doctors and/or practices. No longer afraid of being the squeaky wheel; I refuse to sit back and blindly trust a doctor over my own data and gut feelings.

I'm a data-oriented person and want to track key statistics for this IVF cycle. Under the assumption that we might need multiple cycles, I want to be able to compare and contrast the different cycles and how they progressed (or didn't progress, whichever the case may be).

Does anyone know of a good spreadsheet template that's been created for this purpose? I could create one myself, but I'm new at this and not sure if I understand all the key things to track.

Some of my ideas were to have a row in a spreadsheet corresponding for every day beginning with the first day of my wife's menses or the start of the IVF cycle. I would document the medication(s) and dose given every day, and if there are blood tests, I would document those results for each day. For today's blood tests, the only results we got back were LH (Lutenizing Hormone) and Estradiol. I wonder if there will be additional tests in the future?

On days where there's also a sono, I would document number of follicles, approximate size of follicles, and endometrial thickness.

Got the numbers back and I'm having a hard time deciding whether to freak out or not. I have FSH of 8 and AMH of 0.14 (the doctor didn't give me any units). She (my regular GYN) said that FSH was ok, and AMH was ""a little low"" but not unreasonable for my age, and her interpretation is that it's not impossible but that we don't have much time.

However, Dr. Google tells me I should be completely freaking out about that low AMH score, and that it might mean IVF is even pretty unlikely. Am I missing something here? And if any of you have gone into this with similar numbers (and probably age), what was recommended?

I asked for a bit of time so that I could do some research (thanks u/giantredwoodforest for your amazing post!).  I fully accept that there's a chance our embryos weren't PGS normal (we don't really test in the UK) but I'm also looking at potential 'soil' issues and I've a few questions I'm hoping you wonderful people can help with.


On the day of transfer my progesterone was 19 ng/ml - my clinic wanted it to be 30 ng/ml.  For 5 days prior to transfer I was taking:


1. 600mg of Utrogestan a day - made me terribly sick and I want to remove/reduce it next time


2. Crinone vaginal gel 8% w/w 2 x day


3. Lentogest PIO  341mg/2ml alternate days



The day after transfer they increased the Crinone to 3 x day and added in Cyclogest rectal suppository 400mg 3 x day.  They tested my progesterone 4 days later and it had increased to 29 ng/ml and they were happy and kept everything the same.  Having read other people's posts on here it seems to me that I was on a very high dose of progesterone.  I have also read that blood tests when the suppositories are used are less reliable.  So my questions are:


1. Is there any chance my progesterone was actually too high and the blood results weren't accurate - is there such a thing as too much progesterone?


2. Can anyone send me a link to a good and accessible paper on the relationship between progesterone resistance and endo?  The only one I've found is this: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aogs.13156/full 


3. Has anyone in the UK had a ReceptivaDX test?  I can't find any info on it being done in the UK.  Whilst my 3dsis  and HSG were clear I'm worried that I could have silent endo.


4. Does anyone have experience with Prolutex/Lubion?  It's a SubQ progesterone injection.  As I want to swap the Utrogestan I'm looking at alternatives.

I know it is a long shot to write out my experiences here, but I think AART is so deeply flawed that I am trying to inform potential patients everywhere I can.

My doctor told me to keep losing weight and didn't prescribe any further treatments, like Clomid, or perform all tests that are considered reasonable diagnostic measures, like a Semen Analysis or internal ultrasound. In my opinion, this was because my doctor believed I should not be pregnant at my weight. In my opinion, this represents significant bias. 

* A Semen Analysis was only ordered once I strongly insisted for it to be ordered. After questioning my doctor about the clinic's denial of performing IUI, a Semen Analysis was finally ordered to support the single IUI procedure that my doctor was prepared to grant me. If I had not pushed for this IUI procedure, my doctor would still not have ordered a Semen Analysis, and I would still be incorrectly diagnosed. 

* After all of this fighting with my doctor, and at my strong insistence, the SA was ordered and discovered severe MFI. We were immediately referred to IVF + ICSI. 

* I feel that my doctor misrepresented information on referrals to fit a false narrative of my situation. While I was with the referral physician, and informing him that I was there to get treatment to reach a BMI that would permit me to receive IVF from AART, he read aloud to me the reason for referral included by my doctor. It stated in the referral that I wanted this consultation in order to be at my healthiest weight before becoming pregnant. This was not my intent, and that intent was clearly communicated to my doctor, as I had pushed and pushed to be permitted one round of IUI, and was prepared to fund any treatments or procedures required to become pregnant. However, the referral did not mention that I was being forced to this referral to adhere to the BMI policy at AART. I also feel that my doctor was informed of my clear wants and needs, but decided to include information in that referral that suggests a narrative of my situation that is untrue. 

* I feel there is a significant bias at the clinic that inhibits effective treatment of high BMI patients. This bias is evident even while undergoing procedures allowed to high BMI patients at this clinic.

* There is a limited number of circumstances that I would consent to receive treatment at AART (Atlantic Assisted Reproduction Therapies), as I no longer had trust in the professionalism or integrity of the physicians on staff.

Despite shitty numbers, my RE humours me and so we did a monitored cycle to see if I still ovulate on my own--no meds (stimming doesn't work for me; my FSH is way too high) just blood and ultrasound. It was a total Hail Mary, so the expectation was that nothing would happen.

My RE's conclusion is that, essentially, I'm shooting blanks: I might grow follicles but there's nothing in them. Given my menopause-like numbers, that's a pretty reasonable conclusion.

They clearly struggled with our problems, offering little to no support throughout our treatment.  I heard from her more than him and I would have considered him one of my closest friends at the time.  She wasn't particularly sensitive, and even with coaching couldn't seem to say the right thing (I know it's difficult to know what to say but I wrote a blog that I know they read, so you'd think they would have some idea!) 

Anyway, fast forward to last May, when we had our last miscarriage, we didn't hear a thing from them. We then went to their wedding at the end of the year  at which I tried my hardest to stay cool, even when she thought that was a good time to tell me how sorry she was (I just said, lets not talk about it today, and moved on to something else) 

They are now pregnant.  I found out because she posted some not so subtle tweets on Twitter! These tweets didn't announce the pregnancy, but hinted to some exciting news.  I messaged a mutual friend about it and she confirmed that they were pregnant and that she has explicitly told them they need to speak to use face to face about it.  I gave her permission to let them know that we know. The tweets disappeared (I think he was probably annoyed that she put them on there in the first place) and we got a message from him the next day. It said they wanted to tell us face to face, and didn't once acknowledge that they were pregnant, it was like he couldn't use the words in case that upset me.  I have thought about messaging him to tell him how hurt I am about the way he has behaved over the last year or so.  At the same time, I think it proves that we don't mean as much to them as I thought we did, and that our friendship has probably come to an end.

100,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Tl;dr: Does anyone know the cutoff for, possible reasons for, and implications of low progesterone after ovulation, particularly when heading into an IVF cycle? I tried searching, but there aren't many posts that address this.

Reason for my question:
I'm currently in the midst of an estrace priming cycle, which will hopefully be followed by an antagonist protocol. I had blood work every few days this cycle to confirm ovulation, but things did not go as planned because I got sick with a fever right when I was about to ovulate. This delayed ovulation by a few days, and also made it difficult to figure out the exact date on which I ovulated (looks like day 17 or day 19 - FertilityFriend moves my crosshairs around depending on whether I count my BBT for the day after my fever). 

In any case, my progesterone was only 3.2 on day 22 of my cycle (3 or 5 DPO), and was only 4.4 on 6 or 8 DPO. This seems really low compared to the few posts I've found on Reddit and Google. I also don't have much to compare it to, because this is only my second fully monitored cycle. Last time, my  progesterone was 5.2 on 3DPO, and my RE didn't do any further testing that cycle.

I'm curious if my progesterone is usually low (and if this is one of the underlying reasons for my infertility) or if I ovulated ""weakly"" because I was sick (and if this could affect the outcome of my upcoming cycle).

**Update (3 days later) for anyone comes across this thread in the future:** My cycle was canceled. It turns out my RE thought I ovulated on *day 21,* which is why she told me to wait until day 28 to start the estrogen. It turns out she was wrong and I was right; day 28 was actually day 1 of my next cycle, and I must have ovulated on day 17. We had a WTF phone call, during which my RE apologized and said that she should have listened to my intuition about my own body. She was basing her decision *purely on my progesterone level,* and wasn't considering any of the other data - LH, estrogen, BBT, or cervical fluid. (My husband suspects that she's taking the fall for poor decision-making or communication by her nurses.) 

She and another RE at the practice concurred that **although I probably did have a ""weak ovulation"" due to my fever, my progesterone is still lower than would be expected (and it might even be artificially inflated because I'm on DHEA). This is probably part of the reason why I'm infertile. Low progesterone in the luteal phase makes implantation less likely - but even before that, low progesterone in the luteal phase is probably a symptom of poor egg quality... that egg probably wouldn't have fertilized/implanted anyway.** If we actually get some good embryos out of this, low progesterone shouldn't be a problem because, ""we're going to slam you with progesterone no matter what.""

My RE wanted me to go ahead and start the antagonist protocol last night anyway (""there's really not a lot of data suggesting that one protocol is better than the other""), but my husband and I have opted to scrap this cycle, and try estrace priming again next month after getting a second opinion/sanity check, possibly switching to a different RE at the practice or a different practice all together, and insisting on better communication next time. My RE did say that if we proceed with her, I get to call the shots next time - I'll tell *them* when to schedule my monitoring appointments, because with my low progesterone, it's clear that my charting is more accurate than blood work at confirming ovulation!",t2_dfo13,False,,0,False,Low Progesterone,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_82hmni,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,1520703633.0,,[],{},,True,,1520391899.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Tl;dr: Does anyone know the cutoff for, possible reasons for, and implications of low progesterone after ovulation, particularly when heading into an IVF cycle?

115,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Backstory: My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant since January 2016 with no luck whatsoever. My periods have been becoming more and more irregular since the age of 16 (I'm currently 29), when I first started trying to get pregnant I had not had a period for around 2 years. I have had some since then, but they were medically induced and not naturally occurring. I also have not ovulated once (on my own) since we started trying. 

Around April 2016 I went to an OB-GYN who ran some tests. They all came back normal, but she still said she thought I had PCOS since I didn't ovulate on my own. My BMI is about 41, and she told me she couldn't give me any sort of fertility treatment until it was under 35. She recommended gastric bypass and sent me on my way. 

Between then and November 2017 I continued to try naturally (though I knew it was pointless), and tried to lose weight - something I had tried on and off since I randomly started gaining weight really rapidly at the age of 16 with absolutely no luck. 

In November I found a clinic that would offer me treatment despite my BMI.  It's worth noting that the Reproductive Endocrinologist I saw at this clinic did NOT think I had PCOS. Other than the fact that I don't ovulate, I have no other symptoms and no abnormal test results that would suggest PCOS is the problem here. I did two monitored cycles with Femara+Trigger and IUI. I produced a single follicle each cycle, but did not get pregnant either time. Unfortunately, I was unable to keep taking so many days off or late starts at work on such short notice to accommodate the ultrasounds and IUI. Because of this, I never went back for a 3rd cycle.

My husband and I are saving up for IVF in the Czech Republic as our next step. In the meantime, I wanted to see if there was somewhere that would let me do unmonitored cycles of Femara or Clomid (the previous clinic only did monitored ones). 

Way back when I first started trying to get pregnant I found a birth center that I really wanted to give birth at as opposed to birthing in a hospital. They have midwives and offer a nice mix of conventional western medicine, as well as holistic medicine. I was looking at their website and realized they also treat infertility. I went in for my first appointment last week. It was amazing. I spent an hour and a half with a midwife, and we went over every bit of information. She recommended some supplements that she thought might help regulating my cycle a bit, and wrote me a prescription of femara to start after a month of adjusting to the supplements. 

She also asked if anyone has ever tested my thyroid. When I said they haven't, she decided she would also do that since that could explain not only my infertility and lack of normal cycle, but also my difficulties losing weight, my anxiety, and depression.

I got a call back today - my thyroid is not functioning optimally for fertility, so she's writing me a prescription for synthetic hormones. 

I'm really hoping this helps me out. Not only with my fertility, but also with my weight and mental health. Fingers crossed!

Our very first ICSI, 4 years ago, was successful, but ended as a biochemical pregnancy at week 6. Afterwards nothing ever happened again.

Till last December. We finally changed the clinic and my new doctor did the impossible: she got me pregnant again! Unfortunately I had an abortion at week 6 again. The abortion is now 8 Weeks ago. 

My Doc suggested something totally new in Germany: a Double (Shanghai Protocol): you get stimulated twice in one cycle. No transfer. After the first punktion you get 4 days to rest and start the second stimulation. 

Because this procedure is new, I can’t find others, wo underwent this. I really would like to hear some experiences, because this is going to be very expensive for us. We’re going to pay everything twice: the meds, the punctions, the ultrasounds....

Here's mine, the Desiderata by Max Ehrmann


Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story. 

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. 

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism. 

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass. 

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself. 

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. 

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy. 

Max Ehrmann, Desiderata

Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism. </p>

<p>Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass. </p>

<p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself. </p>

<p>You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. </p>

<p>Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. </p>

<p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy. </p>

I at this point in time have no diagnosis, except that I don't ovulate. This is a long post, but I'm looking for advice. Trying to get my doctors to pay attention to my needs or run tests or even tell me what to consider is a battle, and one I have never dealt with before and don't know how to fight.

So, here's my story, all the below said, I'm looking for advice in speaking with my provider and better asserting things to actually make things happen.

I had very irregular and **extremely** painful periods when I was in my teens. So painful that I could not go to school or pretty much function at all. When I was out on my own at 19, I got on birth control, took the combined pill, to regulate my cycle and reduce my pain. Otherwise, I couldn't regularly work for a week a month.

At the time, the doctor said the only thing to do for my pain was to take the pill. I took it from 19 to 24. Eventually, I went on a continuous cycle, again for pain management. Got off it a year after marriage.

Now, I've been off for three years and have resumed irregular cycles. But, they are so MUCH worse than I remember before. Now, I can bleed sometimes for 20 days straight. Or bleed enough to fill my diva cup twice in 12 hours. I went to the doctor just over a year ago about this several times and got brushed off as it's not a concern.

Husband and I started trying to conceive in March last year. When I went to my yearly appointment and mentioned this *and* my irregular cycles, finally a few tests were done. But, not much. I don't have low thyroid, my hormones are within normal ranges (even if barely) so no PCOS, and in August I had one simple cyst, which I assume is gone now, but who knows. Current age: 27.

I've been taking letrozole for two cycles, with terrible side effects (bone pain and a few others). But I have not ovulated since July (8 cycles), when I started at home tests. I have been given no other tests alongside letrozole, no monitoring. I have had no communication with my doctor and feel very isolated and uncertain. Is there more I can ask for?

Updated Background:
Husband and I have been actively trying for almost 2 years. Due to a positive BRCA1 dx, my doctors have recommended a  risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy by 35. We were advised 2 years ago to fast-track starting a family (yeeeeeeeep). 

I was on Clomid for 3 months, then Femara for another 3. Each time had a good response; 3-4 large follicles. Went through two IUIs which weren't successful. After speaking to our RE about our time & finance situation, we decided to skip IUI with injectables and are moving to IVF in April.

Throughout this process, we've remain unexplained. **However** by lurking on here daily, I have very strong suspicions that I might have endo. While I don't have particularly painful periods, I do have:

- Spotting which starts 5 days before each period. Every period.
- Elevated CA-125 levels (83 U/mL)
- Tilted uterus
- Poor follicle growth when not on meds (7mm CD 14), albeit regular ovulation
- And of course, infertility

My question is this: should we try to pursue an endo dx before even attempting IVF? 

I have been reading an infinite number of research articles discussing the effect of endo on IVF success, and it sounds like stage 1/2 endo is associated with slightly reduced outcomes (compared to unexplained), and stage 3/4 significantly impacts outcomes. However, it sounds like all roads lead to IVF, regardless of stage. 

I'm personally leaning towards trying one round, which would at least give us additional diagnostic information if not successful. I wouldn't be able to schedule a lap to check for endo until the summer (when I have time off from work and can travel to a specialist who does excision), and of course it would be an additional cost in this process. My husband, however, feels like we are just wasting money if endo is the cause of our infertility. 

One additional point- we currently qualify for their IVF guarantee program, which will refund 80% of funds if treatment is not successful after 3 rounds. We were planning on signing up with this program to start. However, if diagnosed with stage 3/4 endo, we would no longer qualify.

I am a midwife and often deal with safeguarding issues, so I know this can&#39;t logically be true, or else why would so many criminals have children, but I still can&#39;t get past this sort of thinking.

My partner was recently prescribed Clomiphene in an effort to possibly raise his sperm count. He has to take one every second day for 3 months. 

He had 6 million last count, many with low motility. He has an varicocele but it hasn't been determined whether or not he'll require surgery. Our plan of action is government funded IVF unless his count can rise. 

I've had all my tests done and everything looks good. 

With any medication, should I be wary? Will his mood be effected? Will he be more tired? 

I want to support him as much as I can and this type of medication I am unfamiliar with. He seldom takes medication.

181,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"3 weeks ago I switched from one Boston IVF to another fertility clinic and I'm so glad. In case anyone ever searches through this board, I hope this serves as an early warning. 

I mentioned a while ago, but Boston IVF has this terrible policy where they never give you a direct line to the person you need to talk to. You have to call the front desk every time. Then she forwards you to someone's voicemail. Then that person calls you back. They never forward you to an actual human that you can talk to. I had to scramble out of a meeting 3 times because they just called me back whenever the fuck they felt like it. BTW, this is there policy. So that they ""know what you're calling about"" and what your state of mind is like beforehand or whatever. 

Why is this relevant? I got caught in a 7 day game of phone tag. Primarily because I was trying to get PGD testing pre-authorized. I called them asking them to initiate a pre-auth, sometime in December. I don't hear from them for a month. Mid-January comes around and I give them a call and leave a voicemail asking for an update. Boston IVF leaves me a voicemail telling me it was approved. I called my insurance to double check and they said it wasn't approved and they were waiting for paperwork from Boston IVF. I called Boston IVF and tell them they're missing paperwork. Someone else calls me back and leaves a voicemail saying their records indicate that everything is all set with insurance. Eventually I leave a pissed voicemail saying that I need to be sure and there needs to be a consensus between the insurance company and my doctors. They leave me a voicemail with a direct line for the first time ever. I then speak with the insurance specialist at Boston IVF and am told that they spoke on the phone with my insurance and was told that ""everything would be fine"". I asked them if they had this in writing. Of course they didn't. 

But, me being the dumb fuck that I am decided to believe them and that everything would be fine.

In case anyone ever searches through this board, I hope this serves as an early warning. </p>

<p>I mentioned a while ago, but Boston IVF has this terrible policy where they never give you a direct line to the person you need to talk to. You have to call the front desk every time. Then she forwards you to someone&#39;s voicemail. Then that person calls you back. They never forward you to an actual human that you can talk to. I had to scramble out of a meeting 3 times because they just called me back whenever the fuck they felt like it. BTW, this is there policy. So that they &quot;know what you&#39;re calling about&quot; and what your state of mind is like beforehand or whatever. </p>

<p>Why is this relevant? I got caught in a 7 day game of phone tag. Primarily because I was trying to get PGD testing pre-authorized. I called them asking them to initiate a pre-auth, sometime in December. I don&#39;t hear from them for a month. Mid-January comes around and I give them a call and leave a voicemail asking for an update. Boston IVF leaves me a voicemail telling me it was approved. I called my insurance to double check and they said it wasn&#39;t approved and they were waiting for paperwork from Boston IVF. I called Boston IVF and tell them they&#39;re missing paperwork. Someone else calls me back and leaves a voicemail saying their records indicate that everything is all set with insurance. Eventually I leave a pissed voicemail saying that I need to be sure and there needs to be a consensus between the insurance company and my doctors. They leave me a voicemail with a direct line for the first time ever. I then speak with the insurance specialist at Boston IVF and am told that they spoke on the phone with my insurance and was told that &quot;everything would be fine&quot;. I asked them if they had this in writing. Of course they didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>But, me being the dumb fuck that I am decided to believe them and that everything would be fine. </p>

I hope this is okay to post here - I have been a long time lurker and sometimes post-er over the past couple of years.  This community has created an amazing sense of belonging and well-being in my life on this topic - I am always grateful!

After 6 medicated cycles, 5 IUIs and 2 IVFs, we decided to give up on medical intervention about 12 months ago at age 40.. and then as I turned 41, we decided to get back in the game as we realized we still had a sliver of time to make this happen...

So here I am.. again. (Go big or go home, right?)

All of this to say that we are going for IVF #3 in April and have been taking the recommended supplements since Dec/Jan... and with our current protocol for #3, I am doing Estrace priming and have to monitor for ovulation. 

Bizarrely, in this month, I have continued to get a high reading on the OPK for 11 days now and wondered WTF is going on... 

I introduced some new homeopathic remedies recommended by my acupuncturist - that's the only new thing - oh and the acupuncture which I have been to twice in the past 2 weeks...

Anyone ever had experience with false high readings due to supplements? Any thoughts on why this might be happening?  I suppose I am concerned that I may not be able to get a read on my ovulation in order to accurately start the Estrace priming with my next ovulation so would appreciate any and all counsel / experience from you.

Thanks again to all of you for giving me hope and the strength to keep fighting for this...

<p>After 6 medicated cycles, 5 IUIs and 2 IVFs, we decided to give up on medical intervention about 12 months ago at age 40.. and then as I turned 41, we decided to get back in the game as we realized we still had a sliver of time to make this happen...</p>

<p>So here I am.. again. (Go big or go home, right?)</p>

<p>All of this to say that we are going for IVF #3 in April and have been taking the recommended supplements since Dec/Jan... and with our current protocol for #3, I am doing Estrace priming and have to monitor for ovulation. </p>

<p>Bizarrely, in this month, I have continued to get a high reading on the OPK for 11 days now and wondered WTF is going on... </p>

<p>I introduced some new homeopathic remedies recommended by my acupuncturist - that&#39;s the only new thing - oh and the acupuncture which I have been to twice in the past 2 weeks...</p>

<p>Anyone ever had experience with false high readings due to supplements? Any thoughts on why this might be happening?  I suppose I am concerned that I may not be able to get a read on my ovulation in order to accurately start the Estrace priming with my next ovulation so would appreciate any and all counsel / experience from you.</p>

<p>Thanks again to all of you for giving me hope and the strength to keep fighting for this... </p>

Abstract
Purpose
To investigate the prognostic value of growth of 4-cell embryos on the day of transfer in determining clinical pregnancy and live birth rates after fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer (ET) cycles.

Methods
Retrospective cohort study of all patients between January 2008 and January 2013 initiating fresh IVF-ET cycles resulting in embryos that were not more than 4 cells 72 h after oocyte retrieval in the morning of their transfer. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on whether embryos did or did not grow more than the 4-cell stage on the afternoon of ET. The odds of clinical pregnancy and live birth were considered as primary outcomes. Student’s t-tests and Chi-square (χ2) tests were used as inidicated, with logistic regression controlling for maternal age and number of embryos transferred.

Results
Three hundred forty three patients were identified for inclusion: 165 and 178 patients had 4-cell embryos with and without growth on the afternoon of ET, respectively. The demographic and baseline IVF cycle characteristics of the study cohort were comparable. Patients with embryo growth had higher clinical pregnancy (13.9 % vs. 4.49 %) and live birth (10.9 % vs. 3.37 %) rates compared to patients without embryo growth. This represented an overall increased odds of clinical pregnancy [Odds ratio (OR) = 3.44; 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.49–7.93; P = 0.004)] and live birth (OR = 3.51; 95 % CI 1.36–9.07; P = 0.01). The increased odds remained unchanged after adjusting for maternal age and number of embryos transferred.

Conclusions
Transfer of 4-cell embryos 3 days after oocyte retrieval can result in clinical pregnancies and live births, albeit at a low rate. Growth of an embryo more than the 4-cell stage on the afternoon of ET may serve as a positive prognostic factor for IVF-ET cycle outcome.

251,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Having surgery next week to excise endo after nearly a year of pain from giant cysts and a failed IVF cycle. I became really anemic because of the cysts (apparently they’re bleeding into themselves). The anemia apparently has caused a mild heart murmur that the anesthesiologist wanted checked out before surgery that was scheduled for today. 

Woke up to a snowstorm 😒, but blissfully my dad said he’d come get me. Roads were awful, but we made it there. The sonogram operator asked me when my surgery was, and then asked me in the most obnoxious voice if I was going to be able to get pregnant after the surgery. This is literally a huge fear of mine because we have no idea what impact the cysts may have had on my eggs, whether surgery will effect my reserves, or if I’ll lose an ovary (25% chance that I’ll lose at least one). I had no idea how to respond to her, I felt like I was going to either have a panic attack or punch her in the throat (I did neither). She took my silence to mean she could go on and tell me about a friend of hers that got pregnant right away after having an endo surgery and it’s super common and everyone has babies. This after all my drs agreed that my endo is particularly aggressive, but yeah, whatever, endo is the same for everyone. She was also NOT gentle with the probe. I understand she needed to get the image, but it felt like she was trying to snap a rib. Another tech had to come and get more images and did not read my chart or see my huge swollen belly and slammed the probe into my upper abdomen, and then said “oh, did that hurt?”. Not impressed by this entire department. 

Also, I started telling a few of my vendors and business associates at work that I was going on leave and arranging alternate contacts for them. Two of them straight up asked me if I was going on maternity leave. One just said “sooooo what’s up with you going on leave” in a super prying voice. These are not people from my company, just people I need work with once in a while (lawyers, vendors etc). I have no personal relationship with them and only 1/3 knows I’m even married because she was around when I changed my last name. 

As excited as I am to have this surgery, I also know that it means that we’re coming off the bench soon and potentially getting back onto the IVF train. Part of me is excited, and part of me is absolutely terrified to go through it again. It was physically one of the most painful things I’ve even endured (mostly due to the cysts), and definitely the most emotionally difficult. I don’t even know if I’ll get to use my eggs or if we’ll have to use donor eggs, though I guess we won’t know until a few weeks after surgery. 

Anyway, thanks if you made it to the end of this rant/ wall of text. Just felt like I was going to burst if I didn’t get it out.

I became really anemic because of the cysts (apparently they’re bleeding into themselves). The anemia apparently has caused a mild heart murmur that the anesthesiologist wanted checked out before surgery that was scheduled for today. </p>

<p>Woke up to a snowstorm 😒, but blissfully my dad said he’d come get me. Roads were awful, but we made it there. The sonogram operator asked me when my surgery was, and then asked me in the most obnoxious voice if I was going to be able to get pregnant after the surgery. This is literally a huge fear of mine because we have no idea what impact the cysts may have had on my eggs, whether surgery will effect my reserves, or if I’ll lose an ovary (25% chance that I’ll lose at least one). I had no idea how to respond to her, I felt like I was going to either have a panic attack or punch her in the throat (I did neither). She took my silence to mean she could go on and tell me about a friend of hers that got pregnant right away after having an endo surgery and it’s super common and everyone has babies. This after all my drs agreed that my endo is particularly aggressive, but yeah, whatever, endo is the same for everyone. She was also NOT gentle with the probe. I understand she needed to get the image, but it felt like she was trying to snap a rib. Another tech had to come and get more images and did not read my chart or see my huge swollen belly and slammed the probe into my upper abdomen, and then said “oh, did that hurt?”.

I had a suspected chemical pregnancy in March of last year and the doctor tested for Day 3 bloodwork during the cycle of the chemical pregnancy.  Fast forward a year later and I have changed doctors and clinics as well as labs. Basically, I'm starting over because I hated my doctor at Kaiser. She was such a bitch and didn't care at all about me. She thought I was too young to be worrying about getting pregnant. I'm 28 and I wanted a baby like 2 years ago.

 My new doctor, whom I love so far, wanted to repeat all of the tests including my husband's sperm analysis and my DAY 3 labs. I just got my results today and I don't see my doctor until Monday. I also had a follicular ultrasound done and I have fluid contrast ultrasound scheduled for next Monday as well. The doctor wants to discuss everything with me after she has all the testing done. The thing I am most worried about is that my AMH levels increased so much that I might now have PCOS.

I'm not looking to make a ton of money from this so compensation could be discussed if terms are agreed upon. I'm not available to donate again until Around October but if this interests anyone please let me know. I honestly just want to give the gift of life and have no foul intentions what-so-ever.

We only have one infertility clinic in the area and the nearest one after that is like an hour and a half a way. 

I have been wanting to maybe try another doctor because I just feel very disconnected from him throughout this process. All the appointments seem fast and all his answers seem very wishy washy. We have unexplained infertility, so some of the testing is optional. I don’t know if we should get a dye study done and he has made it seem kinda unnecessary. And I know I just want answers- it’s hard to not have an answer as to why we aren’t getting pregnant. Have any of you gone to a different doc and found different results?

<p>I have been wanting to maybe try another doctor because I just feel very disconnected from him throughout this process. All the appointments seem fast and all his answers seem very wishy washy. We have unexplained infertility, so some of the testing is optional. I don’t know if we should get a dye study done and he has made it seem kinda unnecessary. And I know I just want answers- it’s hard to not have an answer as to why we aren’t getting pregnant. Have any of you gone to a different doc and found different results?</p>

<p>We have done 2 iui’s with no success at this point. I know that’s not a lot, but we have to pay out of pocket for every treatment, so this is a slow going process. </p>

It's been a very long and painful road for my wife and I, heartbreak after heartbreak.  Losing hope with each negative beta.  Each one more painful than the one before it.  But for the first time since seeking medical help almost six years ago, we finally have an idea what's wrong, and more importantly, how to treat it.

After 13 IUIs, three chemical pregnancies, one m/c, four separate IVF stim cycles and egg retrievals, three cancelled and six failed embryo transfers, and six more embryos lost to PGS testing we are not left with much hope nor prospects for a sucessful outcome.  My wife has been through multiple RPL panels, a littany of bloodwork and testing, keryotyping, biopsy after biopsy.  We treated for a mild endometritis infection.  But everything seemed within an acceptable range.  We tried a natural FET.  She tried increasing her lining with viagra and supplements.  Since graduating from IUI to IVF, never even the faintest hint of HCG, always zero.  

We long suspected that we had an implantation issue, even before we started PGS testing embryos to confirm this.  My wifes lining is somewhat thin, but usually in the 7.5 to 8 range, which should be enough, especially after multiple tries.  We suspected there might be adhesions left over from a D&C done after a heartbreaking misscarriage at 11 weeks.  That was IUI number 9, and was due to Trisomy 13.  Perhaps the saline sonos had missed something, but no, a hysteroscopy confirmed everything was completely normal.  Next, we suspected a timing issue, however the ERA  test is not licensed in our state.  While we were starting down the path of planning an out of state excusion to have the ERA biopsy done, our doctor suggested that we do a receptiva DX test since this cycle was going to be a wash anyway.  A week after what was described as a most excrutiatingly painful biopsy, the results came back and we got a hit.  She scored 3.7 out of 4.  Endometriosis.  While this score doesnt necessarily corolate to the severity of the Endo, it does mean theres a very high likelihood that there is indeed Endo.  Finally, we have an answer as to why.

We never thought Endo was a very likely possibility.  In all honesty, despite how common it is, we dismissed entirely it early on.  My wife does not have particularly painful nor heavy periods.  While perhaps not very enjoyable (my fault, I know) intercourse was never painful.  We have a previous history of pregnancy.  Nothing seemed to point in that direction, yet here we have it staring us right in the face.  The BCL-6 cutoff for normal is below 1.4, and she has a 3.7.  The beta3 integrin test cutoff is above .75, and we had a .25.  But how could this be?  Has she always had it?  Was it caused by the D&C?  Perhaps her cessarian incision healed with uterine tissue on the outside?  I guess it makes sense that it's always been there.  Endo doesnt necessarily mean 100% infertility.  It could well be the reason fertility was so difficult just before it became impossible.  Perhaps the insanely high levels of estrogen during repeated IVF cycles have fed it, making matters worse.

As expected Our doctor suggested two months of Lupron Depot, and then right into a medicated FET.  We have two PSG normal embryos remaining.  Another failure will push us towards an out of state ERA test, and possibly persuing immunologic issues.  But for now, we just want to get through the next two months of medicated temporary menopause, and go into the next cycle with renewed optimism. 

Ive done as much research as I can regarding Endo here, in the endo sub, and out there in the googles.  Still theres a lot of missed or conflicting information.  I would love to hear any suggestions anyone might be able to add.

While our doctor is not recommending prednisone, she is not averse to the idea.  Is there any reason to suspect additional immunologic issues at play?  My wife has well controlled hypothyroidism (non hasimotos), which leads me to believe it could be a possibility.  Ive seen others here add Letrozole / Femara, which was not prescribed.  I know that two big names in the immunologic infertility area are fans of an anti-inflammatory diet (gluten free, lactose free, etc).  Are there any opinions as to if this is more fact or fiction?

Lastly, how long a window do we have after a 2 month Lupron treatment?  I guess this is different for every case, especially since we are not doing a lap to excise the endometriosis, or even inspect how prevalent it is.  I have to assume that the endo will slowly come back, as soon as estrogen is re-introduced, but does it happen within weeks?  Months?  A year perhaps?  Its  the one quiestion I neglected to ask our doctor last we spoke.

Just had my first ER yesterday and I felt beyond prepared...just wanted to thank this unbelievably strong and educated community for that.

My husband and I work in research and I found this article after reviewing my pre-retrieval labs.  It is a few years old but I thought was helpful with putting into perspective how progesterone may play a role not only in implantation but also at the time of retrieval.  The focus is in an antagonist protocol.

http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)03282-2/fulltext

I think what hit home for me with it was the clinical consideration with looking at progesterone levels at the day of oocyte retrieval and using that to make a decision about fresh vs frozen transfer.  I think so much we hear about E2/estrogen being a big influence (esp with OHSS) with deciding on a fresh or frozen transfer but this was the first I had read about progesterone (I am also a newbie to this so apologies if this is old news).

I also thought that it was interesting that they suggest possibly considering continued dosing with an antagonist post-retrieval to keep progesterone levels down?  I thought most protocols start PIO injections pretty quickly?  Again I could just be confused and new to all of this so my apologies if I am missing the plot.

I hope this is helpful in supporting this unbelievably resilient community that I am extremely happy to have found in this unfortunate journey.

Cycle #4 is [pretty consistent](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7zdpmm/thursday_active_treatment_thread/dunrbgd/)

But this time they've asked me to up my Gonal-F to 450IU from 375IU.  I'm obviously very concerned about quality (although I suspect that some of it is male factor so nothing I do will fix that).  In *theory* the increase in menopur in Cycle #2 decreased quality (but I really think it was just lottery).

My concern is if increasing the Gonal-F will negatively effect egg quality? What are the theories on increasing the gonadotropin?  I stim long so I also wonder if it's just an attempt to get me to retrieval sooner.

Thanks for any thoughts/science :)

I don&#39;t expect them to put their family building on hold for me... but don&#39;t act like you care about my feelings, or hope that I get pregnant first, without even giving me a chance!  I don&#39;t have a shot at getting pregnant every month like she does.</p>

<p>Further spurring my rage:  My husband and I had planned a trip to Disney, which is coming up next month.  We had dreamed that we might be able to wear pregnancy announcement shirts at the magic kingdom.  Well, my sister in law decided to now also go to Disney the same time as us.... and SHE will get to wear the pregnancy shirt and dress her daughter up in an &quot;I&#39;m going to be a big sister&quot; shirt.  I&#39;m so angry and jealous and hurt.  I trusted my sister in law and wish she had just had the courtesy of at least telling me that they were trying.  I wish she was transparent about her plans :-(</p>

296,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I thought I'd share our recent experience with a longer HGH protocol and our subsequent improved embryo quality. Remember, these are just my observations and how things worked for us, but maybe this info can help someone else.


**background**

We have severe MFI: original SA's were in the 200,000 range, now at about 1.7 million. No known female issues for me except for controlled hypothyroidism. I started IVF at 36 and now am 38, so that probably doesn't help either. 

We've done 9 retrievals - you can [see our detailed hunger games info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7yxav3/lpt_first_time_ivf_ladies_get_emotionally_ready/duk5hca/). For all except our first 2 cycles, my husband has taken Ovidrel (hcg) every 3 days in the weeks before and during stims in an effort to boost testosterone.


**previous clinics/protocols**

In short, our first clinic we did two fresh transfers using Gonal/Luveris/Cetrotide, and the second led to an MC at 12 weeks. No PGS in that clinic so we left.

Our second clinic did PGS on day 3 with transfer on day 5 (known to be less accurate, but we never had anything freeze on day 5). We did 4 batching cycles with them all frozen on day 3. They had switched me to menopur and retrieval numbers were way down. I'm convinced the extra LH was a problem. We also used HGH on me starting on stims day 1 for all cycles. After all that, only one out of about 5 or 6 embryos on Day 5 was normal and that transfer failed. On to a new clinic.


**current clinic**

We've done 3 retrievals at our current clinic. It's a huge clinic with its own PGS lab, and I believe lab quality has also made a big difference for us.  All 3 protocols were microdose lupron protocols with Pergoveris, which is like menopur but a 2:1 ratio of FSH:LH instead of 1:1. And Ovidrel trigger.
For all 3 cycles we froze on Day 5 (or 6) and then PGS. 

Our first two cycles in our new clinic, I used HGH only during stims. We had a 50% normal rate - 3 of 6 total blasts tested normal. Our last FET failed.

For our most recent stim cycle, my RE had both me AND my husband on HGH for 10 weeks before retrieval. He actually wanted 3 months, but was ok with 10 weeks. I took .33mg daily and my husband took .5mg daily. I believe the clinic uses these as their standard female/male doses. 

In our previous two cycles at this clinic, we had 33% of our fertilized eggs make it to blast (12>4, and 6>2). This most recent cycle was 43% - so 3 of 7 fertilized were frozen. The biggest difference was that all 3 came back as PGS normal. We couldn't believe that we had a 100% normal rate, after two cycles with a 50% normal rate. 

Getting 3 normals in a single cycle of 7 fertilized, versus getting 3 normals from 18 fertilized across two cycles is a huge difference. I strongly suspect that the main difference must have been the HGH's effect, especially on the sperm quality.



**Here's everything we did differently this last cycle:**

-10 weeks of HGH for both partners, finished the night before retrieval

-I was put on Metformin (500 twice a day) since August in an effort to keep polyps at bay

-I took 3mg of melatonin every night during stims only. Here's [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209073/)

-we both took Acai supplements daily for 3+ months before retrieval based on [this study](https://www.ccrmivf.com/blog/ccrm-study-finds-that-high-doses-of-acai-berry-can-improve-ivf-outcomes/) 

-I lost some weight, about 15lbs.

-Added some other supplements (see below)

-Acupuncture. First 6 visits were 2 days apart, now I go every two weeks. I had one visit during stims.



**We've both always taken a variety of supplements including:**

-COQ10 (both)

-Vit E (both)

-selenium (both)

-Vit D (both)

-prenatal (me)

-B-complex (him)

-Zinc (him)

-L-carnitine (him)

-folic acid (both)

-Omega 3/fish oil (both)


**In the last few months we added in,**

-tart cherry juice pills for antioxidant value (both)

-lycopene (both)

-NAC (me)

-Alphalipoic acid (me)

-acai (both)

&nbsp;

I am remaining on HGH until transfer next month, as there are [studies that show success rates are improved](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101995)

&nbsp;

TL;DR: Severe MFI. We previously had two stim cycles with 33% of fertilized embryos making it to blasts and only 50% of those were PGS normal. For those, only I (female partner) took HGH during stims. However, our latest cycle had 42% fert>blast rate and 100% were normal, after both partners were on HGH for 10 weeks before retrieval.

I was commiserating with some other IF buddies recently about our recent failures and how we had really been struggling to ""switch off"" and relax, when we have the downtime. Our minds are always on our shitty IF situations, and it's really been tough to distract ourselves.

The conversation went on with a few of us saying we wished that there was a website like [Does the Dog Die](http://doesthedogdie.com) to tell us what movies, TV shows, books, entertainment etc there is out there that wouldn't upset us. So many things these days have pregnancy/infertility storylines and despite being an eternal optimist, I've been finding IVF round 2 particularly emotional and difficult to deal with.

I've always made random websites so I said I'd look into creating something where we could have safe stuff listed so that others can know they're not going to be blindsided. 

I'm planning to add categories for TV, Films, Video Games, Books, and also have an infertility section with media that has excellent portrayals of infertility, for those feeling strong enough to watch those (How To Buy A Baby, etc).

What I'm seeking really is any input into what you'd want to see on this site (suggestions for categories etc)? And I'd also appreciate any early submissions to get the ball rolling.

Also, any site name suggestions?

Thoughts appreciated! <3 to everyone.

**Edited to add**: Also, would you like it to be a searchable resource of what to avoid? Or just a good resource of ""safe"" things? Thanks!

Here is Version 2.0 so we can continue the process.

The Hunger Games is what we lovingly call the time period from retrieval to Day 5/6. Basically the eggs retrieved are tributes and the ones who make it to Day 5-6 are victors. It's a hard, emotionally shitty process. On average, 70% of mature eggs will fertilize. 50-70% of the fertilized embryos will make it to day 3 and 50-70% of those will make it to day 5/6. The ones that make it to Day 5/6 are blastocysts and are the ones that get transferred to the uterus in most cases.

**Example** 

* 10 mature eggs are retrieved

* 7 will fertilize

* 4 will make it to day 3

* 3 will make it to day 5

These are just averages. Some people get 100% fert rates and some people get 0%. This is the same for blast rates.

If you have cycled before, post your stats in the comments so others have an idea of the range of possibilities.

Prolly a few hunge.&#39;</p>

<p>I wonder if any of you lovely folk could outline what you did in fact receive back for in/outpatient fees, prescriptions, etc? And which fund you were with? My insurance will pay the &#39;scheduled fee&#39; for the surgeon and anaesthetist, and up to $600 for medications (but they won&#39;t give me a list of the ones that are covered, I have to wait til they&#39;re prescribed and submit receipts). They also cover the hospital admission fees minus an excess. THat does not sound like it&#39;ll add up to being worthwhile.</p>
