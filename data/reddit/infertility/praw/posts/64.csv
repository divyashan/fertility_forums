Back before I was diagnosed with PCOS I would notice sometimes my body would gear up to ovulate and then just fail. It's done the same this month.
I'd produce EWCM, my cervix would be high and open and my OPKs would be just a tiny shade away from being positive - and then nothing. The OPK would never turn positive, my EWCM would turn thicker and less stretchy and that would be the end of it and I'd be taking Provera days later to induce a flow.


Last Clomid cycle I O'd on CD19 which was great for me. On unmedicated cycles, when my PCOS is allowing my ovaries to work, I usually ovulate around CD23. I was super stoked that I had ovulated 4-5 days sooner than normal. I can't even imagine being one of these women that ovulates on CD14. Most of them will never realise how lucky they are (Provided they have no other fertility issues of course)


I feel super disappointed that my body has failed me this month. I know some women will miss ovulation and then a few days, to a week later their body will 'try again' but mine doesn't do this. Mine just fails to ovulate and then gets stuck on standby until my womb lining needs to break down and I have a bleed. (I had a cycle last year that lasted for nearly 100 days and at no point did I ovulate)

Ovulation is very hit and miss for me. I've recently had a clean slate of ovulating every month for 3 months in a row but this month I haven't, and I might not ovulate again (Without help) for another 3-4 months or so, or maybe I'll ovulate again next cycle and again for the next four.
I recently had an ultrasound where they remarked that I had no symptoms of PCOS present, however I had a scan about 8 months ago after my 100 day cycle and they said PCOS was very evident. I figure this is because when my body was failing to release eggs it was causing the PCOS to show up. When I do release eggs for a few months in a row, no PCOS shows on my scans or in my blood work.

There aren’t a lot of fertility doctors out there, and when you find one, you don’t have too many options in a reasonable distance from your house. It’s such a specialized practice that most people won’t know the right questions to ask and blindly trust their doctor. After all, they are your doctor and should have your best interest first. I’ve been seen by 3 different places myself (I moved) and I have friends who have shared their similar experiences. If you would like to add to this, please feel free. 

Your doctor should meet with you first, talk about your options, the tests they want to run and what you should expect from their office. This is your time to ask whatever questions you have about infertility. Don’t feel intimidated by new phrases and words they use. 

When you’re starting a cycle, you should have a sonogram, bloodwork, and a follow up at each appointment. Or just bloodwork or follow up. Some places like to have the doctor sit with you after your blood/sono and then call later in the day with instructions, some just call later. But they should be keeping you in the loop. Negative stories I’ve experienced and have heard about, consist of doctors sitting with you after your appointment just to tell you they don’t know anything yet and a nurse will call later. Which is fine some of the time, but you should not have to pay for a consult when they are having a 30 second meeting with you telling you someone will call. 

They should call when they say they’re going to with medication instructions when needed. Most of the cycle your dosage will stay the same, but they should set a clear expectation that they will call you if anything changes. Dosage adjustments are crucial to your cycle, and I’ve heard way too many clinics who forget to call and then tell you the following appointment what you should have done. 

The staff should not be rude to you. This goes for any medical practice and humans in general, but I’ve sadly experienced this first hand. For example, I’ve had sonogram techs that I loved, but  I’ve also  had one woman who wouldn’t make small talk, would cut me off when I tried talking and would open the door and walk in before asking if I was dressed. I had to ask if I did something to offend her because she was always just really rude to me. She wouldn’t even look up at me while I spoke. You’re going to see these people almost every single morning for a good amount of time. You shouldn’t have to feel uncomfortable by rude staff. 

If your cycle doesn’t work, you have every right to ask questions. And you have every right to request additional testing. Do your research and make a list of questions to ask. They see so many people a day that they aren’t looking out for you the same way you are. I’m not saying they don’t care, I’m saying you know yourself and your body best. 

Please don’t think all places are bad. I’ve been to awesome ones who I miss dearly.

It&#39;s tricky to find good support - especially after I was used to the fiercely compassionate and delightfully irreverent folks in this group. So here&#39;s a thread for those looking for support or answers about the adoption process. </p>

Pre-FET I got a lupron depot shot (late May) which I was told would ""turn off"" my ovaries for up to 6 weeks and possibly help with implantation. I read online that a bunch of women had majorly delayed periods even after a single shot before a FET and heavily pushed back since failing that FET would mean stimming again. But my RE was adamant that if there was a delay, it would only be a week or two. So anyway, fuck him. I have never had a delayed period in my life until now, so I'm beyond annoyed.

Now I'm on CD 70-something. A few weeks ago I did 5 days of oral progesterone to induce a period, and waited two weeks. Nothing. On that 14th day after the last oral progesterone pills, they told me to do a single 50mg PIO shot and I should have my period in 5 to 7 days. That was Wednesday last week so now it's been 8 days. Nothing again.

I'm at my wit's end. My new RE is saying I can now switch to estrogen patches and then add in progesterone, and expect a period to start in exactly 3 weeks from the first patch day. Which would put me in a TWW for my brother's wedding which totally sucks. But at this point, if I wait more than a few more days, it could put my transfer very  close to the actual wedding date and I don't want that. And for a variety of reasons and conflicts, we aren't going to delay an extra month.

Has anyone had this situation before and done something that was faster than three weeks? I'm desperate to see if maybe there is some other option she's not considering. I thought I read people doing 12 days of BCP and inducing a period withing a few days after that which would be much better.

BACKGROUND:

I have done two retrievals and have three PGS normals.  I would strongly prefer to not do any more retrievals if at all possible.

I was in the process of prepping for an FET when a hysteroscopy last week showed I have a polyp.  My RE is recommending that we remove it before proceeding with an FET.

It is suspected that I have endometriosis, due to my own symptoms and the fact that my mother and sister have it (both confirmed via surgery).  My RE had offered to do an exploratory laparoscopy when we first started treatment in 2015 to confirm, but said he’d recommend proceeding with treatment whether or not I had endo, so I decided to avoid the surgery.

I have a history of miscarriage at 8 weeks, which would seem to indicate implantation is possible. 


QUESTION:

Since I’d like to do everything possible to avoid additional retrievals and because the polyp removal will occur in the hospital under general anesthesia, does it make sense to ask for a laparoscopy at the same time to check for and remove any endo?  I have read several studies that seem to indicate that fertility improves after initial endo surgery, and I figure if I already have to have the polyp removed, it won’t be much harder to get the endo taken care of at the same time (if it’s there).  (I am aware that endo surgery involving the ovaries themselves can reduce fertility, but I’m not as worried about that as I am about potential implantation issues for my embryos due to the endo.)

Any thoughts you all have would be much appreciated!  Thanks!

44,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"We (shared account) haven't posted an update on our situation in some time, but figured now would be a good time to get some outside opinions.  A quick glance at our flare will show that we've been through the ringer for sure, and while the future has brightened a little, we're gonna have to push through a bit more regardless of the outcome.

Historically, we've done 13 IUIs, and got positive betas every third one, until IUI9 which was a MMC at 10 weeks.  4 more failed IUIs led us right to IVF.  So far, IVF has proven to be a near complete and utter clusterfuck of epic proportions for us.  Out of 5 IVF cycles, 3 fresh transfers and 5 FETs (3 PGS), we have only had one single chemical pregnancy.  A very poor return by anyone's standard.

We had a positive ReceptivaDX hit last year, and treated with 2 months of lupron depot, followed by a letrizole FET which resulted in our only CP/positive beta.  A subsequent FET with the same protocol and our last PGS tested embryo was flatly negative.  We pushed ahead with IVF number 5, and got two big beautiful 6AA blasts, but sadly both were abnormal.

Needing a break, and having long suspected an implantation timing issue, we perused the ERA out of state.  The result was pre-receptive by about a day.  That translates to being off by 36 hours since our clinic has you do injections in the evening, resulting in roughly 108 hours of progesterone.  This makes so much sense, since we seemed to be much closer to success with natural and IUI cycles.  The rigid timing of IVF presumably did not allow the embryos to survive to implant, where as the natural aberration would occasionally allow for it.

One step forward, but another step back; we repeated the ReceptivaDX test at the same time as the ERA, and unfortunately it came back positive again.  We knew this might happen with the higher estrogen levels with another IVF cycle.

In the meantime my beautiful wife and I celebrated her 40th birthday.  Hooray!  A sobering reminder of the looming time constraints.  But on the positive, two recent AMH tests done three days apart put her AMA and 1.44 and 1.97 depending on which lab you believe.  The 1.97 result was from the same lab that gave us a 1.99 result two years earlier.

In the off cycle, I did a semen analysis and DNA fragmentation test.   The DNA came back very low, which is great.  The semen analysis was less than stellar.  Great counts and overall motility.  Strict morphology and forward progression came back borderline to low.  In discussion with a number of doctors, they all seem to think its fine.  Everyone seems to prefer darwin over ICSI wherever possible, and I tend to agree in trusting a zona pellucida over a stabby embryologist in terms of sperm selection.  Regardless, our fertilization rates have historically been 90% to 100% for the last three cycles.  All the same, I'm making whatever lifestyle and supplement changes and additions I can, since it can only help.  I have plans to meet with a reproductive urologist to check for vericocele, if one will ever return my phone call.  But I digress..

Last night, we met with a fantastic doctor we have had the privilege of working with in the past, although he was never our primary.  He has since left our clinic to start his own practice in conjunction with the local university hospital.  He spent quite a lot of time with us last night, and really dove into our case and our options.  It was great to finally dig in to the minutia with him.  Jumping ship to this new clinic would be a no-brainer if it weren't for one very big problem.  The embryology lab and OR buildout is still a long way from being complete.  He thinks 2 to 3 months.  I think it looks like it will be closer to 6 months.  Regardless, who wants to be the first trial run?   The benefits are that the new lab will be all brand new state of the art equipment, and many of the best staff from the old clinic has left for the new one.  The downsides are the wait time before  they are up and running, and the embryologists familiarity with new equipment.  There is a temporary workaround under negotiation to have access to another facility for IVF procedures, but its yet to be finalized, and comes with its own set of concerns.

Moving forward, we will be doing our 14th IUI this month, because insurance covers it, and well, why not?  That means its also the first time we can try naturally in OVER TWO YEARS.  Jumping back into IVF becomes a more complicated matter.  We have exhausted our very generous insurance maximum coverage, and will be paying out of pocket for IVF procedures from this point forward.  Luckily meds will still be covered, which we are still very grateful for.  If we continue with our current old clinic, they will likely just throw us back on the same old boring protocol, hope to get the 12 to 15 eggs we normally get, hopefully resulting in a couple embryos, and if our luck improves, maybe a PGS normal or two.  Then its right into 2 months of lupron, and finally a letrozole FET on the correct day finally.

The doctor at the new clinic had some more exotic ideas; perhaps using additional or all menopur / less fsh, or possibly trying a long lupron protocol, just to see if the egg quality can be improved.  Our cycles have been all over the place, and nobody is quite sure why.  Our last three IVF results have been 0/4, 3/5, 0/2 PGS normals.  He wants to try to improve on this.  The old clinic wants more of the same.

The last paragraph gives us some choices on how to get embryos, but we still have to put them back in, and we cant do that till we figure out what to do about the endo.  Firstly, do we care?  We have a history of pregnancy and implantation, and if  you presume that endo has been prevalent the entire time, it didnt preclude implantation in the past.  In this case, the ERA is the bigger picture, and once we correct the transfer day, were in good shape!  But since the ERA is not available in our state, EVERY doctor is extremely skeptical about the benefits, or trusting the results at all.  Now assuming we do very much indeed care about the endo, we can either wait and do another 2 months of lupron after the next IVF cycle resulting in PGS normals, or we can do lap surgery.  Normally I wouldn't even consider the surgery, but if we decide  to wait for  the new clinic buildout to complete, maybe surgery would be a good use of our time?  Then when we finally do IVF, we can jump right back into a FET the next month without lupron.  For me, a lot of this decision will rest on what our most recent score was.  We had a 3.7 last year, and I suspect it will be back around there, but have not yet heard the final number.

And lastly, the doctor at the new clinic brought up another option, perhaps as a stopgap measure until the buildout is complete, or perhaps indefinitely.  He suggested trying medicated IUI cycles, since we had a reasonable clinical pregnancy rate with IUI in the past.  The idea being that aiming for 2 or 3 eggs per cycle is reasonable at our age, since the aneuploidy rate will make multiples unlikely, at least past the first trimester.  Maybe we'll get lucky.  The difficulty here is that the new lab will still not be ready for IUI.  We would have to suggest doing this at our old clinic.

So there you have it.  The latest in this four year epic saga.  I pray it does not last another four years.  If anyone has any thoughts or opinions on any of this, we're very interested in hearing it.  Then go give your poor eyeballs a rest.

Endo lap vs lupron again?",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_9fja28,False,dark,0.99,,public,7,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,,False,False,,{},,False,7,,self,False,,{},,True,,1536883515.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We (shared account) haven&#39;t posted an update on our situation in some time, but figured now would be a good time to get some outside opinions.  A quick glance at our flare will show that we&#39;ve been through the ringer for sure, and while the future has brightened a little, we&#39;re gonna have to push through a bit more regardless of the outcome.</p>

<p>Historically, we&#39;ve done 13 IUIs, and got positive betas every third one, until IUI9 which was a MMC at 10 weeks.  4 more failed IUIs led us right to IVF.  So far, IVF has proven to be a near complete and utter clusterfuck of epic proportions for us.  Out of 5 IVF cycles, 3 fresh transfers and 5 FETs (3 PGS), we have only had one single chemical pregnancy.  A very poor return by anyone&#39;s standard.</p>

<p>We had a positive ReceptivaDX hit last year, and treated with 2 months of lupron depot, followed by a letrizole FET which resulted in our only CP/positive beta.  A subsequent FET with the same protocol and our last PGS tested embryo was flatly negative.  We pushed ahead with IVF number 5, and got two big beautiful 6AA blasts, but sadly both were abnormal.</p>

<p>Needing a break, and having long suspected an implantation timing issue, we perused the ERA out of state.  The result was pre-receptive by about a day.  That translates to being off by 36 hours since our clinic has you do injections in the evening, resulting in roughly 108 hours of progesterone.  This makes so much sense, since we seemed to be much closer to success with natural and IUI cycles.  The rigid timing of IVF presumably did not allow the embryos to survive to implant, where as the natural aberration would occasionally allow for it.</p>

<p>One step forward, but another step back; we repeated the ReceptivaDX test at the same time as the ERA, and unfortunately it came back positive again.  We knew this might happen with the higher estrogen levels with another IVF cycle.</p>

<p>In the meantime my beautiful wife and I celebrated her 40th birthday.  Hooray!  A sobering reminder of the looming time constraints.  But on the positive, two recent AMH tests done three days apart put her AMA and 1.44 and 1.97 depending on which lab you believe.  The 1.97 result was from the same lab that gave us a 1.99 result two years earlier.</p>

<p>In the off cycle, I did a semen analysis and DNA fragmentation test.   The DNA came back very low, which is great.  The semen analysis was less than stellar.  Great counts and overall motility.  Strict morphology and forward progression came back borderline to low.  In discussion with a number of doctors, they all seem to think its fine.  Everyone seems to prefer darwin over ICSI wherever possible, and I tend to agree in trusting a zona pellucida over a stabby embryologist in terms of sperm selection.  Regardless, our fertilization rates have historically been 90% to 100% for the last three cycles.  All the same, I&#39;m making whatever lifestyle and supplement changes and additions I can, since it can only help.  I have plans to meet with a reproductive urologist to check for vericocele, if one will ever return my phone call.  But I digress..</p>

<p>Last night, we met with a fantastic doctor we have had the privilege of working with in the past, although he was never our primary.  He has since left our clinic to start his own practice in conjunction with the local university hospital.  He spent quite a lot of time with us last night, and really dove into our case and our options.  It was great to finally dig in to the minutia with him.  Jumping ship to this new clinic would be a no-brainer if it weren&#39;t for one very big problem.  The embryology lab and OR buildout is still a long way from being complete.  He thinks 2 to 3 months.  I think it looks like it will be closer to 6 months.  Regardless, who wants to be the first trial run?   The benefits are that the new lab will be all brand new state of the art equipment, and many of the best staff from the old clinic has left for the new one.  The downsides are the wait time before  they are up and running, and the embryologists familiarity with new equipment.  There is a temporary workaround under negotiation to have access to another facility for IVF procedures, but its yet to be finalized, and comes with its own set of concerns.</p>

My story is that we've been trying for years now and we're finally ready to start pursuing adoption.
Disclaimer: I know that the different ways we all approach and pursue parenthood are each deeply personal and that adoption certainly isn't for everyone. /enddisclaimer

My problem is that after finding the great support system in r/stilltrying and r/infertility I thought it'd be at least similar if I subscribed to a community about adoption. However, the only one I can find seems to be a support system primarily for those who were adopted and who are traumatized by the experience. The only interactions I've found have been rife with embittered souls who think adoption is horrible, who think terminating a pregnancy is the only humane way to deal with a situation where the mother can't/won't parent. And I know that decisions revolving around how to handle pregnancies are also intensely personal, but my opinion is that all life is sacred. I do not mean to offend anyone but I will also never change that belief.

My question is whether any of you know of a subreddit or online community for individuals who don't think adoption is evil. Maybe that's individuals who were adopted and are glad to share what that means to them: good and bad, or adopted parents who are able to give advice. I don't mean to criticize that community, but it's obviously not for me, and I would very much like one.

Last IVF this summer (which ended in a CP) I stimmed for 10 days before my lead follicle reached 18mm. However because I had a cyst that needed to be aspirated at the beginning of the cycle, and due to endometriosis, my doctor wanted to switch to a long Lupron this cycle--I guess she hopes it will prevent any cyst at the beginning of my next cycle. 


But I'm worried because I have DOR--only 6 follicles grew and 2 were fertilized last time, so I'm wondering if Lupron will make things even worse, and possibly have even fewer follicles grow--is that how Lupron works?


The last thing is I'm wondering if Lupron makes you stim for longer, as a general rule. My doctor said we should expect the same length of stims as last time, 10 days, but that seems off to me--everything I've read about Lupron is that it puts you into temporary menopause. So logically, wouldn't the stims not work as quickly, compared with not starting out at ""menopause""? 


It wouldn't be much of a concern except I'm going abroad for IVF, and my dr doesn't want to recommend how many days to allow for stims; she just says it'll be similar to last time. So I'm leaning towards 11 days just in case, but I'm curious if others have experienced a similar switch in protocols, and if their stims were significantly slowed down because of the Lupron.

thanks in advance!

Our fertilization report the next day was miserable – 3 mature and only 1 fertilized normally via ICSI. That one somehow made it to blast and transferred but didn’t take. 

My RE didn’t do my retrieval himself, and in fact I didn’t hear from him personally until after my negative beta. At that point, I asked about them being stuck and he muttered something about “I don’t know, maybe it was the endometriosis” and then encouraged me to make an appointment with him if/when we want to cycle again to discuss what we can do differently.

The stirrups are the only sign that this isn’t a spa.

CNY Fertility Center is one of the busiest fertility clinics in the country, with four locations in Upstate New York and another soon to open in Atlanta. It’s also among the most affordable.

CNY is part of a small number of fertility clinics that charge a fraction of what other clinics do for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Doctors at these clinics argue that a high-volume, low-cost fertility program can make money, help start new families and open the market to people who otherwise couldn’t afford IVF. Insurance usually doesn’t fully cover these types of procedures.

...

Robert Kiltz, the 62-year-old owner and director of the fertility clinic, says CNY charges $3,900 for one cycle of IVF. That’s about a third of the national average cost.

CNY patients must also pay for medications, monitoring and sometimes a frozen embryo transfer, bringing the total average cost to about $8,000 a cycle. That compares with a U.S. average of $20,700, as calculated by FertilityIQ, which has verified patient reviews of more than 400 fertility clinics. Its data come from more than 10,000 patients who have had IVF performed over the past 18 months.

The more than 190 IVF patients at CNY report a household income of $85,000 a year, compared with $182,000 nationally, according to FertilityIQ. Nearly 20% earn less than $50,000 a year, compared with just 4% nationally.

I say it's unique, because I have yet to find anyone else who is dealing or has dealt with this, and I have only found a couple of articles addressing it. First, a little backstory... My husband and I have been struggling with infertility for the past 6 years. We have been to several doctors, including fertility specialists, and they have not been able to find anything that is causing our fertility issues. I suffered two mc's during the first couple of years of our TTC journey. Fast forward to a couple of years ago... I started suffering from some minor allergies randomly. It was just a stuffy nose that would last for a few hours and then go away. Gradually, it got worse, and I started noticing a pattern. These allergies were only happening during the first couple of days or so of my period, and again during ovulation. Now, the allergies are so bad it feels like I have a bad cold (runny nose, stuffy nose, sinus pressure and headache, watery red eyes, sore throat, etc). I also had these allergies with both of my pregnancies (although they weren't this severe). I have tried so many different allergy meds, to no avail. Nothing gives me any relief. Anyway, I have been hesitant to go to the dr, because I couldn't find any info on it when I would google my issues. Thankfully, my husband found an [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658477/) the other day that describes what I'm going through exactly.  Apparently, all signs point to an autoimmune allergy. As you can see from the article, aside from the allergy symptoms I'm suffering from, infertility is also a symptom/side effect.

We met with a reproductive endocrinologist and he said that we can try IUI but would only have a 3-5% success rate and the best move would probably be IVF with ICSI. He gave us a 50% success rate for IVF and 60% if two embryos are transferred. He also referred us to the best urologist in state who specializes in male infertility (my husband has a varicocele which might be causing his low numbers).

117,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"In case flair doesn't show up:  **38F, TTC 15mos, DOR, 1st IUI** 

Since I'm new at this I wanted to see how unusual my situation is right now. After TTC for a year my ob/gyn told me to stop wasting my time and referred me to a fertility clinic out on Long Island, NY (I live in Queens and that is where said doctor is located as well). My initial consult went well and gave me a lot of hope, RE was personable and the clinic saw me on time. Did the entire workup over the course of one month which was very physically taxing (blood tests, saline sono, HSG, husband's semen analysis etc) and everything was normal except for my AMH of .6. 

When I came in for my saline sono they made me wait about 2hrs which was a drag, but I didn't think anything of it until I returned with my husband to go over treatment options. We waited 90mins to talk to the RE and she proceeded for a second time to explain human reproduction to us like we were in kindergarten. I rolled my eyes and just went with it, didn't want to be rude. I was then told my only option is to try IUI as soon as possible. She proceeded to put forth a timed schedule of monitoring based on my cycle that I can not complete due to my job. I'm a freelancer in the entertainment industry and when I am working as I am now until March of 2019 I can not take any days off that are not already scheduled. I don't get sick days or paid time off and am the primary financial provider. My health insurance (which does not cover infertility at all btw) is also tied to my working a certain number of hours every quarter. So when I explained to her that I couldn't try treatment until I get some time off in Dec/Jan she became angry and said something about me being difficult. Of course this made me very angry and she exasperatingly put together an IUI plan to try to throw off my ovulation so that I could come in when I have time off in late Sept. She put me on birth control pills for a week and a half and I'm supposed to do 5 days of Clomid 2x/day before going in for the IUI. She told me that this most likely wouldn't work and when I asked why I'm paying them $1200 for ""barely a chance"" she couldn't give me a straight answer. In fact, she couldn't really tell me much of anything. I had questions for the nurses at this clinic and can never get one on the phone, they are always in meetings and call me back when I'm unable to answer. They will only return your call 1x. The empathy shown during my initial consult was gone leaving me feeling like I had received a very rehearsed sales pitch.

Does anybody else in this community have an unusually demanding career that takes priority? I feel like I need to find a better fertility clinic after this IUI cycle. I did some googling and the reviews are pretty bad. I feel like if I'm paying this much  money to do this they need to work with me. It's a catch-22 - if I lose my job bc of infertility I can't pay for treatment and lose all my health insurance anyway, not to mention my income and reputation. I was only able to do the workup and initial consult in such a timely manner because I had the time off. I don't feel like I'm being treated in an acceptable manner. If this is what's expected I will not be continuing with assisted reproductive services.

<p>Since I&#39;m new at this I wanted to see how unusual my situation is right now. After TTC for a year my ob/gyn told me to stop wasting my time and referred me to a fertility clinic out on Long Island, NY (I live in Queens and that is where said doctor is located as well). My initial consult went well and gave me a lot of hope, RE was personable and the clinic saw me on time. Did the entire workup over the course of one month which was very physically taxing (blood tests, saline sono, HSG, husband&#39;s semen analysis etc) and everything was normal except for my AMH of .6. </p>

<p>When I came in for my saline sono they made me wait about 2hrs which was a drag, but I didn&#39;t think anything of it until I returned with my husband to go over treatment options. We waited 90mins to talk to the RE and she proceeded for a second time to explain human reproduction to us like we were in kindergarten. I rolled my eyes and just went with it, didn&#39;t want to be rude. I was then told my only option is to try IUI as soon as possible. She proceeded to put forth a timed schedule of monitoring based on my cycle that I can not complete due to my job. I&#39;m a freelancer in the entertainment industry and when I am working as I am now until March of 2019 I can not take any days off that are not already scheduled. I don&#39;t get sick days or paid time off and am the primary financial provider. My health insurance (which does not cover infertility at all btw) is also tied to my working a certain number of hours every quarter. So when I explained to her that I couldn&#39;t try treatment until I get some time off in Dec/Jan she became angry and said something about me being difficult. Of course this made me very angry and she exasperatingly put together an IUI plan to try to throw off my ovulation so that I could come in when I have time off in late Sept. She put me on birth control pills for a week and a half and I&#39;m supposed to do 5 days of Clomid 2x/day before going in for the IUI. She told me that this most likely wouldn&#39;t work and when I asked why I&#39;m paying them $1200 for &quot;barely a chance&quot; she couldn&#39;t give me a straight answer. In fact, she couldn&#39;t really tell me much of anything. I had questions for the nurses at this clinic and can never get one on the phone, they are always in meetings and call me back when I&#39;m unable to answer. They will only return your call 1x. The empathy shown during my initial consult was gone leaving me feeling like I had received a very rehearsed sales pitch. I was also in the office for a total of 5hrs which I found completely unacceptable.</p>

&#x200B;

Me and my wife (age 33 and 29) have been trying for 18 months with no luck and not a single sign of a positive test.  So far we have carried out all of the initial tests including a semen analysis for me and my wife has undergone the full range of blood tests, ultrasounds, and HSG tests which all come back normal (apart from a slightly low but within normal range AMH 16 pmol/l (2.24 ng)  for my wife's age)

&#x200B;

We have seen 3 specialists who are all saying that everything is good and they want us to keep trying for some time (another 4 months) before coming back.  They have also been leaning more towards me not having any issues and as if it would be my wife if there was an issue.

&#x200B;

After doing more research online I found that though my docs have told me 4% is completely fine, it can be what is making things hard as only 5-10% of men are below 5% and 15% is the average.  Some even say below 10% is poor fertility potential.

&#x200B;

My SA outline is after 4 days abstaining.

Diagnosis: Normozoospermia

Volume 4mililetres

75 milion per milletre

total 300 milion

45% progressive motility

4% morphology

&#x200B;

Should I perhaps be slightly worried that the morphology result is putting a handbrake on our journey?  Thanks in advance for any insight on the matter.

Wondering if anyone has heard of this company or has any reviews on Future Family?  It's supposed to be a company that offers either IVF loans, or a subscription plan where you pay a set amount monthly for x number of months that covers services you want/need for IVF (including meds). I found the article listed below saying that now, as part of the subscription plan, you can pick what services you want upfront and as you go along. 

&#x200B;

Plans also include ""concierge care"" with a personal nurse and coordinator, clinic matching, and services for diet and nutrition and even surrogacy.

I’m 38 and my AMH is 0.2 and I’m in my first egg harvest cycle. It looks like there might be 5 follicles with eggs in them. My insurance doesn’t cover PGS tests and it will cost $3900. If I paid for the testing and got one normal embryo, it would be a miracle. 

There’s also the thought that even normal embryos can fail about 40% , and sometimes mosaic embryos can be successful about 30% of the time. 

Suppose I go through all the PGS tests and get nothing normal. My clinic will not implant abnormal/mosaic embryos, but they will implant multiple untested ones. 

I’m thinking about skipping the tests and putting the money towards another egg harvest since this one will use up my benefit forever. I understand that without testing them and implanting them anyway I might be signing up for miscarriages and other issues, but it could also give a shot to an embryos that wouldn’t otherwise have a chance.

My husband and I decided to go through IVF over the summer after trying for two years. My mom has been planning to move across the country to be with me since I flew the nest in 2010, and it made sense to get the real stuff moving now that I'd have her support.

My MIL is a nice woman, but she has been a lost wonderer the last few years and seems to know less and less about what she wants: until now. This summer she decided she wanted to move to my state (currently she lives a few states away), and she is willing to make huge lifestyle changes to make it happen. 

A couple months ago she picked a town a few hours away, but once we committed to IVF all of a sudden it was too far, so she started to look closer. Yesterday we set our FET date, and she now decides that she want to move into my little city. I'm starting to get really overwhelmed... I haven't processed having my in-laws as neighbors, and I'm also trying to focus on this baby sitch and what this might mean for our family life.

I called the MIL because my husband is totally not sure what to do, and I get it: he loves his parents, wants to help, but also knows they are not good decision makers. He doesn't know how to handle  his mom, and often comments how he doesn't feel that close to her or knows how to communicate with her. I needed to tell her how I was feeling, which was confused and overwhelmed, and I wanted to talk a lot more about the implications of their decision to move here. If anything at all I wanted my in-laws to hear that I was scared of this change that is happening so suddenly, but I was willing to work with the idea if we can all commit to good communication.

As everyone here can guess, this doesn't go well. My MIL tried to tell me (in the nicest way possible) that I'm over reacting. I'm being controlling and they don't have any expectations for us, which I don't understand. Everything that I'm feeling was minimized because I'm a hormonal woman on meds, and eventually she says I am being selfish. To make things worse my husband got pissed and walked out of the house. He's never done that as long as I can remember. 

I just hope that someone out there believes me when I say that I want to try to make this work, and I want to keep the lines of communication open so this works out. Just because I have been going through infertility for a few years doesn't mean I've lost it and unjustified in my thoughts and feelings. 

I always feel sad when I read that community members of this sub feel alone - loneliness is my least favorite feeling. But yeah, today I feel alone too.

Last week I posted about my husbands decreasing sperm count.  I now have an update following my husband's urologist appointment and am looking for any further insight.

UPDATE:

My husband saw a urologist and brought his original sperm analysis as well as the sperm information from each of our IUIs. The urologist just from looking at the original sperm analysis asked why we were doing IUIs instead of IVF. He said that while his count was good, the motility and morphology were both low. He then looked at the IUI information and said the drop is count could have been due to his sickness or the vaccines, but his main concern is the low motility and morphology.He also did an ultrasound and found a left varicocele which he says can be affecting the motility and morphology. He wants him to have some additional tests done to see if any of this could be hormonal.

I am very frustrated because our clinic from the beginning said that all of his numbers were normal and they said that we were great candidates for IUI. However, the urologist says that based off of his original analysis he would have recommended IVF and does not see any advantage to IUI. I feel like our time and money have been wasted doing IUIs.

Does anyone have any experience with varicocele or low motility and morphology.

LAST WEEK's POST:

My husband and I began infertility testing in January. At that time we ran lots of tests on me and had a semen analysis done for my husband. Everything came back normal and they put us into the unexplained infertility category. We started trying medication like Clomid and still had no luck so we began seeing specialist. The specialist recommended IUI before trying IVF as all of our tests were in the normal range.

We had our first IUI in June and my husband's sperm was still in the normal range. He had something like 7 million post wash. We had our second IUI in July and his sperm count had dropped drastically to the 2 million range post wash. We just had our third IUI and his count has once again dropped rather drastically and is now at .9 million post wash.

We are making an appointment to meet with a urologist and hopefully get some answers. Has anyone had any experience with such drastic drops in such a short time?

A few things to note are that my husband was very sick at the end of June and had flu like symptoms with fever etc. for a few days. Also, my husband was never vaccinated as a child and our doctor recommended he get vaccinated since we are trying so he had MMR, tetnus, and HepB vaccinations in late June. Not sure if any of this could be cause of the drastically decreasing numbers.

In the past, we have had good egg collection/fertilisation/blastocyst rates. My AMH is on the low side of normal and his sperm results are good/great. 

However, something is going wrong with our embryos as none have stuck. Doctor firmly thinks it’s an embryo issue and we just need to find the ‘golden’ egg. We are both 30, and our only lifestyle risk factors are consumption of alcohol for my husband and coffee for me. 

I quit coffee after each transfer as I understand it can affect implantation, but I do drink 2 cups (plus a couple of cups of tea) at all other times, so it could be affecting egg quality I guess. 

My Husband is a very social person and loves to drink - it’s not unusual for him to have 2-3 beers after work and will often have 8+ drinks at social evens over the course of a day or evening. I am not a drinker, and frankly hate being around drunk people, so this would kind of annoy me anyway. But from what I understand, drinking can affect sperm in a big way. 

Ideally, I would like my husband to drastically reduce drinking now, so that if our next few transfers fail, and we have to go back to the drawing board and do another collection, the sperm will be in a better shape. This seems like a no-brainer to me given the amount of money we are spending on IVF - although to be fair, I haven’t quit caffeine.

My husband has no interest in doing this and refuses to commit to a specific limit on drinks - such as none during the week and <4 at events. He has tried to reduce drinking around the time of my egg collections/ when he has to give his sample - which is good for my sanity, but won’t help the sperm, which need 3 months to regenerate. One of the problems are that doctors have always told him his sperm results are good - and a I have been diagnosed with mild pcos and endometriosis. So, the implication is that if somethings going wrong, it’s my fault.

<p>Update in case anyone else is ever in this spot: My RE agreed that I may have jumped the gun on Day 1 and that the hormone levels hadn&#39;t dropped all the way yet. Today, which is probably ACTUALLY Day 3, my estrogen was 50.7, so I am cleared to start Lupron tonight and full stims tomorrow.</p>

230,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all -

Last week, I had a baseline ultrasound for a prep cycle/Igenomix ERA biopsy. The day of the u/s, the office called to say ""all good"" but the full report just popped up in my patient chart and it has some things I've never seen before in any of my other, many, *many* ultrasounds. Does any one know what this means?

Background: At the time of u/s, I had a retrieval about 1 month previously and had been on estrogen for about 3 weeks.

Uterus: ""Few cystic spaces in the fundal endometrium, largest measuring 2 x 2 x 2 mm with an echogenic ring around it."" Never seen that before!

Right adnexa: ""Simple: 2-4 small (5-10 mm) cysts. Two complex cysts filled with internal echoes (16 x 15 x 14 mm and 13 x 11 x 10 mm)."" 

Left adnexa: ""Simple: 2-4 small (5-10 mm) cysts. Complex cyst filled with internal echoes. (12 x 11 x 10 mm)""

In all other scans at this stage in my cycle (pre-FET to ""map the transfer""), they've measured, and shown, many more cysts but all small. E.g., both left and right would just say ""Number of antral follicles (2 - 10 mm): >10"".

&#x200B;

My big worries:

1) Does the uterine thing mean I have polyps?

2) Is that number of simple (small) cysts normal? In one of my last appts my RE mentioned my FSH spiking up, so now I'm terrified of DOR/POI.

3) Are the complex cysts in ovaries normal? Usually those pop up to confirm ovulation, but I was on loads of estrogen and bloodwork said I didn't ovulate.

I need your advice.

Long story short : off the pill since october 2015, decided to get help last year. 4th IUI was on the 14th of this month and was an awful cycle because they hesitated between follicle or cyst every two days and I had to take some gonal-F like crazy and had 3 ultrasounds in 5 days. But this IUI was successful. I was so happy and it took me a while to believe it. Because of my job, I had to tell all my collegues (work in a chemistry lab, had to be withdrawn right away).

I started bleeding this morning. Light spotting at first, mild cramping which got more intense, and then I passed a huge clot, and bleeding since. Not a lot (so I don't think it's ectopic pregnancy). Definitely think I'm having a MC. I'll get bloodwork and ultrasound tomorrow just to be sure, 'cause I've got to know if I need to stop progesterone or not.

I'm devastated. It's a sick trick to give me a BFP and take it away right after. I feel cheated. Everybody tells me how courageous I am to go through this, but I feel that my courage tank is empty.

How did you go on? What convinced you to keep going? Not that I believe it's a stupid thing to go on, I admire every person here 'cause it's a hell of a journey. I'm just not sure if I'm capable. I always thought I was a pretty rational person but since we're TTC, I think I've lost my mind. Emotions take over (as you can see by this post, obviously). How do I get through this and look forward?

We got 6 eggs and only 3 of them have fertilized. Seems like pretty awful odds that we&#39;ll even get anything usable from this cycle and it just seems like this is a slamming door on using my eggs. Has anyone else had a complication like this? Did you try another egg retrieval after something like this?</p>

I noticed last cycle that I'd get a slight (But annoying and icky) headache in the evenings up until after I ovulated. No idea why this is because I take my Clomid pill at 9am on the dot every morning. I don't get these headaches until about 9-10pm. I also seem to suffer strange panic attacks as I'm trying to fall asleep. They aren't full blown panic attacks but I'll become very agitated and restless whilst trying to nod off to sleep. This only lasted for about 5 cycle days (Clomid CD3-7) I don't know how long it'll last this time.



Shrugged it off and figured maybe this cycle would be different. I took my first Clomid pill yesterday at 9am as usual and at around 10pm the familiar headache came back. I headed off to bed around 1am and the same darned thing happened again with panic attacks! I was tossing and turning from 1am until 3am and it felt as though time was literally slipping from underneath me. It was the strangest sensation ever. I was also accusing my fiance of 'breathing too loudly' the entire night and I don't remember saying this at all but this Clomid seems to send me whacky at night time. I also apparently told him to get out of bed and sleep in one of the spare bedrooms because I couldn't stand his loud breathing! I was shocked that this was something I'd have said as I'd never normally speak like that to anyone haha.
It's now 11pm in the UK and my headache has arrived again tonight.

i've searched and read a bunch of older threads about tube issues, but i was wondering if any of you might want to indulge me a little further. an HSG this week revealed a dilated left tube--something i (a) had never REALLY considered and (b) didn't really know could happen. after talking to the doc who did the HSG (not my RE), she explained that it can sometimes happen if a woman has had surgeries in the abdomen that have created adhesions or significant scar tissue. i've had several bowel resections (yay Crohn's disease!), including repair of an enterovesicular fistula, so i guess it makes sense in a way. or rather--it's not the craziest thing i've ever heard, now that i understand that anatomy a little better.

EDIT: Thank you guys so much for all of your replies, I'm getting to returning them all now.  Good news (so far) regarding my sister: she didn't go into labor and is still holding strong.  The baby is surviving without any fluids and is showing a very strong heartbeat. She still has a huge battle ahead of her (like trying to make it at least 3 more weeks until she's in a much better playing field), but sadly the odds are still against her.  I'm staying for the duration of this week to be by her side, but have to fly back home this weekend as my cycle will start and I'll have to do another baseline to see where I stand with my transfer.

<p>EDIT: Thank you guys so much for all of your replies, I&#39;m getting to returning them all now.  Good news (so far) regarding my sister: she didn&#39;t go into labor and is still holding strong.  The baby is surviving without any fluids and is showing a very strong heartbeat. She still has a huge battle ahead of her (like trying to make it at least 3 more weeks until she&#39;s in a much better playing field), but sadly the odds are still against her.  I&#39;m staying for the duration of this week to be by her side, but have to fly back home this weekend as my cycle will start and I&#39;ll have to do another baseline to see where I stand with my transfer.  Thanks again for all of the kind words and great advice. </p>

I now want to get a second opinion with an RE who has experience treating people like me. Who should I be looking at?

My medicated cycles in a nutshell:

1. 300 iu Follistim - early recruitment, just one follicle.

2. Estradiol starting day 20 of prior cycle. Letrozole + 375 iu Follistim days 4-8, continue Follistim, then Cetrotide. Two follicles, only one large enough (18mm) at trigger.

3. Estradiol starting day 20 of prior cycle. Letrozole + 450 iu Follistim days 1-5, continue 450 Follistim, add Cetrotide days 10-13. Four follicles, only 2 big enough at trigger (22mm and 16mm).

My current clinic only wants to do IVF for a minimum of 3 follicles. Pretty sure my RE is in the high stim camp but may be willing to try other ideas. 

Do you think it's worth trying an IVF cycle with this clinic? Should I try high stim again or push for something different?

For reference, the original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/984yuj/use_of_embryo_glue_vs_hcg_wash/)

After reading the responses here and in r/infertilitybabies and continuing to do research on my own, I've decided to go with the hCG wash (500IU immediately before transfer). Ultimately, it came down to the following 

* Embryo Glue - I had a few people mention to me that their clinics no longer recommended or used embryo glue. I also found a few studies showing it made [no difference in pregnancy outcome](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264988065_Routine_use_of_EmbryoGlueR_as_embryo_transfer_medium_does_not_improve_the_ART_outcomes). Note there are also [studies showing it does improve outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691973/).  Neither of these studies are particularly large, but based on this, some clinics backing off on usage, and my own personal expeirence (implantation, but not success) I was not too keen on doing this option again.  My RE recommended this option.

* hCG Wash - Although hCG wash seems to be used less frequently, the usage seems to be increasing and I did not find any negative studies on usage or clinics that use it discouraging usage.  [Here's](https://www.cnyfertility.com/intra-uterine-hcg-at-embryo-transfer-jump-starting-the-implantation-process/) an example older article I found, but there are newer ones.  My RE was open to this option, but presented it as a gray area.  It is not part of their regular protocol.

* Both hCG wash and embryo glue - From the responses I got, some clinics do use both, but my RE recommended I do not, and I did not want to go against her advice.

Based on the above, I have decided to do an hCG wash prior to my FET. I know that none of these choices are going to magically make an embryo stick, but given I've tried embryo glue twice and the research and feedback on hCG wash, I've decided it's the best choice for me at this point.

My advice to others in this situation is to talk to their RE and to also do their own research (and figure out how much experimentation you are comfortable with).

My husband and I began infertility testing in January.  At that time we ran lots of tests on me and had a semen analysis done for my husband.  Everything came back normal and they put us into the unexplained infertility category.  We started trying medication like Clomid and still had no luck so we began seeing specialist.  The specialist recommended IUI before trying IVF as all of our tests were in the normal range.

We had our first IUI in June and my husband's sperm was still in the normal range.  He had something like 7 million post wash.  We had our second IUI in July and his sperm count had dropped drastically to the 2 million range post wash.  We just had our third IUI and his count has once again dropped rather drastically and is now at .9 million post wash.

We are making an appointment to meet with a urologist and hopefully get some answers.  Has anyone had any experience with such drastic drops in such a short time?

A few things to note are that my husband was very sick at the end of June and had flu like symptoms with fever etc. for a few days.  Also, my husband was never vaccinated as a child and our doctor recommended he get vaccinated since we are trying so he had MMR, tetnus, and HepB vaccinations in late June.  Not sure if any of this could be cause of the drastically decreasing numbers.

Thanks in advance for any insight.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: My husband saw a urologist and brought his original sperm analysis as well as the sperm information from each of our IUIs.  The urologist just from looking at the original sperm analysis asked why we were doing IUIs instead of IVF.  He said that while his count was good, the motility and morphology were both low.  He then looked at the IUI information and said the drop is count could have been due to his sickness or the vaccines, but his main concern is the low motility and morphology.   
 He also did an ultrasound and found a left varicocele which he says can be affecting the motility and morphology.  He wants him to have some additional tests done to see if any of this could be hormonal.  

I am very frustrated because our clinic from the beginning said that all of his numbers were normal and they said that we were great candidates for IUI.  However, the urologist says that based off of his original analysis he would have recommended IVF and does not see any advantage to IUI.  I feel like our time and money have been wasted doing IUIs.

I hope it is ok to post intros here. CP mentioned. I’ve been hanging out in still trying, but wondering if anyone here has a similar experience to me as I now find myself in an unexpected place.
 

Quickish run down of my history. I’m 33, husband is 34. TTC since March 2017. Husband is essentially fine except 1% morphology which has been pretty much dismissed as an issue due to very good counts. I had a Lap in March 2018 with Stage 3 endo but no blockages. Had a CP on the next cycle that lasted only two days. Started clomid + IUI (unmonitored) after that. On the second cycle with 100 mg clomid, developed vision changes (flashing in my peripheral vision), so no more clomid for me. Saw an RE for an initial consultation in July,  got a shit ton of labs like you do. Found out via patient portal that I have DOR (AMH 0.69, FSH of 10.2, AFC of 12). This was the absolute low point so far, because I had wait two weeks to talk to the doctor and had a very strong emotional reaction to the AMH number that felt like it came totally out of the blue. At the next RE visit in early August, I got talked down, he said don’t worry too much about the AMH, do 2-3 more IUIs with letrozole and then IVF. At that visit I found out I was a CF carrier, and so my husband was tested, we were given a 5% chance that he would also be a carrier. I took my letrozole to prep for the next iui.

 We got back from a very nice vacation this past Sunday, I had a positive OPK on Monday and scheduled the IUI with my OB office for the next day. I called the RE office to get the results of the CF carrier screen, thinking this was a formality, but found out at work that my husband is also a CF carrier. The doctor on the phone (who I have never met) advised me to cancel the IUI and that the next step will be IVF with PGD. Since we were probably going to have to do IVF anyway, I’m not like totally freaking out about this, but I kind of can’t believe that this is what is happening. 

I’m wondering if anyone else here is doing IVF due to a known genetic disease issue, +/- also being pretty damn infertile. I was already told that IVF will require higher dose meds due to my AMH, and that I can probably expect poor yields. And now we will not be able to use about 25% of the embryos. So I’m basically dreading this process. 

 
Thank you if you read all that.

* 2 euploid (considered ""normal"")
* 1 low level mosaic (used to considered ""normal"")
* 2 abnormal
* 1 complex abnormal

I mention ""normal"" because there is such a lack of research on transferring low level mosaic embryos, and before this level of mosaicism was able to be reported the low level mosaic was grouped in with euploid embryos. Ours has a partial deletion of the 5q. I am interested if anyone has transferred a low mosaic, and your results, or if you know of good research literature that can be shared. 

Some reading that supports abnormal FET:

Ideally we want 2 children, and are grateful for having 3 ""normal"" embryos to transfer, and we'd be happy with just 1 live birth. However given that FET success rates range between 40 - 60% for live births, we are concerned that if we run out some unforeseen reason we'll need to do another IVF when we're older and our egg quality is statistically expected to be worse.

We have left-over drugs that expire in 2 months, and a reduced round 2 rate, which is influencing our decision. Part of us wants to pursue the transfer and see what happens and hopefully begin our family, and the other more pragmatic part wants to attempt another round to hopefully increase our embryo inventory in case something devastating occurs with the eventual FETs.

Finished recent IVF that retrieved 16 eggs, 12 fertilized, 6 blasts, ~3 &quot;normal&quot; and our PGS results are:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 euploid (considered &quot;normal&quot;)</li>
<li>1 low level mosaic (used to considered &quot;normal&quot;)</li>
<li>2 abnormal</li>
<li>1 complex abnormal</li>
</ul>

<p>I mention &quot;normal&quot; because there is such a lack of research on transferring low level mosaic embryos, and before this level of mosaicism was able to be reported the low level mosaic was grouped in with euploid embryos. Ours has a partial deletion of the 5q. I am interested if anyone has transferred a low mosaic, and your results, or if you know of good research literature that can be shared. </p>

<p>Some reading that supports abnormal FET:</p>

</ol>

<p>Ideally we want 2 children, and are grateful for having 3 &quot;normal&quot; embryos to transfer, and we&#39;d be happy with just 1 live birth. However given that FET success rates range between 40 - 60% for live births, we are concerned that if we run out some unforeseen reason we&#39;ll need to do another IVF when we&#39;re older and our egg quality is statistically expected to be worse.</p>

<p>We have left-over drugs that expire in 2 months, and a reduced round 2 rate, which is influencing our decision. Part of us wants to pursue the transfer and see what happens and hopefully begin our family, and the other more pragmatic part wants to attempt another round to hopefully increase our embryo inventory in case something devastating occurs with the eventual FETs. </p>

<p>We&#39;re asking this community because the genetic counselors are not very helpful in saying low level is safe to transfer and we have no one else who may have experienced similar results and had to make a decision. Any input or stories would be so helpful for us.</p>

I'm 22 and was prescribed Clomid for infrequent ovulation (I do ovulate naturally but sometimes not once a month) I took 50mg CD3-7 this month.

I had trouble confirming ovulation this cycle. Clomid made me feel.. different. I had no ovulation cramps and I didn't get any nipple pain until about 4-5 DPO (Usually I get it on the day of O) My temps slowly rose too and I've still not established whether I ovulated on CD19 or CD20. Judging by EWCM I'm going to assume it was one of those two days.


My luteal phase is usually 12-13 days. I'm currently 11DPO and I've started spotting :-( my temp has also dropped. It's my understanding that the first day of your period is the one where the bleeding is full and fresh - not spotting, so I'm going to estimate my period will arrive tomorrow which takes me to 12DPO. That's only an 11 day luteal phase! My fiance pointed out that I may actually be 12DPO today (Keep in mind I struggled to confirm O this month so maybe O WAS CD19) 


Is this that big of a deal? My LP is commonly 13 days but recently has been 12. I'm worried because in the past I had two cycles where my LP was only 8-9 days. It was established these were just wonky cycles though as all my cycles since have been decent regarding LP.


Another thing about Clomid - did anyone else here notice it gave them very little symptoms regarding O? I heard online that Clomid caused crippling O pains in most women and I was bracing myself but I got none. It lead me to believe for days that I never actually ovulated. It was impossible for me to know for sure because I'm in the UK and low dose Clomid cycles are rarely monitored. 


I got a positive OPK on CD17 and it went negative to then turn positive again on CD18. Again, aiding to my confusion over where I actually O'd ughhh :-(

My clinic is saying that I have to wait until the next period after that, which for me would mean a month of birth control because I don’t get periods on my own. They said this policy is meant to give patients the highest chance of success by allowing the endometrium “time to recover from egg retrieval.” But so far they haven’t provided any studies or other evidence for this. My last clinic didn’t require a waiting month, so I’m trying to decide how hard to push for earlier transfer. 

I kinda suspect that the real reason is that they don’t want me to prep for transfer before PGS results come back, because that would mean canceling the FET prep if all are abnormal. My doctor let it slip that FET cycles are reported to the SART database at the start of the prep, so canceling for no PGS normals would count against the clinic’s statistics. But I’m trying to give them the benefit of doubt. Have any of you heard that success rates are higher with a waiting period between the egg retrieval and FET? 

All of this may end up being a moot point because so far it’s day 5 and none of our embryos are blasts yet. Two morulas were the farthest along, but my clinic doesn’t transfer or freeze that stage. Hoping for better news tomorrow morning. What I probably should be asking (and actually would like to know) is if your clinics will do back to back egg retrieval cycles without a waiting period in between. Or do they require waiting periods?

Infertility blows.
