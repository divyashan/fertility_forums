I have just had an IVF cycle that was converted to IUI due to my poor response to stims. I'm to take a OPT on December 11. When we thought we were doing IVF I assumed I'd have to skip the trip. When we learned I wasn't responding, looking forward to this trip helped me push through the disappointment.

But... the country is on the CDC watchlist for Zika.

Question: Do we go to the wedding? 

Pro: Few family making the trip, will mean a lot to have us there.
Con: Zika

Pro: But Zika seems to be [less of a thing now?](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/zika-has-all-disappeared-americas-why)
Con: But it could be really bad.

Pro: IUI is probably not going to work anyway, and I desperately need a vacation.
Con: Tests for exposure are unreliable due to confusion with dengue and Chickunguna. 

Pro: For women, it clears your system in 6 weeks, and that's when I'd start a new protocol anyway.
Con: For men, it's six months, which we just don't have.

Pro: But it's not even really a thing! We're more likely to be hit by a taxi!
Con: I've had an obscure impossible tropical disease before, and it sucked.

Your votes? Is my desire to run away to the beach blinding me to real risk, or is the risk overblown and getting in the way of my living a real life?

She reports, with great empathy, complex stories of couples who adopted domestically and from overseas, LGBT couples considering assisted reproduction and surrogacy, and women and men reflecting on childless or child-free lives.

This has been my second FET (today! woooooo!), but 4th time going through this rigamarole due to 2 ERA/ReceptivaDX biopsies. Here's how this went down this time. 

1) Baseline: everything's looking good post-2 months of Lupron Depot.

2) First real lining check: Looking fine. No reason to think we won't reach the required 8mm at next week's check.

3) ""Is it 8mm?"" check: No, it's like 7.3mm. Boo. They boost my butt with Estrogen and tell me to come back in 6 days to see if we're at 8.

4) The ""how about now?"" check: This is where the interesting part happens. 

I go to a decent sized clinic and it wouldn't be unusual for me to have a different ultrasound tech do each of my checks for a cycle.

I looked her right in the eye and asked if my favorite nurse is in today. She took it super well and said, ""Yeah, I better go get her."" 

Super awesome nurse measures me at 7.9, my clinic has a policy of rounding up, and she passed me.

An entire FET prep might have been fucked if I had not listened to my gut and gotten over the awkwardness of saying to another human with her tool in my vag that I basically don't trust her.

Hello,

I am a doctoral candidate in clinical health psychology and as part of my dissertation research I am gathering information on how individuals with chronic illness use the Internet as sources of support (gathering information, connecting with others, sharing experiences about their illness) and the effect it can have on life quality. The survey will take 5-15 minutes to take and consists mainly of multiple choice questions with a few optional written portions. The information collected is completely anonymous, no personal names or other identifiable information is asked for. Data will be stored on a protected electronic server and not accessible to anyone but myself and my dissertation chair and will be used solely for the purpose of completing my dissertation. 

I am posting to your subReddit as Reddit and other social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc) are the main target I would like to explore of how individuals use online support to help them manage the experience of chronic illness. I have been a user of online support groups through Reddit and Facebook for years to help me with Hashimoto's, PCOS, and infertility and have seen the benefits, hence my interest in exploring this from a research perspective. Chronic illness, as defined in this study, is the presence of a medical condition or illness that has been present for 6 months or more.  Pain may be a component of some chronic illness but it is not necessary to experience pain to be a part of this study.

I appreciate your time in taking the survey. Let me know if you have any questions. I am more than happy to answer them.

I'm seeing a second RE this afternoon. Here are some questions I thought of:

* With my history (2 CPs and TFMR in 1 year of TTC), is it crazy to jump into IVF? (*Maybe my RE at the IVF clinic is too quick to recommend IVF, so my second opinion is at a hospital.*) Am I missing some physiological downsides besides symptoms during the IVF process?

* Although IVF+PGS isn't a guarantee, will it have at least the same or slightly better chance of a LC *sooner* than trying naturally?

* Do you agree with my RE that whether to keep trying naturally or try IVF is 50-50?

* I only got SA, HSG, and some D3 testing done. Why do you think my RE didn't mention D21 testing? 

* How concerning are the moderately positive anti-phospholipid antibodies? My RE didn't seem too concerned because I was able to carry my TFMR.

* At 39 and 41 years of age, I recently started thinking about fertility preservation in addition to the short-sightedness of wanting my first LC. While waiting to schedule IVF, should I prevent pregnancy? How much *worse* would my eggs be a year from now if I wanted to bank embryos then?

* What do you think of my short (2-3 days) periods and slow-rising BBT?

Thoughts on these questions? Anything I haven't thought of?

We finally have high quality seed.  But the soil is still giving us trouble.  We seem to be struggling with a thin lining, especially during FET cycles.

We see a good bit of fluctuation during stim cycles anywhere from 7 to 10.  It may go 7 one day, then 9, then 8, then 9 again, and back down to 7.  It seems to peak usually a couple days before ER.

Unfortunately FET cycles never seem to get very thick.  They seem to top out in the 7-7.9 range, never quite cracking 8.  We attempted to help the thickness by supplementing with Vitamin D, E and L-arginine.  My wife is doing three estrace tabs vaginally, and e2 numbers were in the 800  to 1200 range.  

This month, after 11 days of estrogen, she measured 7.1, then on day 13, she measured 7.2 wich was when she was supposed to start progesterone.  Not content with those numbers, we started vaginal viagra supplements on day 13.  By day 15, my wife noticed extreme tightness and swelling, and her lining had reduced to 6.1.  We finished the last of five viagra suppositories last night.  This morning is day 18 of estrogen, and while the swelling and tightness has subsided, the lining has only rebounded to 6.5, far less than we were hoping for.  The original plan was to delay PIO by a week and take the 5 day course of viagra, so she will go back for another sono on Wednesday.  We doubt that she will have rebounded much if at all in that time.  By all accounts it looks like we'll be cancelling this FET, regrouping and trying again next month.

Any ideas on why the lining is not responding well to prolonged estrogen or viagra?  Doctors swear that there is no evidence of adhesions or asherman's after multiple saline sonos.  Unfortunately we have not had so much as a chemical pregnancy since the D&C after a MC at 11 weeks last year.  My concern is that it could be basal endometrium damage after an over zealous D&C, but the doctors do not believe this to be the case.

Is it common for some people to peak a little early as far as lining thickness?  Maybe we should be starting progesterone a little early, around day 9 rather than day 13 or 14.  On average my wife seems to be a little thicker around then.

Anyway, I'm just curious if anyone had any thoughts on a seemingly unresponsive uterine lining, what the causes may be, and what if any possible treatments we could try.

I do my best to be supportive of all my wife's moods, reactions, and feelings. 

But this last mindset has me confused and not knowing what to do.

About two years ago my wife starting to show a lack of sex drive. After a few months of doctor visits for infertility without an active sex life I asked her how she was handling the doctor visits and what she was feeling like doing next. I was able to get some information from her that threw me for a loop. 

She broke down and started to explain that not having sex meant she knew for sure what her period would bring. It was easy for her mentally to not continue to try and always know. 

Doing my best to understand and validate her feeling we agreed to take a break from it all and refocus on the positive aspects of our marriage. 


We did continue to try a few months later but have never visited a fertility docty or specialist since. 

Recently my wife has again started to loose her sex drive and is again wanting a break. 


I'm concerned that this pattern leads us to not trying and just accepting that we might never have children. 

Obviously I know better than that I point out the fallible logic of no sex = no pregnancy. Being supportive of my wife has always been my main priority for our relationship, but seeing my wife giving up is making it hard to be there for her.

I'm 30F and husband is 32M. TTC for well over a year with one chemical and three miscarriages all lost between 6-8 weeks. Husband has mild MFI

My most recent loss was today actually. This was the second pregnancy I've had a large subchorionic hematoma and third conceived via IUI. We had three heartbeats seen on the ultrasound last week, but this week there were none :(

During my D&C today my RE said I had adenomyosis. I must not have been well sedated because I piped up and said ""what the hell is adenomyosis?"" Cue nurse pushing a bit more midazolam or something into my IV. 

I asked several more times during my recovery and everyone was like, ""oh dear it's nothing to worry about"". Very helpful. 

After doing research all evening the prognosis doesn't seem too positive as there is little research regarding how adenomyosis affects fertility but there have been studies showing higher rates of miscarriage with women who have it. 

I'm going to speak to my RE tomorrow about it. The fact that she just diagnosed me on the spot is kind of worrisome (usually standard testing includes an MRI or biopsy) and didn't even follow up with me after leaving the OR left me with a sour taste in my mouth. 

Any other ladies here with adeno? My doc so far has been pushing us toward IVF because she strongly believes our losses are due to genetics. But, if I truly do have adeno would that even be the best course since the issue is mainly anatomical?

Earlier today I felt like I had a stroke of genius. I had an idea that there needs to be a full line of greeting cards you can buy and send to any woman (or man) dealing with infertility. Cards that say things like ""sorry you had to have a full hysterectomy"" ""sorry you're so sick from being overstimmed"" ""sorry for your journey/struggle/etc"". I was thinking about it being a broad line that could reach out to a lot of different categories like miscarriage, being sterile, needing surgeries, still trying, babyshowers fucking suck, hollidays are tough, plus vague thinking of you and your struggles type cards, etc etc etc. 

I think infertility is so difficult for even friends and family because a lot of times they simply don't fully grasp it, or they just don't know how to properly react or the right things to say. There is a legitimate need for greeting cards in this nasty arena of life. Imagine how simple and lovely it would be for the SIL to just pick a card and send it out to you to show she's thinking of you, even when she doesn't know exactly what to say to you.

Three were 'excellent' and three were 'fair to good' on day three. I was very hesitant to do a 5dt but my doctor said since I had so many good embryos we should do a 5dt. Well on day 5 all 6 of my embryos had died. So because of that, our doctor said it is likely a sperm issue because apparently the embryo takes its mitochondrial energy from the egg up to day 3, and then after that it takes its mitochondrial energy from the sperm. So our doctor had my husband do TESE in hopes for a better outcome on our 4th cycle. 

Yesterday they retrieved 13 eggs (I've gotten 13 eggs 3 times and 14 eggs once) and today they called to say only THREE fertilized. What the hell is going on. I'm so sick to my stomach. I know there are no guarantees but this is the least amount of eggs we have had fertilized on any of our cycles! Omg sometimes I want to scream and wonder what in the hell I am doing any of this for. I'm sick to my stomach and I know that the three we have right now could potentially work, but I just don't know why especially after doing TESE we would literally have WORSE fertilization rates than when we didn't do TESE.

This is something that I have dealt with before under extreme stress I just really hate that its come back now. 

But the thing that I am most worried about is that I feel like my personality is changing. I used to care about, well, everything and everyone. If someone needed help moving, I was there! If someone needed to talk, I was there! Someone needed advice, I was there! etc. I never did it because I felt obliged to.

I am trying really hard to remove myself from my feelings of resentment, anger, loneliness, sadness and frustration that is keeping me at arms lengths from my husband. I tell him how I’m feeling and that it’s not his fault, but his behaviour isn’t changing towards me. I don’t know what it is I need from him but I also know I don’t have the emotional capacity at the moment to talk him through the kind of things he needs to do/say to help me/us through. 

I’m usually the strong one. He is incredible and sensitive and thoughtful in a silent brooding kind of way; but we have established early on in our relationship that he usually needs a bit of a push to get things done. Anything at all - from applying to jobs to finishing that project at home that has been started x months ago, to calling his mum on her birthday. I’m ok with that usually. But I can’t bring myself to help him figure out what I need from him now. I keep thinking maybe if I knew how he was feeling about all this it might help, but he just says he feels bad for me. 

I have a very stressful job and I’m at the point where I am wondering whether I may need to take some time off to focus on my health - physical and mental. The thought of being without my salary - even for a while - makes me even more anxious as I’m the primary earner. This too has never bothered me before but now that I’m being prodded and tested, that I’m emotionally broken and exhausted, I feel like it’s all getting too much.

We tried (really hard!) for a year and then went looking for answers, just like Google suggests. My husband's numbers were basically half where they needed to be across the board - concentration, morphology, all that good stuff.

He was really devastated, but I was feeling good. We had an answer! We weren't doing anything wrong, it was just dumb bad luck. Another SA showed similar results. The numbers put us borderline for IUI and adequate for IVF. We decided it was worth trying IUI first and were excited to get started and feel like something was happening.

Then I had my HSG and they found endometrioma (endometriomi?) on both of my ovaries. Turns out I have endometriosis. I had an ovarian cystectomy to remove the cysts a couple weeks ago. It's been a rough few weeks. 

So now I'm waiting for my follow-up appt and then I'll check back in with the fertility clinic to see what's next. Depending on how things look post surgery, I think we still want to try at least one IUI to see how hub's sperm does with the sperm wash. But we're both bracing ourselves for 2018 to be the year of the IVF.

This year, PCOScrewThis and Mr. PCOScrewThis endured the worst year ever! We fought over things that tested the strength of our marriage, suffered a broken leg and two surgeries between us, watched the first grandchild be born to a younger sibling, saw a dozen of our friends welcome first and second babies with no effort or heartache, were made godparents to two children because we are pitiable enough to warrant that honor twice, got fed up with our crippling two-year infertility and decided to go through IVF, and as a special ending, endured our first loss after our first transfer ended in an ectopic pregnancy that PCOScrewThis got to deal with while Mr. PCOScrewThis was deployed halfway across the world. 

We’re so lucky to have everything else in our lives, because 2017 can KISS OUR ASS. We’re looking forward to year three of this infertility bullshit and all the new infertility “milestones” that are sure to come our way. 

Happy New Year!

I just started fertility treatment this cycle. I had a ""period"" induced by Provera, and then I took 10mg of Femara on CD 2 - 7.

The first two sources are referring to the same study. And it's a strange study. 

They followed LH levels in women for only SIX months and didn't adjust for any other hormones than alpha-amylase and cortisol. They state;

""No significant differences were observed in mean concentrations of cortisol (μg/dL) or alpha-amylase (U/mL) by study outcome.""

and

""FORs were elevated for cortisol suggesting a shorter TTP (FOR=2.51, 95% CI 0.75–8.42), but were reduced for alpha-amylase indicative of a longer TTP (FOR= 0.09, 95% CI 0.71–1.13).""

Both confidence intervals include 1,so the conclusions they draw from this are not valid. 

(FOR = the chance of getting pregnant, TTP = time to pregnancy) 

The only result in this study that is significant is the relation between alpha-amylase and the chance of conception day per day during only the FIRST menstrual cycle, but it was not significant when you look at all six cycles.

When I went in for my 10week exam (which happened to be the day we discovered the lack of heartbeat), my midwife commented that I had a retroverted uterus. At my first RE visit (within a day of ovulation), had a transvaginal ultrasound where she counted at least 10 follicles on one ovary. My other ovary was ""hiding"" behind my uterus so we couldn\'t see it. During my [HSG](https://imgur.com/xecD4mP) last month, it was ""confirmed"" that my uterus had some weird shape, either septate or arcuate. My RE had me go for an MRI to figure out which, since the path forward would be different depending on which it was. \n\nSo I just saw the MRI pictures posted to my health portal (no followup with my RE yet), and it looks like not only is my [uterus positioned normally (not retroverted)](https://imgur.com/Yf9Fnq1), but the doctor report (from the DR who reviewed the images, not my RE) says:\n>Uterus: Normal uterine configuration measuring 6.3 x 3.8 x 5.1 cm for a volume of 63.5 cc. No evidence of Mullerian duct anomaly. No myometrial lesion is seen.\n    The endometrial cavity is unremarkable with no evidence of a polyp. The junctional zone is unremarkable. 3 mm nabothian cyst.\n\n>Ovaries: Normal left ovary. Normal right ovary with a 2.2 cm follicle. No suspicious ovarian lesion.\n\n\nSo my uterus doesn\'t have a weird shape? What are we seeing in the HSG image then? \n\nDid my uterus change position on its own? Or did the midwife just feel it incorrectly? (She mentioned it after palpating my belly).\n\nWas the 10+ follicles a weird month, and now I just have the one?

When I went in for my 10week exam (which happened to be the day we discovered the lack of heartbeat), my midwife commented that I had a retroverted uterus. At my first RE visit (within a day of ovulation), had a transvaginal ultrasound where she counted at least 10 follicles on one ovary. My other ovary was &quot;hiding&quot; behind my uterus so we couldn&#39;t see it. During my <a href=""https://imgur.com/xecD4mP"">HSG</a> last month, it was &quot;confirmed&quot; that my uterus had some weird shape, either septate or arcuate. My RE had me go for an MRI to figure out which, since the path forward would be different depending on which it was. </p>\n\n<p>So I just saw the MRI pictures posted to my health portal (no followup with my RE yet), and it looks like not only is my <a href=""https://imgur.com/Yf9Fnq1"">uterus positioned normally (not retroverted)</a>, but the doctor report (from the DR who reviewed the images, not my RE) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uterus: Normal uterine configuration measuring 6.3 x 3.8 x 5.1 cm for a volume of 63.5 cc. No evidence of Mullerian duct anomaly. No myometrial lesion is seen.\n    The endometrial cavity is unremarkable with no evidence of a polyp. The junctional zone is unremarkable. 3 mm nabothian cyst.</p>\n\n<p>Ovaries: Normal left ovary. Normal right ovary with a 2.2 cm follicle. No suspicious ovarian lesion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my uterus doesn&#39;t have a weird shape? What are we seeing in the HSG image then? </p>\n\n<p>Did my uterus change position on its own? Or did the midwife just feel it incorrectly? (She mentioned it after palpating my belly).</p>\n\n<p>Was the 10+ follicles a weird month, and now I just have the one? I had to go back for &quot;one more&quot; MRI image this past Wednesday, CD17 (the original appointment was last Saturday, CD13), and since the report has a timestamp roughly half an hour after that last picture, I&#39;m not sure which day showed the 2.2cm follicle. <a href=""https://imgur.com/0itXxKh"">FF gave me crosshairs for Wednesday</a>, but I won&#39;t be surprised if it jumps to CD19 in a couple days.

<p>Before jumping into IVF, should I see a RE at my hospital for a second opinion, since s/he would be more impartial?</p>

My SO and I were married earlier this year and have recently celebrated 5 years together. We’ve been talking about starting a family since our second date. As we were both young and had invested everything we had into a renovation project, when I thought it was time to start trying (2 and a half years in) he decided he wasn’t ready. It was a really difficult time for me, as not having children was a definite deal breaker for me. I knew he would come around eventually and that he just needed to ‘grow up’ a little,  but I had been waiting basically since I turned 15. I was ready to walk away, but I knew he was a man like I’ve never met before. He didn’t understand that i had been waiting all my life. I waited to finish school, to go to uni, to get a job and a house and all those things that would make my life a settled place to bring a baby into this world. A baby was always the end goal. All my life. He, on the other hand was just enjoying the start of our life together. 

He was worth the wait of course, and now here we are. I know it’s not reasonable or fair to put so much on him, but since we’ve been struggling to conceive, I feel like I’m closing up more and more into myself. I hardly want to talk to him about it. It's like I am really struggling being around him, like I don't have the emotional capacity to filter and he annoys me and then I get cranky and he gets clingy and weak when I pull away. My mum, with whom I am the closest usually, is a bit the same. She picks now of all times to side with him on everything. She tells me off for being short with him - like it's any of her business. 

I know that no matter how sympathetic he tries to be, he just doesn’t get it. He says things like ‘I’m sure it’ll be ok and it’ll happen when we’re not even expecting it’ or ‘I know this is all you dream about but we have so much in our lives to be happy about’. I want to scream when I hear these things. This is not a dream for me. It’s my life purpose. I know I am difficult and aren’t communicating anymore and that it probably makes me a bad wife. But it feels like I’m grieving and I can’t seem to stop. 

It was only last month that we got confirmation that we’ll need ‘assistance’. I did blood tests ovulation tracking for the first time and discovered that I hadn’t yet ovulated at day 18 of my cycle. “So should I do this again next month?” I asked my GP. 

“No. Let’s just wait to see what the specialist says”.

The specialist of course, isn’t available until mid January. I cried on the phone to the poor receptionist who couldn’t understand that, while two months isn’t a big deal in the scheme of things, I had made a deal, bargained with the fertility gods in my mind to be able to announce my pregnancy to my family on Xmas day. Another dream gone up in smoke. Another moment that becomes a new memory I can think of 100 times a day and that makes my heart ache and the back of my throat close up. I have practice breathing so I don’t start panicking and hyperventilating.

And yet, damn it, there’s still hope. That little voice inside of me that is telling maybe it’ll just happen anyway. It’s like I’m biologically programmed to set myself up for heartache.

My S/O and I have been dating for 5 years now. Strictly monogamous/faithful. The biggest thing is that we have been having unprotected sex since day one of our relationship. Collectively I've been on the birth control for a year of our entire relationship. Previously I've been on BC since I was 13/14, am 23 now. I have been off of BC for 4 years and we have always had unprotected 'not pulling out at all' sex. I realized that with a combination of uterine problems and not getting pregnant I may have an issue with infertility. With that preface here is my big hang up. 

When I first met my boyfriend he was the drummer of a local metal band. With being in the metal band, you tend to hang around the other girlfriends in the group during shows and you create a tight little bond with them. This one girl in particular I'll call her Shelly for privacy purposes. Shelly was the typical 'smoking hot metal chick' but she had a more modern taste in fashion (not like hot topic threw up on her). We became friends immediately, I idolized Shelly, I wanted to be like her in every aspect. I wanted her confidence, her bubbly outgoing personality, her sense in fashion, and I envied how pretty she was.  I was able to connect really well with Shelly even through text, she was just very welcoming and friendly and we've been friends for 5 years. Then a conversation between my S/O and I changed it all. 

My S/O had told me in the past that he had a 'mistake' with a girl long before he met me. (so we were not dating, I didn't even know he existed) Years go by maybe three since that comment was made about the unknown chick and the mistake, and somehow it gets brought back up. Out of curiosity I ask him what kind of mistake did you have, and he had said that he had gotten a girl pregnant but wouldn't say who. I told him that it would hurt me more if I didn't know who the girl was, and he had told me that he had gotten Shelly pregnant. Mind you I knew at this time that I've been having some variation of infertility and this news shattered my world. The girl I so longed to be like had something over me that I could never have with the man I loved. He never hid this from me, I just never cared to ask. I haven't uttered a word about it to anyone (except Reddit) but it hurts so bad. It's been close to two years since he told me the news, but I can't cope. We talk about it a lot, she decided at the time not to keep it, but she at one point wanted to be serious with him. (before him and I met) he assured me that she wasn't his type it was more of a fling that got messy with the pregnancy but it hurts like knives. I still love her as a friend, but seeing her face and hearing her name twists my guts and I can't speak to her about it. Is almost two years too long to grieve about this? Am I childish for thinking these things? I need help because it upsets me to my core, it makes me think I'm that much more broken and unworthy. I feel so robbed.

I haven&#39;t uttered a word about it to anyone (except Reddit) but it hurts so bad. It&#39;s been close to two years since he told me the news, but I can&#39;t cope. We talk about it a lot, she decided at the time not to keep it, but she at one point wanted to be serious with him. (before him and I met) he assured me that she wasn&#39;t his type it was more of a fling that got messy with the pregnancy but it hurts like knives. I still love her as a friend, but seeing her face and hearing her name twists my guts and I can&#39;t speak to her about it. Is almost two years too long to grieve about this? Am I childish for thinking these things? I need help because it upsets me to my core, it makes me think I&#39;m that much more broken and unworthy. I feel so robbed. (S/O is not in the doghouse, he did nothing wrong this was long before we even knew each other) </p>

<p>TLDR; S/O got another woman pregnant before we met. I&#39;m struggling with infertility, found out not too long ago, need help coping.</p>

Backstory:
We have been actively trying for 18 months. Not counting the years before that where we never tried not to. 3 weeks ago I finally got my turn at the fertility clinic. My husband has had his turn, and will be returning for varicocele correction surgery in December. 

My visit:
I got a seemingly minuscule evaluation, some basic blood work, a brief review of my HSG and verbal review of some BARE history. (My regular clinic had apparently not sent my history over even though they said they had ).  Had a 3 minute transvaginal ultrasound where she said I must have just ovulated (maybe the day before) and that everything looked fabulous. She told my husband his wife had beautiful ovaries.... then we went back to her office and she diagnosed us with unexplained female infertility. She gave us a 1-2% chance of ever conceiving naturally. 
She suggested no further diagnostic testing, and ran us through IUI procedure descriptions. She does not suggest drugs on their own and says most people don’t go straight to IVF. She has also told us that IUI success rates are about 8-10% successful per round, and most couples do 3-4 rounds at a time. Of them, 1 in 3 will be successful. The financial bid they sent us after the appointment  broke it down to be roughly $1200.00 per month of IUI, all of which is out of pocket for people like us that have Tricare. So this means she suggests roughly $4800 worth of treatment, that has a 33% chance of success. We went home after, cried... talked... eventually decided to go straight to IVF whenever we can afford to proceed. Asked for a quote, they said roughly $13k per round, with other options like multi round discounts and money back options and the like. The thing is, we don’t even have the $4800,  let alone $13k-$20k. Nor can we qualify for a loan at roughly a 16-24% interest rate, and then whatever associated costs should it actually succeed. I really wish tricare covered...  anything. 

On a separate note, I somehow feel more swindled as a potential walking dollar sign, than I feel like I’ve been seen by a medical professional. I feel like it’s just a money scheme, or else why would she have been so forceful about IUI first, especially with her own low estimates of success?? 

Even worse, there are no less than 3 people in my place of employment that found out in the last week that they and their wives have... you know. 2 of which are on my shift, and in my personal space every. Day. So I spent literally all night in an aircraft maintenance squadron break room crying into my lean cuisine for having awful petty miserable feelings towards my generally liked coworkers. I have no idea how to feel or what to change or where to go with those emotions. 

My husband wants to PCS. This means move. He wants to go overseas (we’re both active duty military). Cool, except that THAT means taking any money we had been planning on using (to pay off some of our debt so that maybe in a couple years we can qualify for a medical loan) to potentially have to pay to move our dogs overseas with us, should we get orders. We also live paycheck to paycheck, thanks in no small part to the liver we pay out to his ex, to the tune of 16k per year. Taking the dogs isn’t an option, they’re a responsibility we took on for life and they’re the only babies I have. You’d have to pry them out of my cold, dead hands. 

I feel so lost. And after today, so shocked that news that we totally anticipated (infertility diagnosis) can be so unimaginably painful. I have no idea where to go from here or who to turn to. 

The feeling of having just had my 30th birthday, and feeling everything I ever wanted just slipping away, is crushing. My husband leaves in 3 hours for a TDY and will miss my entire fertile window this cycle, not like it matters anyway since boning will apparently never work. I’m going to finish my glass of alcoholic eggnog, go cry some more in my shower, and crawl in bed between my dog and my husband and toss and turn all night again and probably wake up exhausted, and definitely alone. I cried in front of one of my subordinates when I gave him a ride home. He could tell something was wrong. I dropped him off to his wife and etc and cried the rest of the way home. 

How do I feel happy for other people? How do I get rid of the ugly thoughts? How can I get past every commercial or every super pregnant cashier at every place I go to? What do I do about the Facebook posts that plague me and the nightmares that keep me up every night? 

I’m so tired and so confused and I feel so alone. 

I had tried to stay off reddit as a whole while I waited for my appointment at the fertility clinic and now I’m back, and I’m sorry for the huge post and I’m sorry I tried not to trigger anyone and I’m sorry I don’t know what else.

Cool, except that THAT means taking any money we had been planning on using (to pay off some of our debt so that maybe in a couple years we can qualify for a medical loan) to potentially have to pay to move our dogs overseas with us, should we get orders. We also live paycheck to paycheck, thanks in no small part to the liver we pay out to his ex, to the tune of 16k per year. Taking the dogs isn’t an option, they’re a responsibility we took on for life and they’re the only babies I have. You’d have to pry them out of my cold, dead hands. </p>

<p>I feel so lost. And after today, so shocked that news that we totally anticipated (infertility diagnosis) can be so unimaginably painful. I have no idea where to go from here or who to turn to. </p>

<p>The feeling of having just had my 30th birthday, and feeling everything I ever wanted just slipping away, is crushing. My husband leaves in 3 hours for a TDY and will miss my entire fertile window this cycle, not like it matters anyway since boning will apparently never work. I’m going to finish my glass of alcoholic eggnog, go cry some more in my shower, and crawl in bed between my dog and my husband and toss and turn all night again and probably wake up exhausted, and definitely alone. I cried in front of one of my subordinates when I gave him a ride home. He could tell something was wrong. I dropped him off to his wife and etc and cried the rest of the way home. </p>

<p>How do I feel happy for other people? How do I get rid of the ugly thoughts? How can I get past every commercial or every super pregnant cashier at every place I go to? What do I do about the Facebook posts that plague me and the nightmares that keep me up every night? </p>

<p>I’m so tired and so confused and I feel so alone. </p>

<p>I had tried to stay off reddit as a whole while I waited for my appointment at the fertility clinic and now I’m back, and I’m sorry for the huge post and I’m sorry I tried not to trigger anyone and I’m sorry I don’t know what else. </p>

I was part of your community for a long time and still recognize a lot of you. I think about you guys all the time. 


I wanted to reach out to you guys about a very dear friend of mine. She is writing a book about women who never had children for whatever reason and while I realize that's not the goal of anyone here, I remember quite well going to that place of ""what if I never have children"" and I know it would have been...comforting perhaps to read about women who lived that reality. 

She struggled deeply with infertility and never had children herself. She been writing this book for many years and she is now working with a publisher!!! However, her team of editors **needs to know is that there's sufficient interest in the non-mom experience to make publishing a book worthwhile.**

If you'd like to help see this book become a reality, please just take a minute and explore [her website - click here](https://www.katekaufmann.com/the-book) and share with your friends. The editors are monitoring the number of hits on her website and how often blog posts are read.

Here's a short summary of the book:

*Imagine having your own team of honest childless aunties, wise childfree godmothers, and savvy experts describe life's options and challenges when you don't have kids. Never Expecting: Life Outside the Mainstream of Motherhood weaves together perspectives of non-moms aged thirty-seven to ninety-one, a growing body of research, and the author's own story into a practical guide to what life without kids can entail.*

157,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey buddies,

It has been a while since I've been active around these parts. My heart has been healing after a miscarriage this summer and there are so many new people here that it left me feeling overwhelmed and sad whenever I tried to dip my toes back in. 

But now it looks like we're planning for our next and likely last transfer. We had a retrieval in April and ended up with 4 blasts, although I only found out in June that 3 were day-5 blasts and 1 is a morula. So we transferred the best looking one immediately after retrieval, negative. Then we transferred the second best looking one in June, ended up being a two-month shit show – low, slow-rising betas, multiple ultrasounds, no one wanting to officially declare that it wasn't viable even though they all said it unofficially, terribly painful miscarriage, all while we were moving and living with our parents. Now that I'm (mostly) on the other side, I can officially say that it was one of the worst things I've ever been through.  

So, our current dilemma. We have 1 day-5 embryo and 1 morula left. Our embryos are in Turkey and we're living in Italy now. We'll probably transfer both in one go next summer. I asked my RE about whether it would be prudent to get any tests done before this last transfer (hysteroscopy, Receptiva, ERA) and he said he would recommend a hysteroscopy. The only thing is that it's priced at $2,000-$3,000, which is a serious chunk of change for us – it's definitely more than the FET and coming close to what we paid for a retrieval and fresh transfer (all included). Since the last embryo, despite almost surely being abnormal, implanted, I'm leaning towards skipping the hysteroscopy and just going for the FET. Any thoughts? I'm curious what my fellow barren bitches would do. We could probably afford it if we went into debt, but we both work in jobs that aren't incredibly lucrative and it would definitely be a hardship for us (if we were lucky enough to get pregnant, this would be a pretty big financial burden to take).

Recently, I made a post asking for in-put concerning my common-law husband's low sperm count. 

Yesterday, I spoke with the fertility Doctor. I got the answers I needed. 

See, it turns out, my husband's sperm count is far too low for us to conceive naturally. (At only 2 million!) 

The specialist straight out told us that the BEST bet for us is government funded IVF treatment. Originally, because of how invasive it is, and how much I despise needles, I was hoping to get IUI. He said that the chances, even with IUI, are slim. 

When he recited this, I recalled a post urging me to go straight to IVF. And I told him I want to sign up for the program.

I'm very scared. I don't think I can inject myself but my husband is confident that he'll be able to take care of it for me. 

I have a lot of blood tests to do (well, both of us), and we see a nurse next week to be placed on the IVF waiting list. (He said 8 months...)

The only thing is, the Doctor also said my blood tests results indicate that I DID NOT ovulate that month! When I pushed him as to why, he did not seem interested. He just said; ""You're probably not ovulating."" It seems that he's not interested in the cause of me not ovulating because he'll just induce it. He said we have an option of IUI in-between the wait. 

I'm trying to research all of the steps and get me used to it. 

I'm hoping I have made the right decision moving forward, even though my anxiety is pretty high pertaining to it.

I was reminded of that fact when one of the moms complained about how she keeps getting pregnant after having multiples, getting her tubes tied, using contraception, etc. Okay, not a big deal, that's understandably a problem. Then another mom replied, ""People don't understand what a huge trial being overly fertile can be. At least if you're infertile you can distract yourself and forget about it from time to time by travelling​, going to the movies. You can't forget your kids.""  

That brought all the pain back like being hit by a truck. I wanted to scream in her face about how insensitive that was. I wanted to tell her that's like comparing the wealthy to the poor and saying poor people don't understand because they don't have to worry about choosing what to eat for dinner. (Yes, a bit dramatic, but it's what went through my mind)  

I decided to try a more rational approach, and just said that as someone who is infertile you never forget that fact any longer than it would take to hire a babysitter and go out for the night. I asked her not to compare the situations because they are very different struggles, and left it at that.  

I'm sure she wasn't expecting to see someone infertile in a mommy group, but come on. You have to know that that's a horribly insensitive thing to say. I would happily have had six kids like this woman had if I had been able to get pregnant. It was always my dream to have a big family...and here she is complaining about having exactly what I want.  

Anyway. How would you have responded to this woman? I knew you all would understand exactly how I feel. Thanks for letting me vent.



Edit: So let me ask your opinion because now I'm pissed... My final reply to her after she took it to social media was this:

Look, I sympathize with your situation completely. I can't imagine worrying about getting pregnant to that degree and I'm sorry that's something you have to go through. Again, one is not worse than the other, but there are foolproof solutions to being overly fertile. 
  
Forgive me, but your comment did not say ""in my situation."" It said, ""At least if you're infertile YOU can distract yourself."" That's a generalization about infertile people, and it's false in a large majority of situations. 'At least' is also a term of comparison. Then you said ""YOU can escape the heartache."" I'm pointing out that no, I and many others can not escape. I'm also suggesting that maybe making generalizations about a different group of people isn't the best way to bring awareness to a very different issue. I would not have felt the need to say anything if you had said something along the lines of, ""At least when I struggled to get pregnant I could distract myself."" I felt like I could not keep scrolling without saying something, because it did seem to be an insensitive comment about a very serious issue. 
  
I've never met someone who is truly infertile, who knew they would never carry a child, who would agree that they can forget their pain. I know I never could. Everything is a reminder.  

Anyway. I feel I've said everything I need to say. The grass is not always greener.   
  
  
She just came back with, ""the only foolproof solution is a hysterectomy.""

I'm not sure if this is the right forum or not, but we're at the end of our rope really. Feel free to delete if this is the wrong forum.

So... long story short. My wife and I have never had issues *getting* pregnant, but every single one has ended in miscarriage. In the last two years, we have had seven pregnancies. They've ended at 9 weeks, 5 weeks, 5 weeks, 5 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks respectively. Her body always holds on to the babies after they've died. That is to say, the miscarriages are 'fetal demises'. In the last pregnancy, the baby's heartbeat was there one day (180bpm), and gone the next. Had I not had a nightmare that the baby had died and asked for a reassurance scan, we likely would have made it to our 18 weeks appointment.

The only thing we've found out is that she has a paracentric inversion on chromosome 13. No one can tell us what this means for us from a miscarriage perspective. According to which geneticist you speak with, this should cause *no* issues, no *detectable* issues (i.e., implantation failure), a 40% miscarriage rate, or no issues past the first trimester. Needless to say, we've seen everything *except* what the geneticists tell us.

Our last loss was well into the second trimester, and the baby was morphologically normal on ultrasound (they couldn't do much when the baby was out, because she had to do a D&E). The baby measured on time the day he/she died, so it doesn't seem like there was any growth problem. The radiologist told us the placenta was still attached. We're still awaiting karyotype results, but I have a feeling it's going to come back normal.

She's being treated for subclinical hypothyroidism. Her doctor suspected PCOS at one point, but quickly scrapped that once she saw how often she ovulated and we conceived on our own and her normal ovaries. She was treated for moderate hyperprolactinemia following our very first miscarriage at 9 weeks (She's apparently really good at lactating, and had her milk come in pretty fully after our last loss at 16 weeks).

I feel like we really need to get an answer here. We want to have a baby, and don't really mind the early losses, but this last pregnancy turned a night of fun into a hospital visit and major surgery.

The doctor has tested her for hormonal issues. We couldn't find anything. She ovulates spontaneously, and the babies implant without any help. It seems like the problem is with carrying them to term.

The doctor has tested her for auto-immune disease. They can't find a single auto-antibody or indicator of inflammation. The tests don't even report a result for her, because they're below the lowest threshold detectable. She's even been tested for some of the more exotic antibodies... still nothing.

The doctor has tested her for inherited thrombophilias... nothing.

The only test that has come back as abnormal is a high antithrombin iii level, but according to several doctors and the lab, this is not associated with any disease (WTF?).

We're being referred to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist next, and hopefully they will find something. The doctor was talking about putting my wife on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox or clexane, depending on where you live) as a prophylactic measure, although they cannot identify any thrombophilia.

We're really worried about this late loss. Like I said, the early losses are manageable, but these later ones are scary. Moreover, from what we understand, your risk of losing a baby is pretty much flat after a heartbeat's been identified in the second trimester, which makes us worried that we are now at increased risk of stillbirth.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to things we can do to help our babies survive? Has anyone had success with lovenox and recurrent miscarriage for unknown causes? Does anyone know of other conditions that could cause loss in the second trimester with a (seemingly) normal baby? We started trying at 23, and I'm worried we're just going to have 20 years of dead babies until we reach menopause.

<p>The only test that has come back as abnormal is a high antithrombin iii level, but according to several doctors and the lab, this is not associated with any disease (WTF?).</p>

<p>We&#39;re being referred to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist next, and hopefully they will find something. The doctor was talking about putting my wife on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox or clexane, depending on where you live) as a prophylactic measure, although they cannot identify any thrombophilia.</p>

<p>We&#39;re really worried about this late loss. Like I said, the early losses are manageable, but these later ones are scary. Moreover, from what we understand, your risk of losing a baby is pretty much flat after a heartbeat&#39;s been identified in the second trimester, which makes us worried that we are now at increased risk of stillbirth.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to things we can do to help our babies survive? Has anyone had success with lovenox and recurrent miscarriage for unknown causes? Does anyone know of other conditions that could cause loss in the second trimester with a (seemingly) normal baby? We started trying at 23, and I&#39;m worried we&#39;re just going to have 20 years of dead babies until we reach menopause. We&#39;re going to reach the double-digits soon as is</p>

Other infertility communities irritate the crap out of me because of the cutesy jargon and ridiculous bloggers who have professional photographers take pictures of them crying and embracing after a negative home pregnancy test.

We (my husband and I) found out yesterday our first FET was unsuccessful with a negative beta hcg.  We're pretty devastated.  I just wanted to introduce myself before I start commenting on threads. I'm still learning the ins and outs of Reddit and appreciate etiquette reminders. 


A little history
February 2015: Natural conception. Resulting in missed miscarriage (April 2017) at 10 weeks with fetus measuring 7w6d.  
October 2015: Ovulatory function had not returned. Official PCOS diagnosis. 
October 2015-January 2017: Metformin, Clomid and eventually letrozole, all unsuccessful
April 2017: Failed IVF/ICSI. 3 eggs retrieved, 2 mature, 1 fertilized: arrested on day 5. 
July 2017: IVF/ICSI/CCS #2. 14 retrieved, 11 mature, 9 fertilized. 3 day 5 blasts, 3 day 6 blasts.  2 CCS normal. 
November 2017 FET #1: difficult transfer requiring firm catheter, Failed. 

I'm also a NICU nurse and struggling to keep interest and satisfaction in my job I've been passionate about for years. (Any tips?)

Anyway, sorry for the long winded post. I look forward to interacting with everyone.

I listed off all the supplements I was taking and my RE said, *if you really want to take anything, I would recommend probiotics.* I asked her why and she said there was really interesting emerging science on the benefits of certain bacterial flora in the uterus and vagina, in relation to pregnancy outcomes.

**Hold the bus.** In my year plus of being on this site, I don't recall probiotics ever being discussed. Therefore, research time.

Here is what I came up with:

* [Relationship of Vaginal Bacteria and Inflammation With Conception and Early Pregnancy Loss Following In-Vitro Fertilization](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/idog/2003/545298/abs/) - small study from 2002 showing a positive relationship between lactobacillus and pregnancy rates/live births.

* [Examination of bacterial contamination at the time of embryo transfer, and its impact on the IVF/pregnancy outcome](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-007-9146-5) - study from 2007 showing decreased pregnancy rates in women who test positive for certain bacteria.

* [Microorganisms within Human Follicular Fluid: Effects on IVF](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059062) - study from 2013. Tons of info but my take away was Lactobacilli was associated with positive pregnancy rates.

* [Does intravaginal probiotic supplementation increase the pregnancy rate in IVF–embryo transfer cycles?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648310613016) - study from 2005. Long story short, the findings are that no, supplementation vaginally with a probiotic after retrieval does not increase positive pregnancy outcomes. This study doesn't look at supplementation prior to retrieval.

So? Thoughts? Has your RE ever mentioned this? I am going to ask my RE if the probiotic she suggested is supposed to be taken vaginally or orally.

 *Sub Rules and links to info and results threads below*

Welcome to r/infertility. **Please read our rules and our sidebar to familiarize yourself with the customs and guidelines of our subreddit before posting and participating here.**  
Please refer to the bottom of this post for the links to the Monthly Waiting and Weekly Results threads.

**SUB RULES**

Our sub has strict rules for participation. We ask that all members familiarize themselves with them in full, but here are the key points:

1. **Pregnancy test (beta) results should ONLY be mentioned in the weekly results thread or the sticky post-beta discussion thread.**

2. Discussions of beta-hell / limbo, uncertain results or early infertility pregnancy issues/fears should ONLY be discussed in the post-beta thread (stickied under this thread each week).

3. Mention of pregnancy or live children is touchy here. It can be mentioned in vague and neutral terms (such as we had success after x,y,z protocol). Unprompted discussion or explicit mention of pregnancy will be removed. Note that mentions of pregnancy loss are exempt from this rule and are allowed in the main sub area.

4. Infertility is not cute, therefore cutesy acronyms (BD, AF, DH, Embies, follies, etc) are banned. The full list of banned terms can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2c0fpq/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms/).

5. Infertility is stressful and it is easier to step on people’s toes than you might think. Please consider the emotional state of others during discussion here. Venting, jealousy and bitterness is to be expected.
 
6. No linking our posts outside of the infertility family.

7. If you see a post that breaks any of our rules or is troublesome to you please **use the report button**. The mods are happy to assess and remove or address reported posts. Let's all help keep this a safe, supportive community.

**Helpful Links**

Members of this sub can be here for a long time and certain posts can get repetitive. Please use the search function before posting questions that may be more common. A few helpful mega-threads and FAQ threads can be found at the links below:

**Other helpful reddit communities you may wish to consider:**

For those who have been trying for a while or starting with infertility testing / treatment r/stilltrying has been a helpful transition sub for many before joining here.
For those who need support TTC after loss, r/TTCafterloss can provide unique support for this.

For those who have become pregnant after ART/IF treatment, or who have questions for people who have had success, r/infertilitybabies is for you.
For those transitioning to child free life after infertility r/IFchildfree is a safe space for this.

For those with children who are experiencing infertility trying for more, r/secondaryinfertility may be helpful and is a safe space to mention existing children while you explore your IF.

There is a sub just for male infertility as well if any of our male members would like to connect with others in their shoes. /r/maleinfertility

These people obviously struggled with infertility to end up needing those treatments. Don’t they remember what it was like?

Can Parents really not mention their kid without adding some adjective? I tried to think of other things in my life and I definitely just say my husband or my dog not my sexy as fck husband or my cuddle puddle of a dog. 

So I ranted about this to my husband and he gave me that look like I had lost my mind but then that look that he knew it was just best to agree with me, so he did. But I don’t think he totally got it.

...And the vent/story:

My first appointment with my RE was mid October after waiting 2 months for it, in NH. Had the standard barrage of testing done. HSG showed a possible septum, so they booked a 3D ultrasound appointment. I called to book a follow up, and 2 weeks was the earliest time available (which put it a month after the 1st appointment, and into my next cycle).

Friday, before the appointment we had a house inspection and didn't accounted for heavy, heavy traffic getting to the Dr's, since we didn't really know the route. I called 40 minutes before my appointment to say I was running late and was told that the doctor would know I was coming. I was half an hour late and arrived to a locked door. The was no one associated with my clinic there. Called them, and got transferred pointlessly for while, and eventually told I'd need to reschedule... at which point I melted down, and my mood has been a mess since and I really wanted to just break that stupid door.

My fertile period (probably) started yesterday. They never posted my HSG or my 3D sonogram results to my portal, so I don't know if I need surgery and should be using protection in the meantime (not that we're likely to suddenly be fertile, but maybe a month of levothyroxine has shifted the odds). The secretary called today, and was really callous about the whole thing. I asked to have the doctor call back with the results of the sonogram, and she's taking her time with that.

I hate not knowing what's going on. I hate feeling like time is slipping away with nothing happening. I hate that stupid locked door. I hate that the missed appointment sapped all of the joy out of buying a house, and left all of the stress. I hate that my realtor keeps reminding us that we don't have to fix lead paint since we don't have a child under 6. I hate putting so much energy and emotion into something that remains outside my control.

I'm contemplating switching doctors (within the same clinic), especially since we'll be moving in December, but I'd rather travel an hour to appointments than possibly waste another 2 cycles waiting for a first visit with someone new.

222,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I'm currently living in northern Europe and in a moment of irritation with my job many months ago, I applied to a position that popped up in my daily job email list from LinkedIn. I unexpectedly got contacted by them about it a few weeks ago and last week had an on-site interview. They REALLY want me and I've been told an offer is coming at the end of next week. They both gave me the more senior title that I wanted and the offer is with a group I didn't originally apply for but expressed more interest in, so they are definitely pulling out some stops.

Going back to the US, and especially to the city this job is in, has been a long-term plan of mine (I never intended to be where I am now for so long, now past 5 years). I feel like the only thing holding me back is that it interrupts my infertility treatments. Things that are good where I am now: 

- I'm at a point in my current job where I'm basically the boss and I can easily disappear whenever I need to for doctor appointments, work at home around appointments, plus infertility is considered a chronic disease here, so it is within my full rights to take as much sick leave as I need for it (although I've not taken much). It's also good while dealing with the stress of IF, to have relatively little stress at work vs. starting at a new place which opens up a whole new bottle of stress.

- My husband is not a US citizen and he would also need to immigrate which takes time, but he could in theory visit while waiting to get his visa (if he needed to say, give a sperm sample to freeze at least) and it's likely this will only be maximum of 1-2 months apart anyway since I think we would qualify to get some expedited processing. 

- If I do ever succeed at the infertility treatments, I can get up to 1 year paid parental leave. But I'm getting to the point where I don't know if I can wait here forever for something that may never happen - that would now require staying here another 2+ years to take advantage of it and I don't think my husband would last here that long anyway.

- After being on a long wait list, I can finally start public IVF treatments at earliest in January (you get 3 fresh IVF cycles plus all frozen embryo transfers from those cycles up to either having the first child, maxing out those cycles, or reaching age 40, for FREE minus about $600 in drugs per year). I could get in a maximum of only one fresh cycle before I would have to start the new position because they would require me to start by mid-late February. Since the public could still not have room for me in January, at worst I would have to pay about $5k for a new fresh cycle privately.

I am currently waiting to hear anything about the benefits. The HR guy told me he'd send me a health care brochure (they have a choice between Kaiser and Blue Cross plans, I know no other details currently) and I told him I need the FULL plan details. He seemed a bit weirded out by that request, no idea why because I would ask for that even if I weren't undergoing infertility treatments. Glassdoor shows one person reporting they offer ""fertility assistance"", whatever that means. It's in a state with an fertility treatment mandate however the mandate uselessly explicitly excludes IVF, so I'm pretty sure there will be very minimal IVF coverage if any. This position will likely pay a good deal more than what I'm making now, net, but I have no idea if the difference would cover both the doubled cost of rent there vs where I am now, and the cost of 1 or more cycles of IVF out-of-pocket. And my husband would be unemployed when he gets there, whereas he has a decent job where we are now. However he's not too happy there and I'm not sure how long he can hold out in it. If he could get a job in the new area relatively quickly, our combined income would definitely make this a competitive choice, even with the doubled rent and paying for IVF out-of-pocket.

What I'm totally not sure about is - could I bring this up as part of the negotiation? Has anyone done this before, ever? I think I might stand a chance with this - they seem REALLY keen on hiring me, and I feel like I don't necessarily have much to lose bringing it up, considering the non-desperation of my situation right now. Or would it just be too weird, since it would imply I may also need to take parental leave in whatever form they offer/don't offer in the near future. I would need some flexibility on the job for sure with going to all the appointments and I'm not sure it's helping anyone if I don't bring it up. Opinions?!  I'm so sooooo torn about what to do. I also may not really need IVF and would consider just doing more IUIs. They worked for me 2 out of 4 times so far, but I keep miscarrying, so I thought IVF was a reasonable next WTF step but my first one last cycle totally failed with only one blast transferred on day 5 that didn't take, and nothing good enough to freeze.

They worked for me 2 out of 4 times so far, but I keep miscarrying, so I thought IVF was a reasonable next WTF step but my first one last cycle totally failed with only one blast transferred on day 5 that didn&#39;t take, and nothing good enough to freeze.</p>

Just wondering if there would be any interest in a December/holiday gift exchange!
I would do all the work in pairing people off (could also arrange for pairings of people in the same country/area if shipping cost is an issue) for a small but meaningful IF gift exchange. I think it would also require some proof that you’re a member of the subreddit for security reasons (posting for at least 30 days/no suspicious behaviour etc). I just thought since so many of us could use a little cheer/pick-me-up this might be a nice option :) We can put a $ limit on it and there’s no pressure to take part, but I for one would really enjoy selecting a gift for a fellow barren bitch this holiday season!

I'm 21 years old and in March of 2018 I will turn 22. For the past 2 years my partner and I have been unsuccessfully trying for a baby. My partner is 28 and as shallow and stupid as it sounds, I honestly thought the problem would be him.



After testing I was diagnosed with PCOS and prescribed with clomid. I don't want to jump the gun here as I've only been on clomid for 5 months but I'm concerned it isn't working and our next step will be IVF.



I live in the UK and we have an NHS that provides us with free healthcare. Under NHS guidelines I am NOT eligible for free treatment on the NHS until I turn 23 regarding IVF. This in itself isn't a problem because my boyfriend is pretty well off, we are financially comfortable and stable and we can easily afford to fund ourselves, however it has me worried that if we do need to go down the IVF route within the next year most clinics will refuse to help us because of my young age.

<p>I first had my AMH measured in the fall of 2014. I was thirty years old at the time, and my result was 2.1 ng/ml, or 19.2 pmol/L. A teeny bit low for a thirty year old (according to my clinic), but nothing to set off any alarm bells.</p>

<p>I had my AMH measured again in March of this year, having just turned 33 years old. This is where things get weird, because the result was 3.6 ng/ml, or 33 pmol/L. </p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>Any insight would be hugely appreciated. Thanks ladies!</p>
