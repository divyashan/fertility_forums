My husband and I did our first IVF this month and second beta came back great yesterday. Numbers were doubling like they're supposed to. I was just about to relax and begin enjoying this ride for once when I started to bleed pretty heavily that night. It started around 6:00pm and I immediately rushed out of the house like a bat out of hell trying to figure out what to do. I called the doctor (already left for the day), I called my husband (he didn't know what to do), and finally ended up sobbing in the parking lot of a nail salon.

My doctor called me back about 15 minutes later and told me it could be a few different things (Implantation bleeding into a blood vessel, residual bleeding from the transfer that's emerging because everything down there is filling with blood vessels for the baby, and of course, there's always M/C on the table).

We're right in the timeline for implantation bleeding, but this was heavy and dark and I passed what looked like tissue this morning. Not to mention the cramping. It's gotten better since this morning, but I still have dark red blood that fills up a pantyliner. I mean, it's literally like I'm on my period with a moderate flow. Sometimes it lessens, but a few hours later it usually cramps and bleeds again. 

I worry that my body is forcing this baby out of me and there's nothing I can do but wait. Every time I move my heart just sinks because I feel either another cramp, or I can tell there's more bleeding. I called the nurse again this morning and she told me the same thing. She tried to reassure me that she's seen worse and women go on to have healthy pregnancies, but I just don't know. She said there's no reason for me to brace for the worst just yet, especially since that second Beta was good. That Beta is sort of the last glimmer of hope left on the table. But I'm skeptical.

I go back in for another Beta in the morning to see if I'm still doubling normally. Has anyone ever experienced this kind of thing this early on? With either a good or bad outcome?

I've been off of birth control for about a year, but my husband and I have only been trying in earnest since November.  I went to the doctor in February after several 70+ day cycles, and was diagnosed with PCOS after seeing that both my ovaries are full of small cysts. My husband's SA came back perfect; so all of the issues are with me. 

My OBGYN started me on provera (taking pill 8 today) and femara.   

I'm praying that the drugs will work because if they don't we have an added struggle that there's no RE's in the entire state, so IUI or IVF would require us to travel outside of Alaska to seek treatment (taking vacation time and money that we don't necessarily have right now). 

I've pretty much had to stop going on Facebook all together because I can't scroll through more than 5 posts without seeing a picture of a friends baby bump, newborn or toddler.  And the icing on the cake is, I can't even stand to talk to my sister because she starts every conversation these days with ""When are you going to have a baby?""

The day I ovulate is irregular and changes considerably from cycle to cycle, but my luteal phase is not.  I have been irregular all my life, but it's almost always been short cycles.

So one cycle on Clomid, I ended up with a 21 day LP.  The next cycle, on Femara, 34 days (and developed some cysts that resolved themselves but probably affected the LP.)  

This cycle, my baseline FSH skyrocketed to over 50, and so no go on medication. My RE also talked and told me that given my numbers and results so far (I never got more than one follicle, which I was doing on my own) the further medical intervention has a low chance of working with my own eggs, so currently I am not, technically working with the clinic right now.

Anyway, so it was back to peeing on sticks.  Surged. Took a HPT 15dpo. Negative. Now I'm at 21 dpo and still have not had my period yet.

So maybe none of it was the medication and my luteal phase has suddenly decided to become weirdly long?

I'm not quite sure what to do. I should probably take another HPT at some point, but it seems fairly unlikely that it will be positive--not to be a symptom spotter but I don't have any, and it's not like I tested early or anything. I don't know if my super-high FSH is essentially doing to my body what the Clomid/Femara was doing and leaving me with this long LP. I'm not sure if the clinic will see me since I am not, technically, doing anything with them this cycle, although a phone call can't hurt and, of course, I could call my regular doc.

How come it seems everyone else around me gets pregnant by snapping their fingers and get to pop on to baby number two while I suffer through invasive tests and hormones only to have an empty womb and empty arms.</p>

<p>Last night I cried over a baby being born in a show I was watching. Tonight I&#39;m reading a series I enjoy and there&#39;s a pregnancy mentioned there too and I&#39;m jealous of fictional characters. Now that it&#39;s March we&#39;ve officially been trying for 6 years ... when is it my turn?</p>

She said if the response is going to be this low, they will cancel the cycle.  When I pressed for a % that this will happen, she hedged and said that because of my age (30) there might be more follicles that will come up.  

They had me on a Lupron protocol (10 units) and I will have to continue taking it (5 units)

Has anyone been here before?  Can I develop more follicles? Or this cycle a scrub?

What is your ""sex"" schedule like after your trigger? What does your Dr. recommend? 

Ours has been trigger between 6-8pm, sex that night, skip a day and then sex the next morning. So I trigger Sunday night, had sex and are supposed to do it Tuesday morning as well. 

My husbands sperm is apparently good so this time I think we're going to throw in one tonight and maybe another Tuesday night if we can manage. I know they say to wait a bit to ""build sperm back up"", but...meh. I feel like I need more than 2 shots at this!


ALSO - I have ZERO mucus right now. When asked what I can  use (because I DO need some sort of lube - ouch), they just told me to use Astroglide.

I'm 23. I have a very serious bf, we've been dating for almost two years and are planning on getting married eventually. Not for awhile, though. No rushing here! When I first met him he said he never wanted kids. I wasn't even sure that I wanted kids. But as we've grown together we've discussed and agreed that we could imagine ourselves as parents if we ever wanted to try. Obviously not something immediately relevant to our relationship but they're good conversations to have.

Ok, this is where my fun started. When I was 15 I looked like I was 10. My mom and I found this amazing adolescent gynecologist and through series of tests and scans and whatnot I was diagnosed with hypogonadatropic hypogonadism. All that means is that everything in the factory is there but I have no ""on"" switch. My body cannot produce estrogen on it's own. Which has a series of health issues, one of the biggest ones as I get older is bone health. I've been on estrogen pills and birth control since then. I've developed and gone through puberty and gotten my period and all that fun stuff. At one point I was taken off all pills to see if it had ""kickstarted"" my system and it was a no go. All estrogen has to come from outside my body.

It was always assumed that I might have difficulty conceiving. To a 16 year old that seemed like light years away. I've had the same amazing gynecologist since then and now that I'll be graduating college and moving on with my life she suggested meeting with a fertility doctor (or is it infertility?). Mostly to explain to me what I would likely have to go through if I ever did want to pursue having children. 

Ho-ly shit. I don't even know where I'm at anymore. I feel entirely overwhelmed and lost. It made me realize that yes, I do want kids eventually. There's several emotions that I'm feeling. I feel like I've lost somebody but there was never anybody there? It's a very strange emotion to have when I'm not even close to actually wanting kids at this age. I feel like I don't deserve to be with as amazing of a bf as mine is. He deserves a woman who can give him everything he wants and I can't do that. At least not without a couple thousand dollars worth of help for a ""maybe"". One of the biggest things that I'm dealing with is that he's always said it's the cost of raising a child that scares him the most. Just raising a child! And now I told him if we ever do want kids it'll be how many thousand just to try?! He was amazing, as always. He said he doesn't care how much it'll cost. If it's something we want to pursue then we'll make it work (he's 29 btw. 6 years older than me). But I still feel like I don't deserve him anymore. And as far as all of the potential procedures...it all sounds so uncertain and scary. Everything seems like a ""try"" and a ""maybe"". 

It's just...I don't know. I'm sorry this has turned into such a rant. But I needed to get it out. I don't understand this huge feeling of loss and the sense that I'm already a failure at something the other women in my family are so successful at. I'm so overwhelmed at the sticker price of just a single ""try"". Graduating college with less than $500 in my account, trying to start a life and deal with student loans for the next how many years, and then this?? I'm so mad and it feels so random and unfair. We had an extended family gathering tonight and I got the usual questions of,""How's bf?"" ""What're you doing after college?"" ""Oh, you guys are that serious?"" ""Oh, wait till you have kids..."" All of a sudden that well meaning comment that somehow always ends up being said in some form or another is now ripping my heart out. This isn't something I've ever felt before and I don't understand how to deal with it.

If you've made it this far in my rant thank you. If anybody has any advice please, I'll take anything. And again, if this isn't the right subreddit please point me in the right direction.

My 88 year old grandmother recently had a heart attack, and though she is doing okay, the family is beginning to have to consider her care as her health will probably not return to what it was before and she will probably no longer be able to live alone. She has two children, my mom and my uncle. My mom will bend over backwards to give my grandmother the best life she can. While I know my uncle cares about his mother, he went on a rant the other day about how he worked hard to get to where he is today (which I give him, he's very dedicated to his job and has truly earned all the luxuries he has) but that he shouldn't have to spend this time of his life caring for a parent, and isn't going to. He's not even going to put money towards her care; once her money runs out, she can go to the county run facility and live off someone else. I don't know who exactly runs the facility or where the money comes from, but as I understand it it's like charity care. My mom wouldn't let this happen, so it's not really a big deal, though we are all pretty disgusted that my uncle could be so selfish. So there's been a lot of discussions lately about caring for your parents in their old age.

Suddenly the other day the thought hit me that if I don't have children, who will be there to help me? I imagined a scenario where my husband had passed away before me, and I was so alone. This was such a big, black thought that it really upset me, and I haven't been able to let it go.

Now, I'm certainly not saying that I want to have kids just so there'll be someone to take care of me when I'm old, please don't get me wrong. I guess I'm just seeing part of what ""family"" means to me, and I'm just mourning the loss of the idea of ""a family of my own"" and what I thought that would be like. I expected the sense of loss and disappointment, and am expecting that they will fade with time (at least I sure hope they do!). However I can only see this feeling of being alone as growing as I grow older. It's like this big black hole that I'm being sucked into, and I can't stop it or do anything about it.

I had an ultrasound today since I had some severe abdominal pain with my last cycle. My RE wanted to check things out and see if it was okay to continue with another cycle of letrozole (7.5mg). So based on the ultrasound, it would be absolutely fine to go ahead with another month. But they said that if I wanted to skip a month solely based on my symptoms last month, that that was reasonable.

I'm just not sure if I should skip or not. I had one day of moderate to severe pain for about 5 hours. After that, I've only had little twinges of pain - intermittent, fairly mild.

It is now 9:00am the following day and I still have not received a call. I have decided to no longer call that office and instead will take to some healthcare sites to leave the reviews I think they deserved.  Thank you all for the support, it has made me feel just understood and respected.

I really need to vent about my OBGYN office. They had me in tears this morning because of how rude they were.  One thing I should also state is that I am a medical biller and have been for 5 years, so Healthcare is my industry.

For three weeks I have been trying to get my medical records, I know that things can get hectic but I need them for my consultation with an RE this Monday.  So as soon as I made the appointment (Monday three weeks ago) I called them and asked them to send my entire medical history over, I may have fibbed and gave them my fax number but that’s not really the point and that doesn’t hurt them either.  They said no problem they will be sent before the end of the day, side note my fax is virtual and the faxes come to my email so no matter when they would have sent them I would know. By Thursday I haven’t received anything. Come Friday, late morning, I receive a call from their office, I am thinking they must have lost the fax number and are calling me for it. I answer and they are asking me about a bill they claim I never paid. Being a medical biller I save confirmations for EVERYTHING! I tell her that there must be an issue with their system as I paid $xxx.xx on 1/13/15 and give her the confirmation number, she apologizes and says thanks. Before she hangs up I say “I called earlier in the week for my records but they haven’t arrived and the appointment is coming up and they will cancel on me if I don’t have them.”  She apologizes confirms the fax number with me and guarantees they will be out that night. Nope no fax ever sent.

Next week comes and goes, by this past Tuesday (the start of the third week) I call and conversation goes as follows: 
M- “Hi this is mistressSHAKE and I still have not received my records” 

O- “I sent that fax myself and I know that it went through.”

M- “Oh, well they said they have not received them, could I give you the fax number to their other office and see if maybe they receive them there. Maybe they are having a problem with that fax (718)xxx-xxxx. Here’s the other number (212) xxx-xxxx. That’s their main location so I am sure they have things in a better order there.”

O- “Fine I will send them there today, have a nice day”
(Footnote (718) is my work fax because I work from home and (212) is that actual office fax where there is a legit machine).

Come Wednesday there is nothing there, my coworker is starting to feel bad for me as she is one of the few people that know I am seeing a specialist for fertility issues, tells me to give her the office number and that she will call them. She calls and says “Hi I’m Mary from Dr. Specialit’s office and I am calling because we still have not received medical records for a mutual patient mistressSHAKE.” They hum and hah at her ask for the fax number AGAIN and she says “I will send by this afternoon”. Nothing comes by 3:00 and the office closes at 4:30 so Mary calls again and asks where the records are. They tell her they had some kind of emergency and that she will send them before she leaves tonight at 8:00.  Mary says no problem.

Thursday morning (today) she comes in to nothing in the fax. By this point I am irate with them. This is going on 2 weeks and 5 days with no records sent. I call and whoever answers the phone our conversation goes as follows:
M- “Hi this in mistressSHAKE and I am calling about my medical records”

O- “You know this is getting ridiculous”

**This set me over the edge, I probably could have been a little nicer but I am beyond upset**

M- “You know what you’re right this absolutely is getting ridiculous. I have called several times in the last three weeks to get these records, and I have given you two fax numbers there is absolutely no way that both of those faxes don’t work and something is not going right at your office. I need these notes as they cannot treat me without them.”

O- “You’re talking about what was sent to Dr. Specialist’s office right?”

M- “Yes I am and I gave you two of their fax numbers and nothing has showed up I am going to lose this appointment if I don’t get them this information”

O- “Well I never actually sent it to Dr. Specialist’s office this week so I will send it today”

M- “Like actually today, or today like every other day?!”

O- “Today”

M- “Thanks bye”

My coworker calls me about 20 minutes later to say that the fax machine just kicked on and the cover sheet is from their office. A sigh of relief is had and I think “Thank God this is over with!”  Not so fast….
The records that they sent are two copies of the same pap smear, one blood result and two handwritten pages of follicle measurements and the dates they were on, THAT’S IT?! Where’s my clomid doses? Where’s the third sonogram? What about all the urinalysis? My husband’s semen analysis results? It’s an 8 page fax with 3 pages being my HIPPA release. Not a single dictation from the doctor, none of my family history and nothing that my new RE would actually want to see. I tell my coworker and she calls them because at this point I am crying because of all this. They tell her we have nothing else and Mary quoted  “Good luck with that patient because she has been such a bitch”. Mary says, “I think that’s enough from you and I will have the doctor get in touch although I will let him know that your office is pretty incompetent and not very good at keeping files so we will just do all the testing for this couple ourselves”

Now Mary, didn't want to tell me about the bitch comment because she knew that I was very very upset to begin with but she also felt that I needed a new doctor so she did tell. 

I called the office and demanded to speak to the office manager, the young lady that answered the phone could hear that I was crying and asked if I was okay, I said “No I am not OKAY! I am devastated by the way your office is treating me. I am 27 years old and struggling with infertility, I am looking for my notes to see about taking on the next step and this is what I have to deal with?! Just get the office manager on the phone.”  The office manager was a nightmare, she told me they have been nothing but friendly and quick with everything. She said that it was her I spoke to this morning and I replied with “So you were the one that said ‘This is getting ridiculous’?!” and she started to back pedal, “I never said that, well then it must not have been me you spoke to this morning” “No one in this office would use that kind of language” yadda yadda yadda. She then decided that she didn’t want to speak to me because I was too upset and she couldn't deal with someone that was crying and that the Dr. would call me when he gets into the office at 2:00 this afternoon.

I hung up the phone and balled my eyes out. I was hiding in the garage because I didn’t want my in laws to hear all of this, even though we told them what was going on (they live with us) I just felt like I didn’t want to burden them.  My husband came down from his office because he could hear me crying through the ceiling/floor.  He told me that I shouldn’t let it bother me and that we would find a new doctor but all I could say was that my RE is going to cancel on me because I couldn’t get what they needed. I am never going to have a baby because everything we did last year is going to have to be done again with a doctor that can give me the records for it. 

I called my specialist and started to cry a bit on the phone with her as I apologized for not getting what they needed. She told me not to worry that they will work with what I have and give me a referral to the OB that works across their hall. Dealing with someone that is actually nice and caring made me start to cry more as all I could say was thank you. So I am still going to see them I told them I will take in the little bit of info that they sent me and that hopefully we can work on this together. 
I still can’t shake this awful feeling of disappointment and hurt that happened, but maybe it was for th best and this new team of doctors will be better for me in the end.

Moreover, fragmentation could also be caused by a sperm quality issue or my reaction to the combination of meds during stimulation. I guess I just don&#39;t trust my RE. </p>

<p>Any experience with fragmentation issues?</p>

And I'm looking online and such, but it's hard to really get solid information, especially when the same clinic might have 10 different websites.  

Now, my father--before he knew we were working with a fertility clinic--had randomly told me (several times) about a friend of the family's son who had gone to India for gestational surrogacy. So I think, well, that same clinic would like do donor IVF, so that sounds like a good starting point.

Except, I don't have any way to contact this guy.

I could ask my parents, but I don't want them involved at this point... my mother has a habit of taking over, declaring herself an expert (whether she is or not), refusing to listen to what anyone else wants because she knows best, and then should things go wrong, it's everyone else's fault. (There was this time when she wanted me to come with her to a wedding, didn't tell me, and then when I has plans and wouldn't go, it was my fault because I didn't care enough to ask her about a wedding I didn't know I was invited to, and then there was a lot of being screamed at.)

I happen to have the guy's mother's email address, so I could ask her, and I know she would happily help me... I have no idea how often she looks at email though, and she's friend with my mother, so while I could *ask* her not to say anything yet, I can't guarantee that she won't. And my mom would be livid that her friend knew first... not that this should stop me, but it's uncomfortable.  I can handle my mom when I have to, but I mostly don't want to.

(with 2 years before of loosely trying, without any kind of contraceptives) Got tested and found out I have a mild case of PCOS, it's actually low enough that it can't be totally classified as ""officially"" PCOS but whatever. And so this cycle we've had medicinal help and monitoring.

Started off with Clomid (50mg I believe) and then had the ovulation shot when I was ordered to. The entire time the doctor said things were looking fine. I followed all of my doctor's instructions to the letter except for one...

He said to not take a pregnancy test until at least 12, if not 14, days after ovulation because the hormones in the shot can actually get you a false positive. As you can probably see where this is going, I took one early anyway.

I just wanted to see, you know? See that these tests can show me other things than negatives and ""NOT PREGNANT."" I was fully aware that it could and would very likely be a false positive. I understand this. It would not mean that I was actually pregnant.

But it came back negative...? It's only been about 10dpo so I should still have that hormone ""juice"" running around in my system, right?

Has anyone else done this and gotten a negative?

A little background on me: irregular periods as a teenager, some suspension that I had PCOS, my endocrinologist put me on metformin.  Eventually I went on birth control pills for a couple of years.  When I went off of them I didn't have a period on my own for a year.  Went back on pills, then got a mirena.  No period with mirena, got it removed in October.  Had some withdrawl bleeding, then two months later a very light period.  Lots of spotting, then another light period, followed by constant spotting and now a really heavy period. We've been having unprotected sex since the end of December, but not super frequently (3 times last month).

With the non-stop spotting I went to my OB/GYN.  Given the possible PCOS in my past, he's eager to send me to a RE.  I was expecting to have to try for a year before I got a referral, but apparently not.  I thought they were officially referring me because of menstrual problems, but today the nurse called to tell me they had scheduled the appointment and was talking about insurance coverage for infertility.  Would they really label me ""infertile"" when we haven't even really been trying and I recently got a mirena removed?  They told me I could go back on the pill to regulate my periods, or if I want to get pregnant I can go to the endocrinologist.  Is this normal?  It seems like we're moving really fast.  On the other hand, if I truly am infertile, I guess it's good to get started sooner rather than later.

At this upcoming appointment, what kinds of tests should I expect them to do?  They said today they'd do an ultrasound.  I'm assuming also some blood work?  Is it likely that they'll want to test my husband's semen?  Will they really bill my insurance for infertility and not menstrual irregularities?

I told my sister we were not using contraception because I was excited and she's my best friend.

So I am staring down the barrel of my third (and most likely final) IUI, and they are talking about just repeating my protocol from last cycle (lowest dose of Femara, CD3-7, with ultrasound on CD10 and Ovidrel trigger/IUI).  I only developed one follicle on Femara last cycle.  My husband's sperm is consistently ""outstanding"" according to SAs and post-wash counts, so I am very frustrated with the thought of going through another IUI all for nothing.

All of the research I have found says the best results for IUIs occur with 2-3 mature follicles at the time of trigger.  If I am going to go through the hassle of missing work (when my office is incredibly short-staffed and my boss gives me shit about taking sick time) I don't want it to be for nothing.

Is it reasonable to insist on some type of modified protocol at this point, or an adjusted dosage to see if I can respond better this cycle? I don't want to go through the hassle of switching practices (to a FAR more inconvenient location, with an unknown RE) to move onto IVF until I feel that I have exhausted every avenue under the RE I adore.  And doing IVF will necessitate missing SO much work, and everyone at work will be angry with me.

Other than that, I have been reading some stuff about how more than three IUIs is reasonable to try if the issue has been anovulatory PCOS and sperm counts are good - should I try more than three IUIs? My insurance will pay for up to 6 total.  I can keep doing IUIs through my current RE.

All of this just feels so hopeless.  Finding quality, peer-reviewed research on PCOS and fertility treatments other than just Clomid is near impossible, and honestly what research there is clearly means nothing because I had the best odds possible on my last Clomid cycle with IUI (three follicles, post-wash sperm count over 50 million) and got my period early to boot.

I am 32 and we were planning for a family, so we were tracking my temps and cervical fluid, which were textbook for ~6 months. We waited to try for a baby (and now I am full of regret) because 3 months ago I apparently stopped ovulating. No temp spike, changes in cervical fluid started seeming random instead of on any kind of schedule. Pregnancy tests were negative. I also felt a lump in my lower abdomen around the same time this started. 

I made a Dr. appt and my period started the day before I was seen, but it was abnormally heavy. The doctor told me my uterus was like that of a 16 week pregnancy but that I was NOT pregnant. An ultrasound revealed simple cysts on both ovaries and tumors (presumably fibroids), the biggest of which was 8cm. I was told I needed surgery and that it would be ""massive."" I was given the phone number of 2 surgeons and ended up seeing both and they both said the lack of ovulation had nothing to do with the fibroids at all and that they weren't worried about the cysts as they typically resolve without intervention. 

One of the surgeons wanted to do power morcellation to remove the fibroids, but I was scared of cancer as this all came on so suddenly and I don't have any family history or significant risk factors. The doctor ordered an MRI with contrast that I had a few weeks later and even more presumable fibroids were found plus the cysts were still in place. 

On my follow-ups, they checked my TSH, prolactin, did a finger stick for my iron levels, which came back normal. The surgeons were pushing to operate as soon as possible so I could get pregnant, but at this point it had been 2 months with no ovulation. Now on months 3 of the bizarre cycles, I don't even have a period at all and no sign that it will be returning any time soon (I'm on day 46). The doctors (and this is at three different offices now) just tell me that they don't even worry about it until it has been 90 days and then they would just give me a shot to force me to have a period. I told them I didn't want to have surgery that would (in their words) fillet my uterus (open myomectomy) in the hopes of being able to get pregnant if I am not even cycling, but all of them want to argue when I ask for blood work (like estrogen, FSH, free T4, etc.) and act like I am being unreasonable for wanting to figure out what is going on.

Again, I know I should be grateful but for my upcoming IVF cycle on gonal-f, menopur, ganirelix, etc. I had called my prescription  plan (express scripts) to verify what the cost would be. It was something crazy like if I ordered through mail order home delivery, all the meds would be like $500 total and if I ordered through a retail pharmacy, they would be over $6k. So I was crazy excited and went through what they told me what the right process for home delivery. Cut to now, a month later, I am being billed almost $7k which seems pretty high considering they're paying half the cost. I'm just livid.

It's one thing if you told me from the beginning that it'd cost that much, but that's not the case. I've been googling and saw the average cost for meds for IVF is 3k to 5k so it's just so weird.

121,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So over the this TTC period of my life my period has been fairly regular with a few exceptions. I usually know it's coming because I can't sleep the night before due to extreme gasinous and I spot for one day prior. Right now I am anxiously awaiting my next cycle so I can start my FET process. I was supposed to get my period Monday and I did start spotting Monday. I also had trouble sleeping the night before but it was a bit different. I kept waking up extremely hot and sweaty. I initially attributed it due to the fact that temperatures are warming up a bit where I live. Well it's Wednesday night and I am still spotting and still having night sweats. Last night I did have a short period of normal sleep due to exhaustion. I am so tired the past couple nights I can barely function. 

Desperate, I turned to Dr. Google. 

Besides a bunch of diseases and whatnot, my symptoms could mean a. Perimenopause and possible b. Early pregnancy. Now, the only way it could be early pregnancy is if I ovulated late and if I ovulated late it would be very early pregnancy. But premenopause? That has me freaked the fuck out. From what I read it could just be a shift in hormones too and I'm thinking that's my case, that this period is just more messed up than usual, but what the hell?! I can't help but think of all the scenarios from the extremely good to extremely bad and I hate it so god damn much. I refuse to test until I am at least a week late and I hate that I am actually considering I could be pregnant, that my hopes are actually a bit raised. 

If anyone has any insight on night sweats or what I am going through I would appreciate it. From today's off topic I know I am not alone with having to go through the turmoil of a period that is late. Gaaaaaah. 

TL;DR: Night Sweats. Late period. WTF. 

Edit: so my period is a master troll just like some mentioned. Got it today! I'm angry and relieved at the same time. Looking forward to my FET too.

I usually know it&#39;s coming because I can&#39;t sleep the night before due to extreme gasinous and I spot for one day prior. Right now I am anxiously awaiting my next cycle so I can start my FET process. I was supposed to get my period Monday and I did start spotting Monday. I also had trouble sleeping the night before but it was a bit different. I kept waking up extremely hot and sweaty. I initially attributed it due to the fact that temperatures are warming up a bit where I live. Well it&#39;s Wednesday night and I am still spotting and still having night sweats. Last night I did have a short period of normal sleep due to exhaustion. I am so tired the past couple nights I can barely function. </p>

<p>Desperate, I turned to Dr. Google. </p>

<p>Besides a bunch of diseases and whatnot, my symptoms could mean a. Perimenopause and possible b. Early pregnancy. Now, the only way it could be early pregnancy is if I ovulated late and if I ovulated late it would be very early pregnancy. But premenopause? That has me freaked the fuck out. From what I read it could just be a shift in hormones too and I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s my case, that this period is just more messed up than usual, but what the hell?! I can&#39;t help but think of all the scenarios from the extremely good to extremely bad and I hate it so god damn much. I refuse to test until I am at least a week late and I hate that I am actually considering I could be pregnant, that my hopes are actually a bit raised. </p>

<p>If anyone has any insight on night sweats or what I am going through I would appreciate it. From today&#39;s off topic I know I am not alone with having to go through the turmoil of a period that is late. Gaaaaaah. </p>

I haven't had a proper period since August (not unusual for me), so I saw my GYN last month. She did the standard lab work and rx'd prometrium for 10 days with a progesterone test on cd21. All right. So I got bleeding and all that was good. CD 21 was yesterday so I got my labwork done, despite the shitty weather. Today the nurse called to ask if I did have withdrawal bleeding and I confirmed. She said my progesterone level was 0.06. 

:(

Ok, so I know what that means, but what does it *mean*? Am I going to have to repeat this process for the next 6 months? Do I get to skip ahead a few steps? Am I going to need meds? What questions should I be asking? How far away from google should I be staying? 

I'm 23, almost 24. 

On the bright(ish) side, my husband, who has been telling me my concerns about infertility are ""overexaggerated"" because he has ""super sperm"", is finally taking it seriously.

I ovulate on my own (just late), so what would they bring to the table? We also decided not to do more IUIs. I don't think they are helping at all either since there is no MFI going on. 

So the only pinpointed issue was the low progesterone- so we'll try for a few more months with just progesterone support. This summer if we're still unsuccessful we'll move onto IVF with a new clinic. We're relocating to a new state within the next few months anyways. We are going to miss out on full coverage for IVF but I *think* the new insurance I'll have may cover it with a $50k lifetime cap.

I'm going to get better more regular sleep and hopefully moving will be a huge increase in our quality of life and lower stress. We'll see what happens...

155,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I know this is more of a personal decision, but I need help weighing my options and making a decision.  

IUI #2 just failed.  We were on 100mg of clomid but I was only able to take four doses because I had visual disturbances.  I think this means that I can't take clomid again.  We did an HCG trigger and then progesterone 2x per day.  We triggered with a 19mm follicle and a 17 or 18mm (I can't remember).  

IUI #1 was with 100mg of clomid for five days, HCG trigger with a 19mm and a 17mm follicle and a bunch of smaller ones.  Plus progesterone twice a day. 

Before that we had two cycles with 50mg of clomid, used OPKs and TI. I ovulated, but I ovulated ""late"" on day 19 and 17. 

HSG was clear, hub's SA was good.  Motility is very good and the last IUI had over 100 million sperm.  I am not sure IUI is adding anything for us at this point. I've always ovulated on my own, but its been late (like cd 23-26). 

We've been pregnant twice before- both times naturally, both times very quickly.  The first miscarried and we got pregnant right away afterwards and had a healthy pregnancy. That was five years ago now.  I think back then I had an 11-12 day LP and ovulated around CD17 or so.  I went back on BCP and went off of it in Feb 2014 and we started trying again. I noticed late ovulation and a LPD so we saw an RE in September.  When they did my CD21 blood work (at 7dpo) my progesterone was a whopping 1.2.  It was the day before my period and although it typically indicates no ovulation I always got a +OPK and regular periods, just a short LP. Now here we are. 

The voicemail the nurse left telling me my beta was negative asked what we want to do next and if we had thought about moving forward to IVF. 

I don't know what to do.  I feel like its soon to be moving onto IVF... its been just a year and I struggle taking that route without knowing or understanding what is wrong.  If there was a concrete reason I think I'd have a much easier time making that decision.  I feel like my body just forgot what the f its supposed to do. I don't understand why it's struggling now. On the other hand, the growing age gap between my son and any future kid is getting way past where I wanted it to be and I'm feeling anxious about it.  Plus, I'll be 30 in August.  I know its not that old, but still. 

I'm not sure its worth it to do another IUI.  With no MFI it seems like it's kind of a waste.  Insurance covers it but honestly the last cycle completely sucked with all the ultrasound monitoring- the RE's office was always running significantly behind and I ended up missing a lot of work. I don't feel like its worth it. Additionally, we are in the midst of relocating and my husband is spending weeks at a time out of state... so the timing to get in for an IUI may very well be impossible. 

I was thinking about maybe doing a medicated, unmonitored cycle? I know they'll want to do a baseline u/s, and I'm pretty sure I can't take clomid anymore so I don't know what I could take. Injectables freak me out a bit, and I don't know if they can be taken unmonitored? Someone has mentioned Famera and I might ask them about that.  Then we can just do OPKs and TI? I can go back to temping... 

Does anyone else think its kind of pointless to do another IUI? Is it adding any chance of success for us? Any thoughts on just doing a medicated TI cycle?  Maybe we should just move onto IVF and take a few months to move, find a clinic, and then do so... but in the meantime, I feel like I need to do *something*.

Little bit of history with these drugs:

Last summer I tried 3 unmonitored cycles on Clomid.  I got my usual LATE LH surge (CD20-22) and no pregnancy

New doctor - have laparoscopy for endometriosis and have had 3 cycles with femara and hcg trigger shot

The results with Femara have been mixed.  I am getting a follicle to trigger.  First cycle it was huge on CD 14 and we triggered.  Cycles 2 & 3 didn't end up triggering until CD 17 and much smaller follicle.

Also, last two cycles I have had a cyst on day 1 that we had to make sure was gone before I started medication.

So on to my question - this cycle I think we are going to try IUI (will meet with doctor on Sunday to decide).  Sunday is CD 5 and we are monitoring to make sure that my 4 CM cyst on my ovary has resolved before I start the drugs.

Now we had discussed trying clomid since femara results have been unremarkable.  Part of me likes the idea of trying something new, part of me is worried about making a change on the month we may do IUI.

Feeling so beyond heartbroken. 19th cycle failed of TTC. 4th cycle of Clomid. 3rd IUI. Why can’t I get pregnant? I feel like every ounce of my being is consumed with getting pregnant and it’s getting in the way of living a happy life. It even invades my dreams and nightmares. The TWW is the absolute worst because I really feel like every single moment, I’m wondering, “Did it work this time?? Am I pregnant??” I don’t know how to keep living like this. The heart break each month is too much to take. 

We haven’t told many friends, because it’s just hard for them to understand. Plus talking about it makes me cry, so it’s easier just to avoid the subject. Seeing pregnant friends and friends with babies on FB just kills me. I should probably delete my account. But I hate myself for feeling so jealous. I can’t help it though. Am I crazy?! One of my best friends just got engaged and decide to start trying, just for kicks. What do you know, one try and they are pregnant! HA. Universe, you are cruel. It’s stupid of me to think, “IT’S JUST NOT FAIR” but that’s all I can think. And I feel horrible because I should be HAPPY for my friends.
