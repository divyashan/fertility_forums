Here's the thing: I have a healthy and happy and perfect son who just turned 2. I got pregnant on birth control on my honeymoon. The pregnancy was super easy aside from braxton hicks every day. I had an IUD inserted when he was 6 weeks old. Just after his first birthday, I had it removed to start trying for our second child. I got pregnant right away. We went on vacation and on our last day, I started spotting. My husband and brother in law (both physicians) assured me it was normal in the first trimester. I just so happened to have my first 9 week ultrasound scheduled the day after we got back from vacation. The baby looked healthy and the heartbeat was strong. They said I only had a 5% change of miscarrying since we saw a good strong heartbeat. I went in a couple days later and the bleeding site as shrinking and the heartbeat was still good. The bleeding stopped for a couple days and then when it started again, they had me come in right away for another ultrasound. No cardiac activity. The baby stopped growing just days after we saw the good strong heartbeat. I had a D&amp;C at the end of July 2015. I had a period in August and got pregnant again in September. We did an early ultrasound (at a high risk OB office with very high grade equipment) where there was a sac but no baby around 6 weeks. I had another D&amp;C at the end of October 2015. My regular OB then did the Anticardiolipid, Lupus anticoagulant profile and thyroid test. All came back normal. 

I wanted a break from all of this and decided to try to track my ovulation with a period app and not have sex during my fertile time. We had sex 2 days after my period, right before New Years and somehow conceived. I called my OB the minute I found out and started doing progesterone suppositories right away. She never tested my progesterone levels but said she would do this regardless of what they were, so we did it. I go to my 9 week ultrasound (I had NO bleeding and was sure this pregnancy would take since I was so much more symptomatic) and the baby was measuring 9w4d with no cardiac activity. Again. I had a 3rd D&amp;C on March 3rd. My pregnancy test at my 2 week post opp was positive so they have been tracking my HCG levels until they go down to 0. It's now been a month and they are still at 30. Doing another draw next week. This never happened in my other two miscarriages. 

After this 3rd D&amp;C, they sent the tissue to a lab for chromosomal karyotyping. The baby tested positive for Turner's syndrome, which is one of the leading causes of miscarriages. Nothing came back as being wrong with my husband or I. So now I have an appointment with a RE this coming Thursday. My husband is a physician so I kind of know what to expect, but I'm wondering if anyone here has been in a situation like this? Perfectly normal pregnancy and then....this. I know I am lucky in that I seem to get pregnant very easily and that's why I don't want to step on anyone's toes here because I know you may be going through the frustration of not getting pregnant at all, and please know I am so sorry for your struggles and I don't want to seem insensitive. I just have never known anyone to have this problem after a totally normal pregnancy before and I just had to reach out somewhere because I'm feeling very alone in this RPL world. 

EDIT: I just found /r/miscarriage and will post this there as well. I hope it's ok that I leave this here for a little while at least, just in case someone has been in my situation before. Thank you. &lt;3 

UPDATE: So I wanted to give an update on my appointment today with my reproductive endocrinologist. My blood work has all been normal and great. My egg count is great. John and I are both chromosomally fine. He did a saline ultrasound and went into my uterus with a camera and said everything looks great except for 3 very small polyps and one larger flat one that was covering a large part of one uterine wall. If my 3 babies had tried implanting there, it wouldn't be sustainable with life and therefore miscarried. We have an answer for my last loss (Turner's syndrome), but this could very well explain the other two. So now I have to have a surgery much like a D&C. It's general anesthesia and they'll dilate my cervix, go in with a camera and take out the polyps. Then we are free to try on our own again!

8,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So I actually posted about this friend of mine awhile ago. She had a baby in January and was/is one of those super annoying people on social media that think they are the first woman ever to have a baby. I mean, I love her dearly, but she can be really annoying. She only posted professionally done photos of her when she first had the  baby with hastags like ""soamazingbeingamama"" and shit like that. The bridezilla equivalent of the pregnant woman. Everything pinterest-perfect. 

She has PCOS and had always been so sure she'd have a hard time getting pregnant. Back last summer when I emailed her freaking about a bit about how everyone was pregnant and it wasn't working for us (before I knew about our MFI), she was actually just newly pregnant at the time . I knew she was trying but she never confirmed it to me. (we're in different countries, btw) I found out about her from  their gag-worthy facebook announcement. She called me right after the announcement and said she was sorry she didn't get to tell me in person, but it had been so stressful because it had been 9 months of actively trying and she never got me on the phone. (yes, 9 whole months) 

So I didn't really find out till this past November that we might have major fertility issues, and it was then confirmed we had to do IVF in January, which was when she had her baby. So I found lots of excuses why I would miss our regular calls over the last few months.  

Anyway, we finally talked tonight. I was really unsure about telling her about IVF or not - I had only told her vaguely that my husband had some bad results back in November. 
Anyway, she tells me about her baby, how he's a difficult and fussy baby (sort of shocking she said that). She tells me her birth/delivery was awful. And asks about us.
I never really told her details, just that it wasn't going to happen naturally for us and vaguely tell her that we are still doing tests, etc, and then she's saying, ""I know it's not the same, but it was really hard for us when we were trying. I feel for you."" And I want to smack her. 
So I never told her the full truth - I'm on cycle 2 of IVF now. Part of me feels like I don't want to tell her until I get to announce something positive, preferably in an equally annoying fashion on FB.
 I know it's petty - but I feel like I want the upper hand. A little part of me feels like by not telling her now, I gain some sort of control over this shitty situation. And then whenever she mentions her interminable 9 WHOLE months of trying before conceiving naturally, I can be like, ""oh, you were SOO lucky to have it SOOO easy."". 
God, I'm turning into a crazy bitch.
She's the only person I feel this way about, but I think it's because she made such a big fucking deal about how HARD it was for HER, and how NOBODY can understand, etc. I feel like me and my IVF can put her back in her place!

How messed up is that?

*Update - thank you all you awesome people for making me feel better. It's nice to know I'm not alone and I'm not crazy! I'm not going to waste any more energy feeling guilty about it - she should! We've decided that besides those few that know, we are not going to tell anyone else, at least until we are (hopefully) done with the process. And then it would be some close friends who may be in a similar situation. Who needs the stress of more dumbass comments?
-Oh, and in my post above, I forgot to mention this -  she actually said ""have you considered adoption? because towards the end we had a serious talk about it when things were looking bad."" I guess that was around month 7? grrrrrrrr

Back last summer when I emailed her freaking about a bit about how everyone was pregnant and it wasn&#39;t working for us (before I knew about our MFI), she was actually just newly pregnant at the time . I knew she was trying but she never confirmed it to me. (we&#39;re in different countries, btw) I found out about her from  their gag-worthy facebook announcement. She called me right after the announcement and said she was sorry she didn&#39;t get to tell me in person, but it had been so stressful because it had been 9 months of actively trying and she never got me on the phone. (yes, 9 whole months) </p>

<p>So I didn&#39;t really find out till this past November that we might have major fertility issues, and it was then confirmed we had to do IVF in January, which was when she had her baby. So I found lots of excuses why I would miss our regular calls over the last few months.  </p>

<p>Anyway, we finally talked tonight. I was really unsure about telling her about IVF or not - I had only told her vaguely that my husband had some bad results back in November. 
Anyway, she tells me about her baby, how he&#39;s a difficult and fussy baby (sort of shocking she said that). She tells me her birth/delivery was awful. And asks about us.
I never really told her details, just that it wasn&#39;t going to happen naturally for us and vaguely tell her that we are still doing tests, etc, and then she&#39;s saying, &quot;I know it&#39;s not the same, but it was really hard for us when we were trying. I feel for you.&quot; And I want to smack her. 
So I never told her the full truth - I&#39;m on cycle 2 of IVF now. Part of me feels like I don&#39;t want to tell her until I get to announce something positive, preferably in an equally annoying fashion on FB.
 I know it&#39;s petty - but I feel like I want the upper hand. A little part of me feels like by not telling her now, I gain some sort of control over this shitty situation. And then whenever she mentions her interminable 9 WHOLE months of trying before conceiving naturally, I can be like, &quot;oh, you were SOO lucky to have it SOOO easy.&quot;. 
God, I&#39;m turning into a crazy bitch.
She&#39;s the only person I feel this way about, but I think it&#39;s because she made such a big fucking deal about how HARD it was for HER, and how NOBODY can understand, etc. I feel like me and my IVF can put her back in her place!</p>

<p>How messed up is that?</p>

<p>*Update - thank you all you awesome people for making me feel better. It&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m not alone and I&#39;m not crazy! I&#39;m not going to waste any more energy feeling guilty about it - she should! We&#39;ve decided that besides those few that know, we are not going to tell anyone else, at least until we are (hopefully) done with the process. And then it would be some close friends who may be in a similar situation. Who needs the stress of more dumbass comments?
-Oh, and in my post above, I forgot to mention this -  she actually said &quot;have you considered adoption? because towards the end we had a serious talk about it when things were looking bad.&quot; I guess that was around month 7? grrrrrrrr</p>

I had my pre-testing (mock transfer/hysteroscopy) appt last week, and it all went well, and I went through the checklist with the nurse to make sure we were all set to have our plan made at the meeting this past Monday. Great! (The procedures themselves were marked by incompetence on their part -- among other things, the doc didn't know my history and changed anatomy b/c of cancer surgery, making the procedures more complicated than necessary super-long -- but I'm kind of over that for now. Am filing a complaint and trying to move on.) 

So, yesterday I got a message from the nurse asking if we wanted to do PGS... which we had already confirmed. But apparently they needed it in writing/typing. So I wrote today to ask about our plan, and apparently we have gotten bumped to this coming Monday's scheduling meeting. (The clinic only does IVF scheduling on Mondays.) But it's not just a delay of one week, but of several weeks -- b/c I'm currently on birth control and have been for almost 4 weeks (it took that long to get the pre-testing appt), and apparently there is a limit of 5 weeks. So I have to stop birth control, have a period, start again in a week, and then wait for the edu appt, and then the stimulation shots (the nurse said maybe lupron?). This would put us with a retrieval of the week 5/9. But my husband can't be here that week b/c of work, so we have to put it off for another week. Last week, I was told that retrieval would likely be around 4/23, and now it will be week of 5/16. 

I know that in the grand scheme of things, 3 weeks isn't such a big deal... but it is just so frustrating to have bureaucratic delays when there are already so many bodily delays as part of this process... we learned in late Feb that IVF was the next step, and were originally told that late March could be the retrieval. And, I have June travel plans for work and I don't know how those will be affected by a May retrieval. 

This process is just so agonizing.  I was kind of enjoying my emotionally detached phase last week, but this has thrown me back into the crazy weepy emotional phase. :/

UPDATE: I found out today that the whole process has to be pushed back one more week, but this time it's me making that decision -- a super-cool work opportunity has arisen that means I need to travel on one of the days I was supposed to be having a pre-retrieval monitoring E2 blood draw. So I am able to change the date to accommodate something good in my life. Even though I'm annoyed at the delay, I'm feeling empowered since it's *me* that's making it!

14,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Our IVF #1 was cancelled in March due to low response to stims. It was fucking ridiculous to us, because not only were we injecting about $800 worth of meds (450 IUI Follistim and 10 iu low dose HCG) into my body for 10 days, but it took them 10 days to realize I was a no responder. So we wasted about 2 months on this, unnecessarily. 

After taking a break from infertility to regroup (in which I drank approximately 20 drinks in one evening and was hungover until 7pm the following day, oops), we had out WTF conf call with our RE to go over what happened last cycle/ get some closure/ get a game plan for next time.

Here's what happened:

- Dr. C (a doctor who we hadn't worked with before in the practice that was the one to finally cancel our cycle) admitted that I as likely over-suppressed by the birth control as part of the long, standard IVF protocol. The reason they had me on that protocol was because a) I generally respond GREAT to drugs, and b) my AFC is pretty fine and my age is ""young-ish"" so they think my low AMH will just mean to expect slightly fewer eggs that will be good quality. 

- Dr. C apologized for the fucking nightmare of a cancelled cycle, and implied that maybe the other doctor we were seeing in the practice should have put the breaks on way before day 10 because there was LITERALLY NO RESPONSE.

- Dr. C will now be our doctor point of contact! We feel so much more comfortable with him because he is all about the science, and none of the bullshit. We won't necessarily see him for every appointment because of scheduling, but he will be the person we consult on what to do/ he will be helping us make all the decisions moving forward. This is a huge relief because if we had to switch clinics, we'd lose about $20k which is simply not an option.

- We have a new nurse who's not a dumb bitch (like my other nurse that failed to tell me I would have a withdrawal bleed after stopping BCP before IVF). HOORAY

Next protocol will be micro dose lupron. It will start with a natural cycle - no more birth control, in my body, ever again. Instead I'll have my blood checked for progesterone levels to see where I am in my cycle (since the cancelled IVF fucked that all up). Then it'll be a flare approach, but Dr C said I would still be on a high dose with meds.

So- that's what's going on. I feel sort of...detached...I didn't expect to feel this emotion, and I'm sure it will shift, but....who knows.

I see that you're all so helpful to each other, so I was hoping this might be somewhere I can turn for advice throughout this process.  Thank you in advance!

I had my egg retrieval (first IVF) on Monday and have been in so much pain ever since.  It's such a weird feeling of pressure and pulling, and every time my bladder is full I'm in agony because there just doesn't seem to be enough room for my bladder with my huge ovaries in the way.  Sorry for the TMI, but I also haven't been able to have a BM even though I've been taking stool softeners.  Last night, all the pain got significantly worse and I couldn't sleep all night.  I'm not sure if it's because it's been days of constipation, or if I have gas (though gas-x hasn't helped one bit), but last night was worse than any other night.  I don't have any of the serious symptoms they want me to look out for that would indicate OHSS, but I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to feel better. 

The pain is especially bad when I try to sleep at night, and even worse last night (Thursday night). I'm using a heating pad, which is nice, but not enough. I've also been propping a pillow underneath my bloated/swollen belly to help support my ovaries when laying on my side, and this helps a little.  When I'm lying on my back, I put the pillow under my knees because lying flat is horrible.  These techniques have worked for me in previous nights, but last night it barely worked, and that was even after taking 2 Tylenol 3s.

I see that you&#39;re all so helpful to each other, so I was hoping this might be somewhere I can turn for advice throughout this process.  Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>I had my egg retrieval (first IVF) on Monday and have been in so much pain ever since.  It&#39;s such a weird feeling of pressure and pulling, and every time my bladder is full I&#39;m in agony because there just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough room for my bladder with my huge ovaries in the way.  Sorry for the TMI, but I also haven&#39;t been able to have a BM even though I&#39;ve been taking stool softeners.  Last night, all the pain got significantly worse and I couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because it&#39;s been days of constipation, or if I have gas (though gas-x hasn&#39;t helped one bit), but last night was worse than any other night.  I don&#39;t have any of the serious symptoms they want me to look out for that would indicate OHSS, but I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anything I can do to feel better. </p>

<p>The pain is especially bad when I try to sleep at night, and even worse last night (Thursday night). I&#39;m using a heating pad, which is nice, but not enough. I&#39;ve also been propping a pillow underneath my bloated/swollen belly to help support my ovaries when laying on my side, and this helps a little.  When I&#39;m lying on my back, I put the pillow under my knees because lying flat is horrible.  These techniques have worked for me in previous nights, but last night it barely worked, and that was even after taking 2 Tylenol 3s.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m starting Provera tonight, and then back to bc and into another cycle. I&#39;m supposed to be packing to leave for a vacation to Maui tomorrow, but we cancelled it for this transfer. </p>

He suspects the issue is that my fallopian tubes aren't working correctly, and says he'd generally recommend straight to IVF but my insurance requires 6 cycles of climid + timed intercourse and/or climid + IUI before approving payment for IVF. He says he'll fight with insurance to try to get them to drop that, but he has only successfully won a fight with my insurance company once.

I do have insurance coverage, but it's $25,000 lifetime, which seems like it would be mostly eaten up after 6 IUIs and medication, which is really frustrating when it seems like the chances of the IUI working is low but the insurance company is making us do it. It's also of course frustrating to have to waste 6 months on things that probably won't work, but I guess there may be a small chance that my tubes aren't the issue and if that's the case, the IUI is worth a shot.

Has anyone gone through something similar? I'm frustrated and sad because I was hoping IVF wouldn't be the answer, but hopeful that if my tubes are the actual issue then IVF will bypass them and my chances are good otherwise. This is assuming some more tests come back normal, of course, and we don't know 100% that this is even the issue.

Of course when we were young we had some fights and some brief periods of time where we didn't get along, but for the most part, having a sister close to my age has been the greatest thing.

Hi! I've been lurking and commenting for a few months but I decided to wait to intro until we were fully back in the game. Which we are :) 

A little history. I'm 42. Never wanted children in my twenties or early-mid thirties. Probably could have easily gone my whole life without wanting them had I not met my husband, whom I met when I was 38. Ironically, he didn't want kids either. But we changed that desire for each other. Started trying when I was 39. Gave it six months. I was fortunate in that I had lots of IRL friends who had waited until their late 30s early 40s to start trying, so I had first-hand experience with the struggles. Had us in front of an RE right after our 7th month of trying. He has super sperm. My numbers were not great but age appropriate. (AMH 1.14, FSH 12, AFC 8-10). We decided we weren't interested in the prolonged struggle we'd seen our friends go through and skipped directly to IVF. I'm a low responder, but we got lucky on round one. The day before my 40th birthday my daughter was inseminated with ICSI and we will be forever grateful that we took the most aggressive route. But we also know how lucky we were.

We are committed to giving her a sibling and prepared to go all the way to donor, likely at the end of this year if nothing happens. We've actually got a donor under contract for the year - basically paying her egg honorarium so she doesn't commit to another cycle with somebody else until we're sure. She could really score from this, basically getting paid by us for two cycles instead of just one. In the meantime, we're going to try one or two more IVF cycles with our own eggs. 

We had tried a cycle in August that failed. I regret that cycle. I had an AMH draw done while breastfeeding to try to baseline how critical it was for us to rush into the sibling game. It came back .44. My RE was adamant that AMH isn't impacted by breastfeeding. Literature backs that up. Cycle wasn't awful. Retrieved 6 eggs, 5 fertilized, all were 8 cell A grade on day 3. Transferred 3 on day 3. The fourth arrested on day 5 right before freeze and I didn't end up pregnant. OF COURSE had another blood draw done the following November and my AMH was back up at 1.20. So we all know the science is still a work in progress here, but of course I deeply regret that rushed cycled. Everything about me said not to do it. That my body didn't feel healthy and ready to be pregnant yet. And while there are a thousand reasons that cycle could have failed, I refuse to believe that the fact that that I'd stopped breastfeeding two months before and given birth 7 months before was not a factor.

So I took some time off. I enjoyed the holidays (read: DRANK LIKE THE BOOZE WAS GOING OUT OF STOCK). In January I started those beloved ""life changes"" to prime up for our last hail mary IVFs before donor. For me that means no booze, no coffee, slightly reduced workout schedule, coq10, maca, vitamin d, wheatgrass and acupuncture. I also stopped working to be home full-time with my daughter, which despite what thousands of mombies will tell you is absolutely easier and less stressful than having a job, so I'm hoping stress relief will play a role. Just scheduled hub's beloved SA as the last step before a (hopefully) late April/Early May cycle. I have a girl's weekend in Austin over Memorial Day, so if this cycle fails I'll have a go-to stress reliever!

I'm generally pretty laid back about fertility. Actually, in the ""most unpopular opinions ever"" category I don't consider myself somebody who suffers from infertility. Just somebody who made choices about how I was going to live my life and now has to deal with those consequences. 42 is 42. Biology is biology. Though obviously I'm ever-hopeful we'll get lucky and catch that one magic egg again! 

Anyway, that's me if you were ever wondering when I jumped in on threads. I'm always cheering for everybody.

<p>Hi! I&#39;ve been lurking and commenting for a few months but I decided to wait to intro until we were fully back in the game. Which we are :) </p>

<p>A little history. I&#39;m 42. Never wanted children in my twenties or early-mid thirties. Probably could have easily gone my whole life without wanting them had I not met my husband, whom I met when I was 38. Ironically, he didn&#39;t want kids either. But we changed that desire for each other. Started trying when I was 39. Gave it six months. I was fortunate in that I had lots of IRL friends who had waited until their late 30s early 40s to start trying, so I had first-hand experience with the struggles. Had us in front of an RE right after our 7th month of trying. He has super sperm. My numbers were not great but age appropriate. (AMH 1.14, FSH 12, AFC 8-10). We decided we weren&#39;t interested in the prolonged struggle we&#39;d seen our friends go through and skipped directly to IVF. I&#39;m a low responder, but we got lucky on round one. The day before my 40th birthday my daughter was inseminated with ICSI and we will be forever grateful that we took the most aggressive route. But we also know how lucky we were.</p>

<p>We are committed to giving her a sibling and prepared to go all the way to donor, likely at the end of this year if nothing happens. We&#39;ve actually got a donor under contract for the year - basically paying her egg honorarium so she doesn&#39;t commit to another cycle with somebody else until we&#39;re sure. She could really score from this, basically getting paid by us for two cycles instead of just one. In the meantime, we&#39;re going to try one or two more IVF cycles with our own eggs. </p>

<p>We had tried a cycle in August that failed. I regret that cycle. I had an AMH draw done while breastfeeding to try to baseline how critical it was for us to rush into the sibling game. It came back .44. My RE was adamant that AMH isn&#39;t impacted by breastfeeding. Literature backs that up. Cycle wasn&#39;t awful. Retrieved 6 eggs, 5 fertilized, all were 8 cell A grade on day 3. Transferred 3 on day 3. The fourth arrested on day 5 right before freeze and I didn&#39;t end up pregnant. OF COURSE had another blood draw done the following November and my AMH was back up at 1.20. So we all know the science is still a work in progress here, but of course I deeply regret that rushed cycled. Everything about me said not to do it. That my body didn&#39;t feel healthy and ready to be pregnant yet. And while there are a thousand reasons that cycle could have failed, I refuse to believe that the fact that that I&#39;d stopped breastfeeding two months before and given birth 7 months before was not a factor.</p>

<p>So I took some time off. I enjoyed the holidays (read: DRANK LIKE THE BOOZE WAS GOING OUT OF STOCK). In January I started those beloved &quot;life changes&quot; to prime up for our last hail mary IVFs before donor. For me that means no booze, no coffee, slightly reduced workout schedule, coq10, maca, vitamin d, wheatgrass and acupuncture. I also stopped working to be home full-time with my daughter, which despite what thousands of mombies will tell you is absolutely easier and less stressful than having a job, so I&#39;m hoping stress relief will play a role. Just scheduled hub&#39;s beloved SA as the last step before a (hopefully) late April/Early May cycle. I have a girl&#39;s weekend in Austin over Memorial Day, so if this cycle fails I&#39;ll have a go-to stress reliever!</p>

<p>I&#39;m generally pretty laid back about fertility. Actually, in the &quot;most unpopular opinions ever&quot; category I don&#39;t consider myself somebody who suffers from infertility. Just somebody who made choices about how I was going to live my life and now has to deal with those consequences. 42 is 42. Biology is biology. Though obviously I&#39;m ever-hopeful we&#39;ll get lucky and catch that one magic egg again! </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s me if you were ever wondering when I jumped in on threads. I&#39;m always cheering for everybody. I wish I could a)give every dog a loving home, b)give every person who wants to love a baby a baby and c)make better mac and cheese (recipes welcome). Best of luck to everybody!</p>

I was waiting to talk to my RE today before I posted in case she had any additional info for me, but instead my nurse called and set up a followup appointment. I had my lap yesterday. While she told me that it would likely be about an hour, I believe I was under for at least 2 hours. Once she got in there, she found stage 3 endo. There are photos [here](http://i.imgur.com/GRCe3zV.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/JI2Fbmz.jpg) if you want to see the nitty gritty for yourself.

I can only relay what Hubs told me which is that my tubes were clear (you can see blue in the picture). That is no surprise since my HSG back in August was clear, too. There was an adhesion that had somehow made one of my ovaries point downward so my RE said even when I was ovulating, I only had a 50% chance that it came out of the good one. As far as I know, there were no adhesions directly on my ovaries or fallopian tubes, thankfully. 

After surgery, I couldn't urinate on my own, so they had to insert a catheter. My RE also put in about a liter of ""Adept Adhesion Reduction"" to make sure that my ovaries did not stick to anything else. Because of that, I am still *extremely* bloated today. I've been slowly oozing liquid from one of my 3 incisions which is gross to say the least. The pain at this point is pretty manageable except for the shooting shoulder pain. Holy shit you guys. Earlier that pain was like an 11 out of 10 while my abdomen is like a 3. Fucking nuts. I really hope the gas escapes me **one way or another** so that I can not have this pain anymore.

As for next steps, I'm on femara right now and will go in for a midcycle scan in a week or two. I'm looking forward to a consult with my RE and finding out how much this increases our chances. Hubs asked if this changes our current plan, and she said she still wants us to try two more IUIs before moving onto IVF.

Lastly, I outed myself completely on FB tonight. I'd been wanting to do it for a while. I woke up from surgery yesterday and was just fuming angry that I had this pain 2 years ago and multiple doctors had missed it. So I posted the list below. All of this will be old news to you, but it felt really good to put it out there into the universe, and I thought some of you might appreciate it. Love to every single one of you.

--------------------

Some of you know that Hubs and I have been struggling with infertility for the past two years, others don’t. Yesterday, I had a laparoscopy where I found out that I had stage 3 endometriosis (there are 4 stages) and had several adhesions lasered from my abdomen.


As this is now the third problem I am battling, I figured I would give some advice not only for those of you that are struggling with infertility, but also for anyone who is struggling with health issues and not receiving the care they deserve. Without further ado:


1. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. How often do we ignore our body when it is trying to tell us something is wrong? It is so easy to get wrapped up in work and family and all of your life’s busy schedule. Are you experiencing chronic pain? Do you have a toothache that won’t go away? One joint or muscle that always seems to be injured? Do you keep getting a cold over and over again? Stop ignoring it. I told my OBGYN two years ago that I was having painful periods. This was when I was on birth control, so they were not that bad, but they were still bad enough for me to ask her about the pain because I hadn’t ever had periods like that before. Well, fast-forward to last month. My pain was so severe that I was lying on the bathroom floor and couldn’t walk and Hubs had to take me to the ER. I knew two years ago that something was wrong, but my doctor dismissed it, so I did, too. Had I listened to my body, we may have been able to catch my endometriosis early on and I would not have been in pain every month. For those that don’t know, endometriosis is when uterine tissue grows outside of a woman’s uterus elsewhere in their abdomen. It can be extremely painful and even lead to a woman’s ovaries or fallopian tubes being removed. I am lucky that it was not on my reproductive organs, but others are not so lucky.


2. BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE. In two years, I have now found that I have Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (thyroid doesn’t work properly), PCOS (anovulation and cysts on my ovaries), and now endometriosis (see above). This has been two years of first pushing someone to actually diagnose my PCOS. My original OBGYN would not even let me get blood work even though I had extremely irregular, long cycles. She also would not prescribe me any medication for my thyroid despite the blood work that showed I needed it. I finally came to my current doctor who gave me a prescription for my thyroid literally the day she met me at my consult. She listened to me when I said something was wrong and didn’t ignore my concerns. This was after over a year of dealing with doctors who dismissed me, and it was the biggest relief to have my concerns validated. Even my current doctor, while amazing, still failed to connect the dots between my pain symptoms and endometriosis. For a third time, I had to educate myself on potential causes for abdomen pain and then request a laparoscopy.


3. SEE A SPECIALIST. Without a doubt, my struggles have become much more manageable since I began seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. Both women and men who are having fertility problems, PLEASE search for a local clinic and make an appointment with an RE. As for other health issues, go to your GP and then get a referral to a specialist. If you continue to go to the wrong kind of doctor, they may misdiagnose you or just not be aware of current procedures and possibilities. Save yourself time, physical distress, and emotional energy and just go to a specialist. I cannot emphasize this enough.


A few more specifically about INFERTILITY:


4. TEST BOTH PEOPLE. We are lucky that the issues are only on my side of this equation. But keep in mind that one third of infertility is due to female issues, one third is due to male issues, and one third is due to both male and female issues in the same couple. Women will feel that it is likely an issue on their side just because we think of all things related to conception, birth, and child rearing are related to women. Again, save yourself some agony and have the male partner get tested. Just like with women, the are medications and procedures that can help men with Male Factor Infertility. It’s worth it to make sure both of you are healthy.


5. NEVER SAY “JUST RELAX.” There is nothing about “relaxing” through this process that would have made me ovulate on my own or make my endometriosis go away. It required medical intervention in the same way that a chronic illness would. You would not ask someone with some sort of chronic problem to just relax the problem away. This is one of the most dismissive things you can say to a couple struggling with infertility.


6. LOOK FOR BETTER INSURANCE. I am extremely lucky to work for a company that has many insurance plans. Knowing that we had already paid out of pocket last year for all of my diagnosis and treatment, I contacted my HR and pressed them to find out which of our plans (if any) had fertility coverage. I am paying a lot more out of pocket, but if (and probably when) we move to IVF, I will have a lot of it covered.


7. DON’T ASK WHY PEOPLE DON’T “JUST ADOPT.” Adoption is expensive. Surrogacy is expensive. IVF is expensive. They are all expensive. Believe me, if a couple is dealing with infertility, they’ve discussed all of these options amongst themselves. We have medical options to be able to conceive our own child, and we want to pursue that option first while we still can. I’ve heard some people call this selfish or “playing God.” But to my mind, having a child at all is a selfish act to fulfill a biological need. And as for it being an act of God, so is treating cancer or giving someone an organ transplant. Unless you believe those medical miracles should also be ignored, please don’t assume that fertility treatment is wrong.

Again, save yourself some agony and have the male partner get tested. Just like with women, the are medications and procedures that can help men with Male Factor Infertility. It’s worth it to make sure both of you are healthy.</p></li>
<li><p>NEVER SAY “JUST RELAX.” There is nothing about “relaxing” through this process that would have made me ovulate on my own or make my endometriosis go away. It required medical intervention in the same way that a chronic illness would. You would not ask someone with some sort of chronic problem to just relax the problem away. This is one of the most dismissive things you can say to a couple struggling with infertility.</p></li>
<li><p>LOOK FOR BETTER INSURANCE. I am extremely lucky to work for a company that has many insurance plans. Knowing that we had already paid out of pocket last year for all of my diagnosis and treatment, I contacted my HR and pressed them to find out which of our plans (if any) had fertility coverage. I am paying a lot more out of pocket, but if (and probably when) we move to IVF, I will have a lot of it covered.</p></li>
<li><p>DON’T ASK WHY PEOPLE DON’T “JUST ADOPT.” Adoption is expensive. Surrogacy is expensive. IVF is expensive. They are all expensive. Believe me, if a couple is dealing with infertility, they’ve discussed all of these options amongst themselves. We have medical options to be able to conceive our own child, and we want to pursue that option first while we still can. I’ve heard some people call this selfish or “playing God.” But to my mind, having a child at all is a selfish act to fulfill a biological need. And as for it being an act of God, so is treating cancer or giving someone an organ transplant. Unless you believe those medical miracles should also be ignored, please don’t assume that fertility treatment is wrong.</p></li>

My sister's getting married in a month. Back in August she found out I was trying and was upset that I was trying to have a baby because she didn't want me to be too far along to travel the 1000 miles to her wedding (lol). Her best friend had also just told her she'd be trying in January of 2016. She didn't want both her maid of honor and matron of honor pregnant at the bachelorette party.

Well best friend, who we'll call B, got her Mirena removed in January and had a bleed right afterwards. Then 60 days go by without another period. She's got a history of irregular cycles, but that was still really long. She went to the doctor and got a blood test to verify she wasn't pregnant and a prescription for Provera. She finished that up like 2 weeks ago and never had a period. So she takes a test last night. Whattayaknow. Positive. Blood test today shows levels high enough to suggest a 6-7 week pregnancy.

I love this girl, really. I'm closer to B than my step-sister. She's like a second blood sister to me. But how the hell does that happen? She rarely ovulates on her own normally, stops her birth control, and gets pregnant the first fucking cycle. When do I get some of that luck?

I'm not mad at her. I'm happy for her. But I'm furious at the god damned universe for not letting me get pregnant first. I've been trying for a damned year. *I'm* supposed to have the next baby.

I'm 34, my husband is 31. We've been married about 2 years and are trying to have our first. We tried for 15 cycles before having tests done. We got the results last week, and it was a *doozy* of an appointment.

We learned that I have a mild case of PCOS. I had no idea because I'm largely asymptomatic, but given the PCOS, my egg reserve is low. The number of follicles that matured during my test cycle was also low.

We learned that I have a fibroid inside of my uterus that's around 1.5 cm. It's located inconveniently at the top near the tubes, so it could be causing problems with implantation. They recommended removing it with a hysteroscopy followed by a 2-3 month recovery period.

We learned that my tubes have some scar tissue and are partially blocked on one end. This apparently has caused them to be wider than normal in places, and thinner than normal in other places, according to the HSG. The doctor referred to my tubes as ""your problematic tubes"" for the rest of the appointment.


In spite of all of that about me, our largest infertility factor is my husband's numbers. His count was 0.2 million/ml and motility was 5%.


The number 1 suggestion was IVF, ICSI, and PGS. Number 2 was a sperm donor. Number 3 was ""wait and see"" if husband's numbers get any better.


We've decided to go with the IVF option. We'll be doing a couple of cycles of egg retrievals up front, banking the results, then doing the hysteroscopy, then waiting for recovery, then FETs. They quoted me a success rate for the FET of 75-80%, which seems high to me, given what I know about IVF.


So, following their instructions, I've started birth control as of yesterday (which I'm somewhat emotional about). Today, I found out from the clinic that their next IVF cycle isn't until mid May, so pretty much nothing will happen until then. I am beyond pissed off at them. They didn't set expectations at all for this, and if I had known, maybe it would have been possible to try naturally for another month? At this point they've given me no information about scheduling, and I'm **devastated** that nothing will happen for so long and that I'm on birth control for that time. The secretary says that they sync up a bunch of people so they can bring in extra staff for the IVF cycles. It makes it sound like it's purely a cost cutting mechanism for the clinic, and it's making me and my husband both doubt whether this clinic is the right one. If I have to do multiple retrievals, does that mean I'll be waiting for 2 of their IVF cycles? It sounds like it, but I have no idea. They've been very bad at informing us. We have an appointment to go over the financials on Thursday, and then I'm supposed to get a calendar. Maybe it'll get better? Are there really 7 weeks of medications I need to take to prep for this?

This clinic hasn't been the best at setting expectations in the past either. With my HSG, they told me that there would be some pain and prescribed pain killers for me to take, but there was no mention of sitting up in a pool of blood. I didn't even bring my husband because I didn't think it was going to be that traumatizing. They left me in tears to clean myself up afterwards and get dressed.

/u/nikipie: PGS results ~4/19, FET late April or early May

/u/Been_there_done_this: Calling clinic tomorrow (again) as we still haven't gotten an IVF appointment (we were supposed to be scheduled for April, guess that is out of the question now).

/u/spartannugget: Getting our protocol on the 5th for IVF Cycle #1

/u/audpgh1: Starting BCP to suppress for embryo transfer in early May. Haven't been on this shit since my early 20s...

/u/MBel312: Saving money, losing weight, and taking birth control in prep for a donor cycle in June.

/u/larla77: Next RE appointment April 20. This will be my second appointment where we are getting test results back and discussing next steps. Based on last test results my doctor has ruled out everything except donor egg or embryo. We're going to take a break and then pursue adoption.

/u/Hippopotamuscles: Waiting for a period to happen by April 6th, and if not, provera. Endometrial Receptivity Array/Biopsy after that.

/u/hostess_cupcakes: PGS results around April 6.

/u/Baby8My8Ball: On my 12th cycle ttc, will either test or start bleeding this week. first ever dr. Appointment to discuss infertility is the 11th.

/u/vrimj: PGS Results from cycle 3 ~4/4 or 4/5 otherwise benched for recovery from bleed.

/u/elcagey2: Still waiting post-varicocelectomy, hoping to resolve neuro consolt waiting game and meet with RE to get ducks in a row once results from varicocelectomy are in. Aiming to lose 5lbs this month.

/u/all7dwarves: BC for mid May FET, starting Lupron ~4/15

/u/Alces_alces_: Natural cycle. Meet with urologist on April 11 to discuss Mr Alces's SA results 4 months post surgery.

/u/linminimal: I'm in embryo quality limbo of a freeze-all cycle.

/u/DraegotheLady: I am waiting for my first appointment with my new RE on the 21st! Thinking we will probably move on to IUI.

/u/hsgabaker543: Waiting for my first RE appointment. It's on Monday so its not that long of a wait.I feel resigned to the fact that we'll end up doing IVF due to tube problems. I hope we like the doctor! I'm nervous to meet him.

/u/Pickle_Juice_Slurper: guess the plan for April will be to have my WTF conversation with the RE and plan what's next.

/u/daybeforetheday: Waiting for my period so I can start IVF #2. Will probably need progesterone to get it to come.

/u/MoonIsMadeOfCheese: My first FET is scheduled for May 4th, and I'm starting Lupron again today.

/u/Veranique: Due to get my period around 4/7, then starting on the BCP for two weeks before beginning Lupron

/u/baumee: Returning to me RE April 18, after being cleared by oncology. Should be getting a prescription for Clomid to finally get things rolling!

/u/ggmbb: RE appointment today, with our new, second-opinion doctor. We'll likely start our next cycle in May. 

/u/weird_scout: Back on birth control for April and gearing up for FET #1 on May 16.

/u/pinksultana: I  am waiting for O time, last cycle I ovulated 6 days early which is great in terms of cycle improvement but I completely missed the fertile window. So gearing up and fingers crossed husbands ED will allow us at least a few attempts in the window. This is cycle 32 and I'm exhausted. I'm also in process of losing weight to start fertility treatments when I reach the BMI requirements (68lbs down, 15 to go)

76,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone,
  I've been a long time lurker on this sub, as my husband and I have been trying to conceive for roughly 3 years now.  I figured I might as well introduce myself since I've started wanting to comment more and more and don't want to be some rando who wants to share but that you know nothing about.  

So here's what brings me to this wonderful sub:  we've worked with two different fertility clinics (one in Philadelphia, the current one in Colorado).  In Philly, we did all the ""fun"" tests (saline, HSG, sperm count/motility) with timed intercourse as well as a hormone drug that is currently escaping me for 5 months with no success.  Then we moved to Colorado and went a little more aggressive, starting with three IUIs with letrozole as well as a trigger shot, and those failed.  We are officially categorized in the undiagnosed column.  Our next step is IVF, which we will hopefully be starting in July (as long as my body and work cooperates).

As of right now, I am a nanny for a baby which has it's pros and cons.  Aside from being amazing, I get to spend all day with a perfect little being, but at the end of the day, I know she isn't mine.  I can't say I'm bitter, yet.  I have five great nieces and nephews (who all have great moms and dads who 100% deserve happiness).  Though I would be lying if I said going to Target in the morning when all the new moms are shopping isn't super hard.

So now onto the questions if you don't mind:

1) what do you say when someone tells you that you might just need to relax?  This is the comment I get the most and I am super non-confrontational and I know this is typically coming from a good place.  Not everyone has been through this and it's human nature to want to help/give advice.  I don't want to be snarky or snippy, so I was wondering if there is a good, calm answer to this one.

2) I'm making a big assumption here and assuming protocol is the same for most IVF women, but our clinic makes us come in for two weeks, every day, for blood and transvaginal ultrasounds.  How did you handle that at work?  My clinic opens at 8, which is a super bummer because work starts everyday at 8.  My bosses know about our struggle a bit, but is there a tactful way to ask for 10 late days in a row?

3) Does anyone else not love their doctor but LOVES the nurses?  Both doctors we have worked with have been rather short with us and seem to almost have a God complex, but the nurses are our saving grace.  I work with them way more often, so it's not worth getting too upset. 

Anyways, thanks so much in advance for all your help and how much this sub has already helped me.  It's just nice to know we aren't alone in this.  No matter how many numbers a doctor throws at you, it's hard not to feel alone when you don't know anyone in the real world that is currently going through it.

90,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Yesterday was my first post ever on this sub, as my husband and I are not currently trying right now so I didn't feel like it was necessarily appropriate for me to post but I saw someone asking about adenomyosis and I have it and so I commented. I got diagnosed last summer with adenomyosis after a laparoscopy and have been through a long series of medications, pelvic floor physical therapy, and an IUD that was especially hellish to insert in an attempt to get this condition under management, all because I refused to allow the doctor to remove my uterus. She reluctantly agreed to allow us to buy some time with the IUD so that husband and I can potentially have one shot in three years at having a pregnancy, although she is very against it from a medical standpoint as adenomyosis makes it very high risk - late term miscarriage are very likely and there is also a high risk of uterine rupture. I told her I understood the risks but wasn't willing to write a pregnancy off the table completely yet. Of course, we don't even know if I will be able to successfully become pregnant yet - but when that time comes I'll have to do more testing and do more med changes and meet with another specialist. My husband has been amazing during all of this, he attended PT with me and learned how to do the therapy with me, he has been awesome during the times when my pain has been less controlled, and he has been reading a lot about my condition and options for the future. It helps a lot because I work in a pediatric emergency room so I am, unfortunately, around kids all the time and my co-workers are also baby-crazy.

I had a mini breakdown at work last night because half of my co-workers are either currently pregnant or have very young children and it seemed like all they wanted to talk about all night were babies, and there I was sitting, in pain, thinking about how on Friday I have to go to my specialist obgyn again to have my current IUD yanked out since it is currently partially penetrating the wall of my diseased uterus and have a new one inserted - which is going to hurt like hell and I don't even really want it, but we have to do it to buy some time so that we can potentially have that one good shot at trying to have an ill-advised, high risk attempt at a pregnancy. After listening to them talk about their damn babies for two and a half hours I finally stormed off to another part of the department to help a different coworker who knows about my medical issues a little. Five minutes later, my charge nurse came over and asked why I wasn't in my area and I kind of snapped at her that ""some people can't talk about babies for two and a half freaking hours because they might have certain devastating medical disorders that makes such life events impossible and that hearing about it constantly is very stressful and upsetting!"" She was kind of speechless and I didn't really mean to be so blunt, especially since she has never really been rude or mean to me but I just had kind of had it and accidentally took it out on her. When I left for the night an hour later I ended up crying on the phone with my husband. It's all just so stressful.

I guess I have just been lurking on this sub because I didn't really feel like I belonged since we aren't actively trying right now, in fact my IUD means we are kind of the opposite - actively untrying, but I guess I feel like this community is one of the only ones that really does understand what it does feel like despite that.

I got diagnosed last summer with adenomyosis after a laparoscopy and have been through a long series of medications, pelvic floor physical therapy, and an IUD that was especially hellish to insert in an attempt to get this condition under management, all because I refused to allow the doctor to remove my uterus. She reluctantly agreed to allow us to buy some time with the IUD so that husband and I can potentially have one shot in three years at having a pregnancy, although she is very against it from a medical standpoint as adenomyosis makes it very high risk - late term miscarriage are very likely and there is also a high risk of uterine rupture. I told her I understood the risks but wasn&#39;t willing to write a pregnancy off the table completely yet. Of course, we don&#39;t even know if I will be able to successfully become pregnant yet - but when that time comes I&#39;ll have to do more testing and do more med changes and meet with another specialist. My husband has been amazing during all of this, he attended PT with me and learned how to do the therapy with me, he has been awesome during the times when my pain has been less controlled, and he has been reading a lot about my condition and options for the future. It helps a lot because I work in a pediatric emergency room so I am, unfortunately, around kids all the time and my co-workers are also baby-crazy.</p>

<p>I had a mini breakdown at work last night because half of my co-workers are either currently pregnant or have very young children and it seemed like all they wanted to talk about all night were babies, and there I was sitting, in pain, thinking about how on Friday I have to go to my specialist obgyn again to have my current IUD yanked out since it is currently partially penetrating the wall of my diseased uterus and have a new one inserted - which is going to hurt like hell and I don&#39;t even really want it, but we have to do it to buy some time so that we can potentially have that one good shot at trying to have an ill-advised, high risk attempt at a pregnancy. After listening to them talk about their damn babies for two and a half hours I finally stormed off to another part of the department to help a different coworker who knows about my medical issues a little. Five minutes later, my charge nurse came over and asked why I wasn&#39;t in my area and I kind of snapped at her that &quot;some people can&#39;t talk about babies for two and a half freaking hours because they might have certain devastating medical disorders that makes such life events impossible and that hearing about it constantly is very stressful and upsetting!&quot; She was kind of speechless and I didn&#39;t really mean to be so blunt, especially since she has never really been rude or mean to me but I just had kind of had it and accidentally took it out on her. When I left for the night an hour later I ended up crying on the phone with my husband. It&#39;s all just so stressful.</p>

<p>I guess I have just been lurking on this sub because I didn&#39;t really feel like I belonged since we aren&#39;t actively trying right now, in fact my IUD means we are kind of the opposite - actively untrying, but I guess I feel like this community is one of the only ones that really does understand what it does feel like despite that.

99,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. I've been a reddit lurker for a long time, but I made an account this past week just to post in this thread. I don't know ANYONE dealing with infertility and it really is lonely, so I'm hoping I can find some support here? 

My backstory: As a teenager, my periods were AWFUL. If I didn't take pain killers quickly enough, I would be on the floor unable to get up/throwing up/passing out. My mom, who apparently had similar symptoms, heard about endo and asked her doctor about it for me and my sister. He ended up seeing both of us, we both had laps, and we were both diagnosed with endo. I was 19, and I don't remember thinking it was that big of a deal. I knew endo might cause infertility, but as a college student who had NO intention of getting pregnant this fact was at the very back of my mind. I wasn't even sure I ever wanted to have kids until I met my husband during my first year of grad school. I told him about the endo and the possibility of infertility, but I kinda downplayed it - I really didn't think it would happen to me. Around our 4 year anniversary we started talking about having kids and decided that I would go off bcp after I finished my graduate degree in December of 2014 (I was 28). We were casually trying for a while until I had a really long cycle this past summer (43 days), which had never happened to me before. I met with my doctor, who said it was fine, but she put in a referral for us to see an RE when the 1 year mark rolled around just in case. I started using OPK's, temping, and really tracking things, but nada. So we went to the RE in December. Everything came back normal, although now that I've been reading here I wish I knew the exact numbers for everything so I could compare. Based on that, my RE thinks all of our problems are related to my endo diagnosis. Our insurance covers diagnostics but virtually nothing for actual treatment. We are able to get injectible meds and monitoring covered with TI but that is it. We've already done one round and I'm on my TWW for the second round.

Sorry for the wall of text, but TL;DR I have endo and we've been trying for 15 months, doing treatment for 3...

Now I have a few questions. I wonder if I should post these separately, let me know if I should?

1. According to the RE, because of the nature of endo our best chance for getting pregnant by far is with IVF. I'm on board - I want to get pregnant quickly (since this IF stuff can sometimes go on for a long time it seems) and I feel like if my endo is creating some kind of toxic fertilization environment it makes sense to bypass that bit. My husband, however, hasn't really said much about it. He is super optimistic that the injectibles + TI is going to work and basically doesn't want to make any plans about moving to IVF. I feel like this puts a ton of pressure on me since its very unlikely that it will work; I felt like a failure when we got nothing on our first cycle because he was so sure I was pregnant. I finally pushed him a bit and he told me he felt like IVF was kinda unnatural, and he didn't want to think beyond what we were doing now. He thinks I need to stay positive about it and ignore the statistics. I don't know what to do. I don't think he really knows how big of an issue endo can be (he pretty much refuses to actually read anything I give him about this stuff). I have a hard time being optimistic when our chances are so low, I want to plan for something that has a better chance of working! Anyone have any experience explaining things to your spouse? Or getting them on board with treatment?

2. I'm a runner and for basically the whole time I've been TTC, I've also been running a lot. I trained for and ran my first marathon last spring, ramped up my mileage from about 30-35 miles per week to 45-50 miles per week over the summer/fall, and then trained for and ran my second marathon in February (during my first round of treatment, I triggered the night before I ran it). I LOVE running and don't want to give it up, but I am terrified it's affecting my fertility/treatment. I was really worried that my super long cycle in the summer had something to do with my running, but my doc/RE didn't seem to think so. My RE has reassured me multiple times that running is fine as long as I'm not drastically changing anything. But I keep reading conflicting stuff about it. And she even told me that if I did get pregnant, they wouldn't want me to increase my heart rate over 120 bpm, so no running at all. This round of treatment I cut back on my mileage, and I'm considering not running during the TWW. Any advice here?

Last time, they got 15 retrieved, of those 10 fertilized, of those they transferred 3 on Day 3, and of the rest, nothing made it to day 5 to freeze.  We have severe MFI.

It was also weird because my RE had to leave for an emergency appendectomy right before my retrieval, so my last US as well as ER and transfer were all done with a different doc. 

So after getting my neg beta, my RE apologizes up and down that he wasn't there and sounds really surprised when it didn't work. He tells me he's very confident and we really have a strong chance. He says this time we will wait and do a 5-day transfer. My husband had to do a testicle biopsy last time, but they were able to freeze an extra sample, which we will use this time.
  
I know 5-day transfers are more likely to ""stick"" but what scares me is that besides the 3 that were already transferred last time, nothing made it to Day 5! So what if none of these make it?

I can't imagine the devastation of doing all this and having nothing to transfer. I guess if they hadn't transferred the 3 'best' ones on day 3, one of those might have made it to day 5? Anyone ever done a 3-day and then a 5-day for comparison?

I should note here that he has two bio children, so we know there's a possibility of the ""abnormal"" sperm still doing their jobs.

  She said that if everything wasn't normal on my end(which it is), they wouldn't even be looking at morphology much, but since it's so low and I ovulate on meds, it could be our issue.

  We were given the  choice of going on with our planned IUI or skipping straight to IVF(ICSI is included with all cycles at our clinic.)  I asked if we even had a chance at IUI and she couldn't seem to give me a straight answer.  She did say that if we did 2 IUI cycles and didn't get a pregnancy, we should skip straight to IVF.

My SO and I have been trying for one week shy of a year, but were semi trying for 5 months before then. SO lost a testicle to cancer about 6 years ago or so. I had some tests done in Dec because I always thought it was me. Everything came back fine so far so SO reluctantly scheduled a SA. He didn't think he needed to since he had a high count 3 years ago. Well, it came back extremely low and had a very high white blood cell count. The urologist said it may be an infection and put him on a month of antibiotics and told him to take this thing called ConceptionRX but I got him FertilAid for Men because it's pretty much the same thing except way cheaper. The urologist also said IUI could be an option because SO had frozen sperm from before he lost his testicle. He also had his testosterone checked.
His results came back at 174 ng/dl and the standard range is 200-745. So this is extremely low. Which I figured it would be. We asked his urologist what the next step is and they said ""Oh, you have to come in and do another testosterone test right away one morning because we did the test in the afternoon so the results aren't valid"". This made me mad because we had to pay for that invalid test. 

So, SO went in to do another testosterone test and his testosterone came back within the normal range (although still low at 251 ng/dl) but his LH and FSH came back extremely high.
The note on the results from the nurse stated ""Repeat testosterone level within normal limits. Your hormone levels however are markedly abnormal. Your FSH level is 19 indicating that your brain is trying very hard to get the testicles to produce sperm. Unfortunately, your only option for fertility will be in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Your other option for children would be adoption. Let us know if you have any questions."" 

I saw this this morning and it took all of my strength not to start bawling at work. But then I remembered that SO has frozen sperm and the doctor had said IUI could be an option. Then I wanted to punch that nurse in the face because she gave these heartbreaking, life shattering, horrible results without consulting with the doctor first.

I messaged the doctor to ask if IUI with frozen sperm was still an option and if we can still do the SA in 3 months just to make sure. They said yes and yes. But I just found out that the frozen sperm was taken after two rounds of cancer and immediately after radiation treatment so I'm going to guess it may not be the best quality. 

BUT if his low count *is* caused by an infection (he had a very high white blood cell count), couldn't his LH and FSH be high and the sperm not producing because of the infection? This is the hope that I am clinging on to. 

AND I had a CP/Early Miscarriage on Feb 1st after being pregnant for about a week.  if he is infertile, how the eff did I get pregnant in January?

IF you made it this far, I’m so sorry that this is so long!! I am just a mess over here with all of this. Please, if anyone has had any experience with any of these, please feel free to let me know. I feel so alone with all of this as my SO is not the kind to express his feelings.

My hopes in updating this is to maybe show someone that is going through the same situation I was going through that there is some light at the end of that tunnel. We had closed the door on the chance of having children and then it just happened. I waited almost a decade for his sweet little face and it made me appreciate him more than he will ever know. 


Hello all. New to this subreddit and hoping for support from women going through this crappy infertility ordeal. Long story short my husband and I have been married 10 years and have been trying for around 7 years (since I was 21). Basically I just stopped taking any type of BC and we let it be. Fast forward to about 3 years ago we started seeking help from DRs. Husband joined the military so once we had constant health care it was a go to see what we could do. 
I had my HSG procedure yesterday and it was absolutely awful. I was told ahead of time to take some Motrin or similar and to expect cramping. I really feel mislead because the pain was excruciating. As soon as he started injecting the dye the cramping was so bad I started shaking and the nurse came to hold my hand and I  tried to be as still as possible but it was terrible. After the few minutes they were looking over my X-rays and told me that my right tube is blocked and left side is open. I'm so disappointed and heartbroken, I don't know what to think. 
After that I had her get my husband to help me get dressed, I felt so faint and like I was going to puke everywhere I can't believe they didn't do this under anesthesia or at least stronger pain meds.

However, last year in May and in June, I had miscarriages so the doctors won't start me on clomid or any medication until we hit a year without conceiving at all. It's been super frustrating. Every month is a struggle. This last month, I had been charting my ovulation and on day 25 of my cycle, I got a positive OPK. My OPKs have kind of been all over the place but this particular brand has never given me a true positive until this time. So we were intimate that night and the two nights to follow. Along with having sex every other day or sometimes every day before that. And now Mother Nature decided to show right up. They did a sperm analysis on my husband and said his count and motility is completely normal for his age. They've done blood tests, ultrasounds, and an HSG for me and everything has come back normal. 

I honestly feel like the world is trying to tell me that I'm just not meant to have kids. It sounds so pathetic. But I don't understand. I take prenatals. I eat decent. I'm not obese. I follow the instructions of the doctors. And nothing. What's even more annoying is that these two and a half years of bull shit is even without starting fertility meds. I know a lot of you ladies and gents have been through this and beyond. I just don't know what to do anymore. Do we just wait it out until we can start the meds and hope that works? They said my AMH levels were higher than normal so clomid would almost guarantee that I had multiples and that scares the balls off me. I just don't know.

However, last year in May and in June, I had miscarriages so the doctors won&#39;t start me on clomid or any medication until we hit a year without conceiving at all. It&#39;s been super frustrating. Every month is a struggle. This last month, I had been charting my ovulation and on day 25 of my cycle, I got a positive OPK. My OPKs have kind of been all over the place but this particular brand has never given me a true positive until this time. So we were intimate that night and the two nights to follow. Along with having sex every other day or sometimes every day before that. And now Mother Nature decided to show right up. They did a sperm analysis on my husband and said his count and motility is completely normal for his age. They&#39;ve done blood tests, ultrasounds, and an HSG for me and everything has come back normal. </p>

<p>I honestly feel like the world is trying to tell me that I&#39;m just not meant to have kids. It sounds so pathetic. But I don&#39;t understand. I take prenatals. I eat decent. I&#39;m not obese. I follow the instructions of the doctors. And nothing. What&#39;s even more annoying is that these two and a half years of bull shit is even without starting fertility meds. I know a lot of you ladies and gents have been through this and beyond. I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore. Do we just wait it out until we can start the meds and hope that works? They said my AMH levels were higher than normal so clomid would almost guarantee that I had multiples and that scares the balls off me. I just don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Thank you for listening. It&#39;s been a rough road. Even though it feels like it&#39;s never ending and only really beginning. </p>

I have PCOS (lean PCOS - High T, Polycystic ovaries and secondary Amenorrhoea) and bilateral tubal disease.  Because of the tubal damage the risk of a tubal pregnancy is so high that my RE will not give me Clomid or Ferma to induce ovulation.  I also asked about metformin, but my RE didn't want to do it either.  I'm not sure if her resistance was because I wasn't the classic PCOSr, or because of the tubal concerns (i.e. she'd rather me not try to conceive through coital methods). We are still considering IVF, but it will likely be several months before A) Husband is on board and B) We are financially, physically and emotionally ready to move forward.

In the meantime, I am wondering what I should be doing, if anything, to help move my cycle along.  I have had to get Premarin to induce the last 2/3 periods (over 8 months), with the last one actually being natural (with O on CD30). So, do I just wait it out until I hit 45, 60, or 90 days and then get Provera if I haven't had my period yet? or should I be more proactive by temping and if I haven't ovulated by CD 35, go in?

I expected that....but now its sunday night....and im still so bloated (no spotting or cramps thank god!). How long does this last? wasnt expecting to go back to work feeling like this! How long should this go on until i need to see a doc? or really get concerned?</p>

First cycle was long protocol - prostap on day 21, waited for my period then started stimming day 14 with gonal-f, retrieved 7 follicles, 1 transferred but unsuccessful.

2nd cycle was long - prostap on day 21, had my period then stimming from day 7 with menopur, retrieved 7 follicles, 3 fertilised and transferred, positive pregnancy test but miscarried just short of 10 weeks.

3rd cycle was exactly the same as the 2nd but only one follicle was retrieved.  Although it fertilised and was transferred back it didn't implant.

It's been suggested that a flare protocol should produce a better response than last time, so i will be taking noresthisterone for 7-15 days, prostap 5 days later and start gonal-f 2 days after that.

But that's not what I wanted to post about. This journey has been HARD on our marriage.

Over the past eight years, we have very rarely been on the exact same page about the path forward.

About a year ago I finally passed that point where I truly am ok with being child free and it's time to move on (I can say that without tearing up now), but he is adamant that he wants to give it one more go for a biological child with a gestational surrogate - still not on the exact same page.

But through all this struggle, we have remembered that it starts with the two of us, and celebrating the highs, working together through the lows, and learning how to compromise, has made us immeasurably strong together. Ultimately, I am happy with my husband, I feel lucky to have him in my life, and if it ends up being just the two of us, that's all I need.

Over the years I have observed many of the women in my online infertility support groups go through marriage break downs and divorces. It happens in staggering numbers. Why? While there could have been systemic issues in the marriage, I've often felt that it was because they were so focused on the goal of having a child that they forgot that it started with the two of them.

Early on when I was pushing for multiple IVF cycles in a row because I was panicking, he wanted me to take time to let my body recover. It drove me crazy and I was very angry at him. About a year ago I finally passed that point where I truly am ok with being child free and it&#39;s time to move on (I can say that without tearing up now), but he is adamant that he wants to give it one more go for a biological child with a gestational surrogate - still not on the exact same page.</p>

<p>But through all this struggle, we have remembered that it starts with the two of us, and celebrating the highs, working together through the lows, and learning how to compromise, has made us immeasurably strong together. Ultimately, I am happy with my husband, I feel lucky to have him in my life, and if it ends up being just the two of us, that&#39;s all I need.</p>

<p>Over the years I have observed many of the women in my online infertility support groups go through marriage break downs and divorces. It happens in staggering numbers. Why? While there could have been systemic issues in the marriage, I&#39;ve often felt that it was because they were so focused on the goal of having a child that they forgot that it started with the two of them. You need to work on that foundation to have a stable home, through better and worse. </p>

<p>Take care of each other through this journey so you don&#39;t end up at the goal line alone.</p>

I haven't posted anything here since we met with our RE. It's kind of been a whirlwind for me between family and work on top of the consult and initial meeting with the RE.

First things first, I really like her. And more importantly, I feel like I can trust her. The front desk has been very kind and had a real 'it takes a village' atmosphere, which was really welcoming. We already had our blood drawn for the infectious disease panel, as well as a new hormone panel for me - my previous one was August 2014. 

My AFC both visits (two cycles) was 18 and 16 respectively, and our RE is really pleased with that. She told me this afternoon that judging by my blood panel and the AFC results that I would need minimal ovarian stimulation, which is a win. Today my husband did a new SA, since that was from 2014 as well and I did my trial transfer/sonohysterogram. He was allowed to collect at home and bring it in. During our drive to the RE's office we joked about what we would say if he got pulled over for speeding. ""Sorry officer, I was speeding because my sperm is riding shotgun and I need to deliver it in under 1 hour"". I have really struggled to be positive about this situation and experience, so laughing about things can really keep me from being anxious and sad.

 I was worried about the sono and the trial transfer because there was something detected in my HSG in 2014, that they were not sure if it was a polyp or blood clot. The RE said that it must have been a clot that resolved itself, because she didn't see anything and said that there were absolutely no abnormalities. 

Now, it's never fun to get a catheter through your cervix, but this was much more tolerable than the HSG for me. I had no pain at all - besides the pinch of the catheter. I know this varies for everyone, but because there was no balloon on the catheter, and I didn't have to move to get the imaging - it was a much more pleasant experience for me.

All we're waiting for now is for my next cycle to begin and we officially start the process. We've opted to do the 2 ""fresh"" cycles/unlimited FET's option through AttainIVF.

There's a lot of mixed feelings about this process, but mostly I think that I feel ready. I know it's going to be hard, and I have no illusions about how we can do everything right and it can still fail. But having a chance at it at all feels like a blessing after sitting in limbo for almost 2 years. So for now I think I'll say I'm starting to feel cautiously optimistic.

I hope everyone is doing well!

My husband is Korean and honestly believes in the effectiveness of traditional Korean/Chinese Herbal Medicine. We had agreed to try my medicine mix (Royal Jelly, Choline+Inositol, Vitamin D, CoQ10 and a Prenatal) before IVF #3 and if it's another complete failure, go to try the herbal medicine before IVF #4.

Well, my period didn't come AGAIN (I hate you) so I asked my husband about getting acupuncture to maybe get the blood flowing and get back on track. He, of course, took this to mean I was willing to do the medicine early and we had a small disagreement about that. We have a long talk, decided to go to the Herbal Doctor to see what he said, but keep IVF #3 for May.

So we go to the doctor and he does his thing and says, ""Oh your condition is very bad, you will probably need to take this medicine for 5 months."" 5 MONTHS!! I immediately started crying and got into a fight with my husband (in front of my FIL, great...) because I wanted to do IVF #3 in May, I was really looking forward to it and using it as a way to get by day by day and beat depression. He kept saying, ""It's all about your body's health! Your condition is bad, so is mine! IVF #3 won't work if your condition sucks!"" and he was right, but 5 months... Lawd.

The doctor said ""With this medicine, you won't even need IVF again!"" and I find that such bullshit, my husband is missing the sperm casing to penetrate my eggs, THAT SHIT JUST DOESN'T GROW BACK! Luckily he agreed to get another SA after his 3 month regiment is over.

Of course, my FIL and MIL called me to chew me out for the fight, because ""even if it's hard, you have to relax, be patient and always smile!"" No.... I'm human, it doesn't work like that.... but alas.

I started taking the herbal medicine 3 days ago, and let me tell you, IT'S BALLS BAD. Like SO bad. I have to plug my nose for like 5 minutes and take a mint/candy and not burp or the taste doesn't go away. Blah.

Anyway, that's what's up with me. Looking like IVF #3 is going to be sometime in September or October cause I'm 100% sure that the herbs won't work (though my husband is convinced they will... I don't want to burst his bubble.)

So I guess I'm sticking around here for a while.

202,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. I have been following this sub for a while, but this is my first post. I wanted to vent and ask if anyone has been in a similar situation. Sorry this is so long!

My husband and I have been ttc for 16 months now without any success. I was diagnosed with PCOS and there is a polyp in my uterus, which may or may not be a problem. Also, mys husbands sperm had 0% normal morphology. Doctor #1 said this would be a huge problem, but all other doctors since have told us it doesn't have any effect whatsoever on our conceiving. I'm not sure what to think about that.

Anyway, after many months of tests and not knowing what our problem is it was a relief to get the PCOS-diagnosis. Finally we got some sort of an explanation and could start working on the problem. I was prescribed Femar and progesteron, which caused me to ovulate and have a normal cycle. I didn't get pregnant from the first round though, but I wasnt't really expecting it to work out so fast. 

This month (would have been the second Femar-month) I had to stop takin the medicine, because my husbands work-schedule has been crazy (up to 80 hours a week), and I didn't believe that he would find the time and energy to have sex with me when te time would be right. (I was right, he hasn't). And I'm not putting hormons into my body for nothing. This makes me extremely frustrated. Now that we finally have medicine that could help us conceive, we can't use it! Husbands work should become less stressful in abou two months, but I feel like I just can't wait that period of time doing nothing. I'm a mess and we argue a lot.

Last month when I took Femar, my gyn chekced on me and told us to have sex that day (Monday) and Tuesday, because ovulation could happen on either day. We managed to have sex on Monday. On Tuesday my husband came back from work at 9 pm. He didn't feel like sex but knew what day it was and didn't flat out say no. We tried everything. I mean everything we could, but he just couldn't get it up. So no sex, and we propably missed the ovulation.

This has happened before also. And also before his workdays started being so long. He doesn't want to have sex when it's necessary and no matter what I try, he just doesn't perform. I have read a ton about infertility and how it affects on the couples sex-life. Usually the articles focus on the sex being hard on the woman. But I don't find having timed sex difficult. Actually I have enjoyed the increased amount of sex we have been having. Of course it's not always as fun, but it's never disgusting to me. Is this normal? Am I the only woman on earth who can't get his husband to bed even when he knows how important it is? Even when the doctor orders? Seriously?

I feel like I'm doing all the work already. Going to the doctors, taking hormones, tracking the ovulation, cutting down this and that food and drink, takin vitamins, initiating sex at the right time. The only thing he has to do is to have sex with his wife. And he can't even do that. On top of the fact that I feel inadequate when I can't conceive, I also feel undesireable and ugly.

I have been following this sub for a while, but this is my first post. I wanted to vent and ask if anyone has been in a similar situation. Sorry this is so long!</p>

<p>My husband and I have been ttc for 16 months now without any success. I was diagnosed with PCOS and there is a polyp in my uterus, which may or may not be a problem. Also, mys husbands sperm had 0% normal morphology. Doctor #1 said this would be a huge problem, but all other doctors since have told us it doesn&#39;t have any effect whatsoever on our conceiving. I&#39;m not sure what to think about that.</p>

<p>Anyway, after many months of tests and not knowing what our problem is it was a relief to get the PCOS-diagnosis. Finally we got some sort of an explanation and could start working on the problem. I was prescribed Femar and progesteron, which caused me to ovulate and have a normal cycle. I didn&#39;t get pregnant from the first round though, but I wasnt&#39;t really expecting it to work out so fast. </p>

<p>This month (would have been the second Femar-month) I had to stop takin the medicine, because my husbands work-schedule has been crazy (up to 80 hours a week), and I didn&#39;t believe that he would find the time and energy to have sex with me when te time would be right. (I was right, he hasn&#39;t). And I&#39;m not putting hormons into my body for nothing. This makes me extremely frustrated. Now that we finally have medicine that could help us conceive, we can&#39;t use it! Husbands work should become less stressful in abou two months, but I feel like I just can&#39;t wait that period of time doing nothing. I&#39;m a mess and we argue a lot.</p>

<p>Last month when I took Femar, my gyn chekced on me and told us to have sex that day (Monday) and Tuesday, because ovulation could happen on either day. We managed to have sex on Monday. On Tuesday my husband came back from work at 9 pm. He didn&#39;t feel like sex but knew what day it was and didn&#39;t flat out say no. We tried everything. I mean everything we could, but he just couldn&#39;t get it up. So no sex, and we propably missed the ovulation.</p>

<p>This has happened before also. And also before his workdays started being so long. He doesn&#39;t want to have sex when it&#39;s necessary and no matter what I try, he just doesn&#39;t perform. I have read a ton about infertility and how it affects on the couples sex-life. Usually the articles focus on the sex being hard on the woman. But I don&#39;t find having timed sex difficult. Actually I have enjoyed the increased amount of sex we have been having. Of course it&#39;s not always as fun, but it&#39;s never disgusting to me. Is this normal? Am I the only woman on earth who can&#39;t get his husband to bed even when he knows how important it is? Even when the doctor orders? Seriously?</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m doing all the work already. Going to the doctors, taking hormones, tracking the ovulation, cutting down this and that food and drink, takin vitamins, initiating sex at the right time. The only thing he has to do is to have sex with his wife. And he can&#39;t even do that. On top of the fact that I feel inadequate when I can&#39;t conceive, I also feel undesireable and ugly. I know it&#39;s propably the work thing and the baby-making troubles combined and nothing I have done or could do, but still I can&#39;t help how I feel. </p>

<p>Help, has anyone had these kind of troubles and what should I do? Thank you for letting me share, this is not something I could really discuss with anyone.</p>

209,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Background: I had 2 missed miscarriages last year in the span of 3 months, and had an MVA (suction D&C) done with local anesthesia and some pain killers to remove both. It was hard for me to find first-hand information about the MVA, and most information I did find was kind of fear-mongering from people who had gone through a D&C under anesthesia and couldn't comprehend that anyone would do this while awake. I wrote up a [post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/3doxn4/my_mmc_and_experience_with_mva_an_inoffice/) after my first MVA that seemed to help provide some info to others going through it. It was great to have a procedure that didn't carry the risks of general anesthesia and sported a shorter recovery period to boot. 

After going through my second miscarriage back in October, I had another office MVA, but this time she did not remove everything. I had retained placenta which I passed 9 weeks after the MVA. This led to mild infection and after an MRI, my RE saw a band of scar tissue which would need to be removed. (AKA Asherman's, though a seemingly mild case). All this leads me to an in-office hysteroscopy.

Office Hysteroscopy: Again, I was kind of freaked out about doing this procedure while in an office setting, but I also was kind of relieved that I wouldn't have to be placed under general. I had the procedure yesterday and it was honestly kind of awesome. Here's the deal: Night before I inserted 2 tabs of misoprostol to start dilating my cervix. I also took 800mg ibuprofen and a Tylenol w/ codeine. This was the part I was most concerned with, as the contractions I went through passing the retained tissue were pretty horrific and I wasn't eager to go through similar pain. But thankfully, I had very minor cramps and slept mostly straight through the night. The next morning, I took a Valium and 2  Tylenol w/ codeine before heading to the doctor. Once there, they gave me a shot of another anti-inflammatory and another injection of something to prevent muscles from seizing (quite important in this area I imagine). 

My husband sat with me and there were 2 nurses and the doctor (the head of microsurgery at my hospital). She injected lidocaine for the cervical block, which was the only painful part, but only minor. The block was awesome and I literally felt nothing throughout the rest of the procedure. (Side note: I process novocaine and other similar medications slowly so I always request that doctors give me an additional 5 minutes after injection. One doc told me she will starting this with other patients as it makes the dilation easier). 

Then she dilated my cervix and inserted the hysteroscope. There was a big monitor that we both could see. It was kind of awesome. She was in there to remove scar tissue, but surprise! there were polyps too! Within  few seconds she removed the polyps with the micro scissors, and kept searching for scar tissue, which she found and removed. She explained everything I was seeing (including the openings to my fallopian tubes, which were partially blocked by the polyps) and the whole thing was over in less than 10 minutes. It was pretty satisfying to see the polyps and scar tissue get removed and then see a clear uterine cavity afterwards, especially since the polyps could possibly have been causing the miscarriages.

Depending on how much is removed, some people start estrogen therapy (to encourage lining regrowth) or a balloon inserted to prevent scar tissue from reforming. I have migraine with aura and cannot take estrogen because of that. My doctor said this was fine and that many studies show that there is no clinical difference in scar regrowth with balloon or estrogen vs. doing nothing. 

I will be using castor oil packs and continue yoga and acupuncture to increase blood flow, but fingers crossed there will be no scar regrowth. 

After the procedure, I felt a little sore and slow. I took 2 more Tylenol w/ codeine  that day, and have continued ibuprofen today. I have almost no pain, no cramping and feel pretty great.

It was hard for me to find first-hand information about the MVA, and most information I did find was kind of fear-mongering from people who had gone through a D&amp;C under anesthesia and couldn&#39;t comprehend that anyone would do this while awake. I wrote up a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/3doxn4/my_mmc_and_experience_with_mva_an_inoffice/"">post!</a> after my first MVA that seemed to help provide some info to others going through it. It was great to have a procedure that didn&#39;t carry the risks of general anesthesia and sported a shorter recovery period to boot. </p>

<p>After going through my second miscarriage back in October, I had another office MVA, but this time she did not remove everything. I had retained placenta which I passed 9 weeks after the MVA. This led to mild infection and after an MRI, my RE saw a band of scar tissue which would need to be removed. (AKA Asherman&#39;s, though a seemingly mild case). All this leads me to an in-office hysteroscopy.</p>

<p>Office Hysteroscopy: Again, I was kind of freaked out about doing this procedure while in an office setting, but I also was kind of relieved that I wouldn&#39;t have to be placed under general. I had the procedure yesterday and it was honestly kind of awesome. Here&#39;s the deal: Night before I inserted 2 tabs of misoprostol to start dilating my cervix. I also took 800mg ibuprofen and a Tylenol w/ codeine. This was the part I was most concerned with, as the contractions I went through passing the retained tissue were pretty horrific and I wasn&#39;t eager to go through similar pain. But thankfully, I had very minor cramps and slept mostly straight through the night. The next morning, I took a Valium and 2  Tylenol w/ codeine before heading to the doctor. Once there, they gave me a shot of another anti-inflammatory and another injection of something to prevent muscles from seizing (quite important in this area I imagine). </p>

<p>My husband sat with me and there were 2 nurses and the doctor (the head of microsurgery at my hospital). She injected lidocaine for the cervical block, which was the only painful part, but only minor. The block was awesome and I literally felt nothing throughout the rest of the procedure. (Side note: I process novocaine and other similar medications slowly so I always request that doctors give me an additional 5 minutes after injection. One doc told me she will starting this with other patients as it makes the dilation easier). </p>

<p>Then she dilated my cervix and inserted the hysteroscope. There was a big monitor that we both could see. It was kind of awesome. She was in there to remove scar tissue, but surprise! there were polyps too! Within  few seconds she removed the polyps with the micro scissors, and kept searching for scar tissue, which she found and removed. She explained everything I was seeing (including the openings to my fallopian tubes, which were partially blocked by the polyps) and the whole thing was over in less than 10 minutes. It was pretty satisfying to see the polyps and scar tissue get removed and then see a clear uterine cavity afterwards, especially since the polyps could possibly have been causing the miscarriages.</p>

<p>Depending on how much is removed, some people start estrogen therapy (to encourage lining regrowth) or a balloon inserted to prevent scar tissue from reforming. I have migraine with aura and cannot take estrogen because of that. My doctor said this was fine and that many studies show that there is no clinical difference in scar regrowth with balloon or estrogen vs. doing nothing. </p>

<p>I will be using castor oil packs and continue yoga and acupuncture to increase blood flow, but fingers crossed there will be no scar regrowth. </p>

<p>After the procedure, I felt a little sore and slow. I took 2 more Tylenol w/ codeine  that day, and have continued ibuprofen today. I have almost no pain, no cramping and feel pretty great. </p>

<p>I hope this can help anyone out there who will be getting an in-office hysteroscopy! It is kind of cool to be awake for it, and your recovery time is slight. Just make sure they give you enough pain meds and you should be good. </p>

This is my first post ever on Reddit, but I have been a lurker here for a while. We had a meeting with our RE yesterday and decided to start IVF next month. 

Bit of background: I'm 32F, my husband in 34M, and we've been trying for almost 2 years. I had a lap in September 2015, and we tried naturally for a few months after that, but no go. Everything else seems fine on mine and his end. 

I'm tired of blood tests, ultrasounds, appointments and having to be secretive about everything. I'm tired of being invited to baby showers, first birthday parties and everyone else around me talking about their babies/feeding schedules. 

I'm over this already... and I have no idea how I'm going to handle the painful, exhausting, expensive process of IVF. I guess I'm just looking for some support here. Did anyone else feel not at all excited about their first IVF cycle?

I'm starting IVF #1 mid-April so we're starting to get things arranged (we have ER and a TESE in the same day so my mom is coming to help take care of both of us, husband has to not travel for work, etc).

This was a difficult decision, weighing the desire for privacy vs. being tired of hiding so much about my life, which I'm sure you all understand. Ultimately, I am glad I shared this, I feel like a burden has been lifted and I can go to my RE appts without the need to cover up my actions. Everyone has been very, very supportive. 

But I feel uneasy about the excitement level they express. They are genuinely excited about my chances of pregnancy. I am hopeful at times, but after 3 years of infertility and miscarriages, I no longer ""expect"" anything to work.

As of 2 weeks ago my beta was almost-but-not-quite back to zero, like in the 30-40 range. I went in for an appointment today to have one more beta to make sure it was zero (weird hoping for a zero for once), and we decided to do an ultrasound too just to make sure everything there was looking back to normal. My last ultrasound 2 1/2 weeks ago showed no products of conception but thick uterine lining possibly consistent with retained blood clots. After a 2nd dose of cytotec and briefly a little more bleeding, it seems all has been ""normal"" the past 2 weeks. Here's the great news: not only was my beta negative (well it was 3 which I guess is considered basically zero), but my uterus/uterine lining looked perfect and I have a 21mm follicle on my right ovary and an 18mm follicle on my left ovary!

The doc also said we could do IUI if we wanted, with a 10-15% chance of a birth for a cycle.

So now comes the big financial decision.  IUI would be $1600 + meds.  In an ideal world I would like to try one cycle of IUI just to ease into the hormones and see how I tolerate them.  But I don't see spending $3000 (or more? I don't know how much IUI meds cost) just for a trial.

A single IVF cycle with one FET would cost $11,900 + meds + $2000 for PGS on 5 embryos.  Additional FETs are $1850.

We go to Shady Grove and with their ""multi-cycle discount"" we can do two IVF cycles with unlimited FETs (assuming I make any embryos) for $21,500 + meds + $2000 for PGS (or hopefully $4000 if I get more than 5 embryos worth testing from two cycles).  If you get a baby from the first cycle, the program is complete and you forfeit the extra money you paid.  I don't feel like I'm in a ton of danger of this, but a girl can hope.

We're leaning toward the multi-cycle, although I suspect it will end up costing us more.  At my age, even with a decent AFC (15) odds are high we don't get more than a couple embryos at best, and if that's the case I don't know if there's any point in going to a second cycle.

Diagnosis is unexplained, but the doctor thinks I have mild PCOS as well. 

I stimmed very quickly, and triggered after 8 days of 150 units of follistim. I took 10 units lupron with the follistim, and suppressed with birth control pills and lupron 20 units prior to starting stims. 

They got 23 eggs at retrieval. 14 were mature. They attempted ICSI on all of those (we did ICSI in case of fertilization issues). 9 fertilized normally. On day 3, we still had 6 that they called good to very good. One had arrested and two others were highly fragmented. 

On day 5, they said one more had arrested and the other 5 were early blastocysts, they couldn't freeze or biopsy them yet (we were doing PGS also as a security blanket, since we are unexplained and I have never gotten pregnant we wanted to cover everything, and the doctor agreed). 

Today, day 6, they were only able to biopsy and freeze a single embryo, graded BB. She said the other 4 did not progress at all from the day before when they were early blasts. 

To say that I am devastated is an understatement, my doctor thought due to our ages we would have excellent results. 

My husband's SA results have always been excellent. Super sperm, but I know there are things you can't tell from an SA.

What do you all think? What questions should I ask? What additional testing should we ask about? Does this seem like an egg or sperm issue? Can they even tell that?

I'm just so confused, I started to get worried with the high number of immature eggs and lower fertilization rate, but thought we would at least have a few to freeze.

With 4 days of abstinence, his volume was 6.6ml, count was 25M/ml, motility was 45%, with a total motile count of 74.3M. His DNA fragmentation (originally 47.5%) decreased to 33.6, which according to the lab results, still put as in the ""poor fertility potential, IVF/ICSI recommended"" category. I'm not worrying about this last result too much at this point as it's a somewhat controversial test and the research on it could be better (like everything in this shitty IF world.) The clinic did not send me the morphology results, not sure why, I asked the admin but she's away for a few days.

Obviously we're really happy with these results. The count and motility are basically ""normal"". Morphology was always really low (1%), so we'll see what that result is, but I know morphology isn't as concerning to doctors as the other factors. 

Because of these results, and the fact that I am starting a new job tomorrow, we've decided to try naturally until June and re-evaluate at that point. However, I'm very frustrated with our RE, when she called to tell me the results I asked what her recommendation was for next steps and she said ""you can come in for a funded IVF."" I asked if IUI may be more appropriate given the results, and she said, yeah, you could do that. I asked about injectables and she said ""we can decide that when you come in for monitoring.""

I do not want to make that sort of decision on a whim, at a monitoring appointment. That seems odd, right? What if she's not in that day? Another doctor is going to make the plan or I have to come back again the next day? Her tone was SO dismissive, it was clear she wanted to get off the phone as quick as possible. (I also don't want to seem ungrateful that we get one funded IVF, while many people have to pay every time, but we have already paid for one cycle, it didn't go that well, and given my new job, I don't want to do it again unless it's truly the best medical choice for us.)

The other issue is that for the past three cycles, my luteal phase has been nine days. My average is 12, but nine seems really short. This was the original issue I was concerned about last summer, and at that time the RE looked at my progesterone result 7 days post ovulation and said she wasn't concerned at all. For reference, my progesterone was 23.2 nmol/l, which is equivalent to 7.3 ng/ml. 

ANYWAY - do y'all think I should consider switching REs? I could perhaps see someone else at the same clinic. Or is her behaviour par for the course?

On one hand, I totally *totally* understand being in that place where you're still looking for those kinds of answers -- answers that don't come with a price tag of hundreds or thousands of dollars, answers that don't require invasive medical procedures. I was there, I asked those questions (albeit in TFAB or TTC30). 

I'm also aware that some diets actually do help -- some people say keto helped their PCOS and they conceived naturally, and research shows getting yourself into a healthy BMI gives you a fertility boost (statistically speaking). As for supplements, I think we have a group consensus that CoQ10 is at best harmless and may do something for egg quality, and DHEA is cool if your doctor is on board. I think it would be good to have this community wisdom gathered in a central place where we could point new people to, and possibly encourage them to read there, and maybe ask the question in TFAB or search whatworkedforme, before posting here.

I'm asking for this because personally, my husband and I both have legit medical conditions that require $20,000 worth of extreme science in order to have a shot at a baby. This sub has been my home for two years while I deal with that exquisitely painful fact, supported by other men and women who are in the same boat. No herb or diet modification will ever help me, and that is true for the majority of people in this sub. I genuinely enjoy answering questions from new people when I can be helpful, but I don't think we should have to see these posts over and over and be reminded that there is literally no hope that any of these things will ever work for us, especially when there are plenty of other TTC subs where these questions would be normal. 

Also these posts tend to get downvoted, which is probably confusing and hurtful for the OP, who is also likely in a painful place already if they're asking these questions. I don't want to scare away new members because they violated an unwritten rule. I'm not sure what the answer is from a moderation standpoint, or if anyone besides me cares enough to make a rule about these posts. I know for sure it's making me want to stay away from the sub, and damnit, I need this place.

<p>I&#39;m also aware that some diets actually do help -- some people say keto helped their PCOS and they conceived naturally, and research shows getting yourself into a healthy BMI gives you a fertility boost (statistically speaking). As for supplements, I think we have a group consensus that CoQ10 is at best harmless and may do something for egg quality, and DHEA is cool if your doctor is on board. I think it would be good to have this community wisdom gathered in a central place where we could point new people to, and possibly encourage them to read there, and maybe ask the question in TFAB or search whatworkedforme, before posting here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking for this because personally, my husband and I both have legit medical conditions that require $20,000 worth of extreme science in order to have a shot at a baby. This sub has been my home for two years while I deal with that exquisitely painful fact, supported by other men and women who are in the same boat. No herb or diet modification will ever help me, and that is true for the majority of people in this sub. I genuinely enjoy answering questions from new people when I can be helpful, but I don&#39;t think we should have to see these posts over and over and be reminded that there is literally no hope that any of these things will ever work for us, especially when there are plenty of other TTC subs where these questions would be normal. </p>

<p>Also these posts tend to get downvoted, which is probably confusing and hurtful for the OP, who is also likely in a painful place already if they&#39;re asking these questions. I don&#39;t want to scare away new members because they violated an unwritten rule. I&#39;m not sure what the answer is from a moderation standpoint, or if anyone besides me cares enough to make a rule about these posts. I know for sure it&#39;s making me want to stay away from the sub, and damnit, I need this place.</p>
