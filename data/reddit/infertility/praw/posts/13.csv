Three years, four doctors, finally got diagnosed with PCOS, but since I don't have the cysts, she wanted me on spiro which I'm not okay with so I'm trying to get an appointment with another specialist.

Two years ago, I took this new job, moved to a new town, bought a house with a big yard and an ""extra"" room. I was so very convinced it would all finally happen because the timing was just too perfect, right? Good house, stable job, family-friendly town...

The job is a nightmare, we hate this town, and that room is nothing but storage. So now we're trying hard to get out of it all.

Meanwhile, surrounded by the announcements, baby showers, accident babies, and now I have two sisters due with their second babies very soon. 

Still held it together, had bad moments, but working through it all...until a couple months ago. We hired a new staff member who moved with his wife from out of state. In the short time he's been here, it's painfully obvious that he's a much better fit at this place than I ever will be and fun story (although I'm sure you all know where this is going), his wife is expecting. They found out the day they moved here and now she's far enough along that they're announcing it and that's all I hear all day.

Last year was the first time my husband and I were able to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas together in our 8 year relationship (3 years married at the time). Because there were so many firsts for the season, I didn't necessarily wish kids were there, I was just thankful that my husband finally was with me (both military, finally stationed together, it was a good time).

Now that having a baby is pretty much out the window this year, I'm really freaking out about being depressed around the holidays. Christmas is my favorite but it's so damn family based!

* Stress - When I was 12, my father found out that he had leukemia. He died about a year an a half later, and I went to live in a much more demanding / anxiety producing environment. Around the same time that my cycle ceased.

* Marijuana - A few months before I began my period, I picked up smoking pot - every weekend heavily. I've heard of studies proving that marijuana can have an affect on follicles and hormone disruption (especially in males) but not very much research has been conducted on females. I continued smoking more heavily - near daily - for the next few years, but have quit now.

* Diet - I've been told that my metabolic rate is very slow and this, being caused by my diet (not sure how this works exactly? Something about not absorbing b12?) may have stopped my cycle. 

I'm 17 now and have not taken any hormones aside from the progesterone used in testing to see if a cycle could return after a ""fake pregnancy."" I'm currently wondering if it's worth the lifetime decision to get on the pill or use an implant, never before have I taken regular medicine / drugs for anything.

Considering this, is it a *possibility* that my cycle may return? I know you're not doctors, just looking for support or an opinion. Been thinking this over a lot.

<li><p>Diet - I&#39;ve been told that my metabolic rate is very slow and this, being caused by my diet (not sure how this works exactly? Something about not absorbing b12?) may have stopped my cycle. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m 17 now and have not taken any hormones aside from the progesterone used in testing to see if a cycle could return after a &quot;fake pregnancy.&quot; I&#39;m currently wondering if it&#39;s worth the lifetime decision to get on the pill or use an implant, never before have I taken regular medicine / drugs for anything.</p>

<p>Considering this, is it a <em>possibility</em> that my cycle may return? I know you&#39;re not doctors, just looking for support or an opinion. Been thinking this over a lot.</p>

My infertility rollercoaster got stopped about half way up the first lift hill last year when I switched jobs. My new job meant I was finally going to have the money to do more testing and pay the crazy co-pays and co-insurance! And then the bomb shell was dropped on me: my new insurance doesn't cover anything to do with infertility. Matter of fact, they get scream-ish if you mention the words 'having problems trying to get pregnant'. Love my company but I hate my health plan.



So that leads to this month. I'm 30 this year and I've realized I've let another year pass without making any progress on my dream to be a mother. After looking it over, I've decided to pay (out the nose) for an additional, secondary health plan. It's going to be $500 a month but with it's low deductible and infertility coverage, it will save me about $20K between everything I'm sure needs to be done.



My plan is to go with Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC. I want to go with the BlueAdvantage Platinum plan for the low deductible. 



My questions are:



**1)** How does secondary insurance work with infertility? I plan to keep my primary insurance through my employer but that plan does not cover any thing infertility related.


**2)** I'm thinking about Blue Cross and Blue Shield, is there a better insurance company I should looking into for infertility? I live in NC.



Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me out with this huge decision.

I just heard back from the lab that I'm infertile.

The OBGYN said that my sperm count was the lowest she's ever seen (1 million per ML). I always thought a million was a lot, but I guess it isn't.

I don't know what to do, or if there's anything to be done. I don't really have anyone I can talk to about it who knows anything. Even reading over this forum, I can't really decipher a lot of the posts because of jargon and acronyms. Which should give an idea of how new this all is to me.

I've always thought I would have kids but now it seems like that may not be the case. I really have no idea what the implications of this are. All of the information I have is based on a hurried phone conversation between the two of us at work.

My wife appears even more upset than I am and it's hard to not let that make me feel guilty even though I know I shouldn't.

EDIT: Thanks so much for these replies. They are very helpful and reassuring. Even the information that should be discouraging is reassuring, because the worst feeling is just not knowing. Thanks again for the replies.

- I am culturally (though not spiritually) Mormon, so I have some residual issues with regards to the importance of offspring, multiplying, replenishing, being a god, etc. I don't believe in any of that anymore, but there's still some baggage there, you know?

If you've been following along, I've written a little bit about how in the past few months, our TTC was interrupted because of my husband's hospitalizations and illness. Initially, he was treated for diverticulitis. And then again a month after he was discharged. Only the second time, they saw that a mass on his liver had doubled in size- they previously said this was a benign hemangioma. The second time they tried to drain his liver mass, thinking it was another abscess. Followed by another 39 days (total) of IV antibiotics.

Tuesday was his follow-up, ""all-clear"" CT scan. We were hoping to see the ""abscess"" totally gone. That was not the case. The liver ""abscess"" wasn't an abscess at all, and it has again doubled in size- now it's ~8cm (the end of July when they first saw it, it was about 2x2cm.)

They admitted him Tuesday, and have run every test under the sun (probably only except a pregnancy test) and biopsied two lesions that they saw in his rectum and colon, and biopsied the core of the largest hepatic mass.

So now he's being seen at Walter Reed, instead of the community hospital we went to the first two times. They seriously did not mess around. They have multiple specialties on this case. We were able to come home tonight, while we wait for results. It may be Wednesday before we are able to go in and meet with them and see what the specific diagnosis is and what course of treatment/plan we'll be starting. All of the doctors agree right now that it most appears to be stage 4 colon cancer.

My heart is broken. We are so blessed to have two beautiful children. And it's been a long, LONG almost 4 years of trying for a third, and I think whether we like it or not, we're facing the end of our journey. If things look fairly treatable, we may consider trying to freeze some of his sperm before treatment begins, but honestly, it's just not on our list right now of things to think about. 

I'm just kind of.... numb I guess. We have a long weekend ahead of us while we wait, so we're going to try to make some sweet memories with our boys before our world is completely turned upside down. No matter what we're facing, it's going to be big.

I am 37, undiagnosed but it seems to be my issue is craptacular eggs.  We have done three IUIs and four IVFs.  I am fortunate to live in a mandated state but we have maxed out our coverage and at this point are paying out of pocket.  

First cycle--fresh transfer didn't take, one day 5 embryo frozen.  My second IVF cycle resulted in a miscarriage at eight weeks--the dreaded blighted ovum.   Cycle one and two did not have great embryos, so they did a genetic analysis on the miscarried tissue and found it was a genetic abnormality.  Insurance paid for that test, of course.

Fast forward to cycle three--we decide to do two IVF cycles in a row to bank embryos and run PGS testing to determine which are genetically normal to avoid the horrible, soul-crushing experience of prior cycle and miscarriage.  Clinic fees are $2400 to biopsy and $2100 for genetic testing.  Cycle three--total bust.  Nothing makes it to day five.

Cycle four--one embryo at day 5 that can be biopsied, and three stragglers that may grow to be biopsied on day 6.  This is the message I get on my phone from the lab.  I call back and get the embryologist's voicemail, I tell her that I don't know if we want to proceed with the testing since there may only be one embryo.  No call back that day from the lab.

Day 6, of course nothing else makes it to the biopsy stage.  I talk to the embryologist and she mentions they biopsied the day 5 embryo.  I hear it but don't really think about it amidst the disappointment that of two cycles I only produced one embryo.  Husband and I talk later that day, decide since we will be paying out of pocket what is the point of testing this one embryo and one I have frozen from cycle one when could pay the same money to do a FET and put them back in and just see.

I am fortunate to live in a mandated state but we have maxed out our coverage and at this point are paying out of pocket.  </p>

<p>First cycle--fresh transfer didn&#39;t take, one day 5 embryo frozen.  My second IVF cycle resulted in a miscarriage at eight weeks--the dreaded blighted ovum.   Cycle one and two did not have great embryos, so they did a genetic analysis on the miscarried tissue and found it was a genetic abnormality.  Insurance paid for that test, of course.</p>

<p>Fast forward to cycle three--we decide to do two IVF cycles in a row to bank embryos and run PGS testing to determine which are genetically normal to avoid the horrible, soul-crushing experience of prior cycle and miscarriage.  Clinic fees are $2400 to biopsy and $2100 for genetic testing.  Cycle three--total bust.  Nothing makes it to day five.</p>

<p>Cycle four--one embryo at day 5 that can be biopsied, and three stragglers that may grow to be biopsied on day 6.  This is the message I get on my phone from the lab.  I call back and get the embryologist&#39;s voicemail, I tell her that I don&#39;t know if we want to proceed with the testing since there may only be one embryo.  No call back that day from the lab.</p>

<p>Day 6, of course nothing else makes it to the biopsy stage.  I talk to the embryologist and she mentions they biopsied the day 5 embryo.  I hear it but don&#39;t really think about it amidst the disappointment that of two cycles I only produced one embryo.  Husband and I talk later that day, decide since we will be paying out of pocket what is the point of testing this one embryo and one I have frozen from cycle one when could pay the same money to do a FET and put them back in and just see.</p>

They decided that rather than go through that again, they were going to pursue adoption.

They visited our area last spring, and since they’re the only people I know in real life who have dealt with infertility (that I know of anyway), we talked about it a bit, which was really nice for me because, as y’all know, it can feel really really isolating.  

So, about a month ago, they got a baby placed with them for adoption, and while I was obviously jealous about the super-cute baby, there are many reasons adoption isn’t a good option for us, but glad it worked out for them, etc.  

Last weekend they had a brunch so everyone could meet the new baby, and…she announced she’s pregnant.

And I can’t put my finger on why this is bothering me so much.  They’re lovely people and will be excellent parents.  Possibly it’s partly because it gives ammunition to the asshats who think adoption is a magical infertility cure…

But mostly it’s that it’s JUST NOT FAIR.  Why do they get 2 babies at the same time while I get no babies?

They have never really explained to me anything about my embryo grades. I guess I just assumed they would tell me if they were bad. I&#39;m laying in bed comparing all 5 pictures and feeling hopeless. The one picture, our first that miscarried, looks very much like a clump of cells. The other picture of the two from today just look like....blobs. Is it just a bad shot or are they highly fragmented? I&#39;ll probably call them tomorrow and ask for more info. I just don&#39;t want to get my hopes up if these are shitty looking embryos, ya know? Anyone have experience in this? </p>

But it came back showing that I had not ovulated and my E2 is still rising.  Phew.  Now we wait again until tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Last cycle we started with 3 months of birth control, overlapping with Lupron and my body ovulated right through it.  We have been trying to get my to make a nice mature follicle for years and when we try to suppress it, it rebels and pushes through.  Ugh.  My mom wanted me to ask my RE if it could be tied to me having been such a stubborn rebellious child.  Thanks mom (hah... she&#39;s actually great and finds ways to make me laugh through some of this craziness.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s like my body is threatening to ovulate and the meds are saying &quot;Don&#39;t you dare...&quot;.  Please let the drugs win.  </p>

I've been lurking for awhile and feel like I need to share this with people who might understand. I hope this is okay/the right place to share this. My husband and I have been trying for 21 months. We recently came out to our families about our infertility when we were referred to an RE in late July of this year. In mid-late June, DH's brother and his wife (they live out of state) were visiting at my in-laws (we live ten min away from in-laws). SIL, at the time was on some medication that was not safe for TTC and had discussed with me how annoyed she was that she left said medication at home and was trying to get ahold of her doctor so that he could call it in to a local pharmacy. Fast-forward to July when we get the news from my OBGYN that I have PCOS, and she refers me to an out of state RE. I was heartbroken. 

We spend a lot of time with our families and decided to tell them since our time would not be quite as free and for support. We allowed our parents to tell our siblings. Fast-forward again to the beginning of August and we go visit BIL/SIL. We went with the whole family, but stayed in a hotel. They asked in-laws to watch their LO and asked us if they could come to our hotel and hang-out with us. While at the hotel they proceed to complain and talk about how horrible their life is (this is a common thing with them). They live in an extremely small town, BIL's job is in jeopardy, and they are barely making ends meet. they were expressing how they didn't know what they were going to do.

Also, we both have had major issues with the in-laws: Mostly, MIL (controlling, passive aggressive, boundaries). SIL launches into this long rant about how jealous she was about the attention we got from them during to our wedding/engagement and how we were celebrated and accepted and they weren't by the parents (in-laws have three children and DH is oblivious to the competition that goes on with the other two). I was taken aback by this because she was 8 months pregnant at my wedding with their first grandchild and got plenty of attention, and I honestly just didn't even think of it as a competition. The lamenting goes on and on as we sit there and let them vent and talk about themselves for hours as they always do barely acknowledging our infertility and changing the subject back to them when it comes up.

ONE LAST FAST FORWARD

A few weeks ago (September), we miss a facetime from them. I go get DH and call them back. They keep trying to make their almost two year old come into the room. Then BIL with the most smug look on his face says ""LO, Saaaaaaaay BIG SISTER!!!"" Cue punch to my gut. I was in such shock and fear of saying sometime horrible that I acted totally happy for them...for about 30 seconds. Then I just couldn't speak. They went on and on and on about it and told us how excited DH/BILs parents were for them. I slowly edged out of the screen and then locked myself in the bathroom and sobbed hysterically. I know it's crazy to think they did this on purpose....but really....it's feels competitive due to SIL's recent admissions of jealousy and a long list of hasty decisions they have made when they are feeling down. I feel like a piece of crap for being so mad at them...but I'm livid and feel like they were rushing to get pregnant and announce...

oh, did I mention she ANNOUNCED AT FIVE WEEKS? 

Soooo based on my calculations (yes, infertility makes you crazy enough to do that) She got pregnant the first fertile window she had (august) after finding out about us trying/being referred to an RE (late July). It was only after I'd left the room she flatly said to my husband ""I know this can be hard to hear."" and that was the extent of it. In my mind, it looks really bad. She was on TTC unfriendly meds at the end of June, finds out about us TTC at the end of July, tells me how jealous she was of the attention we got during our engagement beginning of August. They get pregnant in August, RUSH to tell everyone in September when she is five weeks, facetime us the news using their two year old and to see our reactions. They BARELY acknowledge the infertility and it's half-assed at that. I feel like either I'm the asshole or they are, and I keep going back and forth between those thoughts. 

My sister is also currently TTC #4, so I guess, selfishly, I'd hoped we'd at least get some excitement from his side of the family if my sister gets pregnant since we are trying for #1. Also, my sister is just not competitive about that stuff. She's been the most supportive person during all of this (besides DH of course). I'm just numb one second, angry the next and then crying.

So on Friday I went in for my transvaginal ultrasound to determine when our IUI will be as well as when to trigger.  I had been on an increased dosage of femara this month, going from 2 pills a day to 3.  Also, this will be our third IUI.

I'm watching the screen while the ultrasound nurse does her thing, measuring follicles and such, and I'm think WOW there are so many!!! So I get pumped because the last 2 IUIs we were working with just one dominant follicle.  After we finish the dr met with me and told me that I had 23 follicles, with 5 large ones.  She went over the risks of higher order multiples and the options I had such as cancel long the cycle, selective termination, timed intercourse, etc.  I want to go ahead with the IUI because my husband and I had already decided to go this route.  So she schedules me for a follow up on Monday (today now) to check on the follicles and insem Tuesday morning.

I get there today, they do the ultrasound.  The nurse comes in saying there's only one dominant follicle and it's only measuring at an 18.  She sends me to the lab to check my levels to see if I had ovulated on my own this weekend.

Later today I get the call back that I definitely have NOT ovulated.  So I'm about to trigger and then insem Wednesday morning.  My question is, maybe the tech missed the good follicles this morning??

I didnt want to be that person who didnt go to baby showers because I couldnt handle other people being happy. I couldnt talk to people with Primary infertility about my problems because they get mad and accuse me of being selfish, and ungrateful. I couldnt talk to people who werent struggling with infertility because I was afraid of making them uncomfortable and stealing their joy. I was tired of being that person who was miserable in the mall during shopping trips because of all the happy glowing pregnant women.

 I was tired of being afraid to talk about my infertility. 

So now I talk openly about it to everyone. I mentioned my miscarriages in passing during a conversation in a group of friends about how we all started hanging out.  I started a new job, and after a few day, opened up and I started talking about my struggles with my co-workers, and turns out, one of my co-workers has infertility struggles as well. I feel so much better, being open and honest and avoiding all the questions about why I dont have more kids, and when will I be having another baby, if my daughter is actually my husbands kid. And I dont seem to be alienating anyone in bringing it up. Most people are genuinely interested in the different procedures, and are surprised to hear that both the men and the women in the relationship have to go through so much just to find out if IVF will actually have a chance at working. 

My only problem now is I am worried I am oversharing. Babies and fertility and relationships all come up, and I have other problems with my health that have to do with my infertility, and it is all related and linked together. Im not giving everyone my entire life history, but in being open about my infertility, I have made people cry, Ive lost friends who dont want to hurt me because they got pregnant... But I am starting to find the sunlight. I dont feel angry anymore, Im not sad on a daily basis, I hold my friends babies and love them like they are my own without feeling as though my heart is falling out my butt.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with male infertility and antidepressants. A few years ago, I began taking a daily antidepressant (Lexapro). My wife and I have been trying to have another child (we have one from pre-Lexapro days), and while we don't seem to have problems conceiving, we have problems getting past the first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy. Things just don't develop right.

With a couple of miscarriages under our belt, we are trying to figure out what may be playing into things.  I have read studies indicating that SSRIs are negatively correlated with semen quality and positively correlated with DNA fragmentation, but it is difficult to discern how significant the apparent effect is, in particular relative to other lifestyle factors (for example, I am thin, I have a good diet, I don't smoke, and so on).  I can't help but wonder whether medication is a factor affecting our pregnancy outcomes this time around.

I'm going to get a semen analysis done in a couple weeks, so we'll see what that says.  If semen quality is poor, I suppose I'll have to make a decision about whether to temporarily go off the medication (something I would not otherwise do, since it works well for me).

Just curious if anyone has any experience or insights to share.  I did not realize until recently that *my* medication might play a role in miscarriage, but that appears to be a possibility.

I come to you again, not to vent about my horribly depressing nurse, but because we're having an appointment with the RE on Tuesday to finalize our decisions, and we're kinda stuck on one of the questions that they're going to ask. 

I know that some of you have considered using or have used adopted embryos, and some of you have chosen to adopt embryos out. Some of you have decided not to. I would really love to hear from those of you who have opted either way, and why. We're wanting to be prepared at this meeting, but we're unsure of how to proceed. 

On one side we want to give this awesome gift to couples who can't have it on their own. 
On the other side, I've got this awful vision of my own flesh and blood wandering around out there, wondering who their ""real"" parents are. I worry that somehow they'll be given to parents who don't connect with them, or who look good on paper, but are really big assholes in reality. 

I wonder what the legalities and technicalities are if we do opt to adopt out, and what if any information those potential people get about us once they come of age. 

I don't have any religious reasons why I should or should not adopt them out, but my whole view on embryos has changed A LOT since suddenly I had 5 sitting in a dish waiting to become real people.

I come to you again, not to vent about my horribly depressing nurse, but because we&#39;re having an appointment with the RE on Tuesday to finalize our decisions, and we&#39;re kinda stuck on one of the questions that they&#39;re going to ask. </p>

<p>I know that some of you have considered using or have used adopted embryos, and some of you have chosen to adopt embryos out. Some of you have decided not to. I would really love to hear from those of you who have opted either way, and why. We&#39;re wanting to be prepared at this meeting, but we&#39;re unsure of how to proceed. </p>

<p>On one side we want to give this awesome gift to couples who can&#39;t have it on their own. 
On the other side, I&#39;ve got this awful vision of my own flesh and blood wandering around out there, wondering who their &quot;real&quot; parents are. I worry that somehow they&#39;ll be given to parents who don&#39;t connect with them, or who look good on paper, but are really big assholes in reality. </p>

<p>I wonder what the legalities and technicalities are if we do opt to adopt out, and what if any information those potential people get about us once they come of age. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any religious reasons why I should or should not adopt them out, but my whole view on embryos has changed A LOT since suddenly I had 5 sitting in a dish waiting to become real people. </p>

<p>Ideally I&#39;d love for you guys to just tell me what to do, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be that easy. :-/ </p>

So, a little background. I am 19. From when I was 11 or so to about 14, I did not mature much physically. Every time I'd get a pimple or something, my mother would tell me ""you must be getting your period soon.""

Anyway, I was started on estrogen and brought up slowly through ""puberty"" until I was 17, and then I was started on birth control to basically just give me the hormones I need and give me fake periods so that my endometrium lining doesn't build too much.

Long story short, I have low AMH 0.998 at age 32. Husband checks out with great swimmers. Saw an RE in July after 15months TTC. He saw a cyst on my right ovary and said we should wait for it to go away before treatment like femara or clomid or IUI. 3 months later it's still there and now there are 2 others. :( RE recommends a laproscopy because he suspects  endometriosis.

<p>Long story short, I have low AMH 0.998 at age 32. Husband checks out with great swimmers. Saw an RE in July after 15months TTC. He saw a cyst on my right ovary and said we should wait for it to go away before treatment like femara or clomid or IUI. 3 months later it&#39;s still there and now there are 2 others. :( RE recommends a laproscopy because he suspects  endometriosis.

121,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone.  Somebody pointed me to this subreddit and I have lurked all day. I usually participate on the Fertility friend forums but I can't take one step without bumping into somebody else's pregnancy announcement and then I feel so bitter. 

My story is that I had a son 9 years ago.  Then I apparently developed a pituitary tumor that produced growth hormone and which remained diagnosed for years while doctors told me that I had unexplained infertility and PCOS (I don't. I didn't.)  Finally, my slight increase in prolactin and annoying attitude got me a referral to the endocrinologist, which revealed a 2 cm tumor.  It was less than ideal to find this out.  Growth hormone causes acromegaly.  Sort of like Andre the Giant, except my tumor was caught early enough that I still look like me, sort of. 

I am now 6 months post surgery, my cycles have returned to semi-normal 25-30 days....but I still can't get pregnant.  I had a chemical pregnancy last month, which failed. Unknown why, except my pituitary is probably still deviated or damaged in some way.  My luteal phase is an underwhelming 9 days (before the surgery it was an impressive 3-4 days).  I found out today my AMH, at 1.5, is too low for my age (I'm 33).  

Given all of the above, my RE told me that her office will now be my pituitary.  I am starting a medicated cycle as soon as my cycle begins anew, which should be in 4 days or so. 2 weeks on BC, then femara, then ovidrel...then seeing what happens.

Somebody pointed me to this subreddit and I have lurked all day. I usually participate on the Fertility friend forums but I can&#39;t take one step without bumping into somebody else&#39;s pregnancy announcement and then I feel so bitter. </p>

<p>My story is that I had a son 9 years ago.  Then I apparently developed a pituitary tumor that produced growth hormone and which remained diagnosed for years while doctors told me that I had unexplained infertility and PCOS (I don&#39;t. I didn&#39;t.)  Finally, my slight increase in prolactin and annoying attitude got me a referral to the endocrinologist, which revealed a 2 cm tumor.  It was less than ideal to find this out.  Growth hormone causes acromegaly.  Sort of like Andre the Giant, except my tumor was caught early enough that I still look like me, sort of. </p>

<p>I am now 6 months post surgery, my cycles have returned to semi-normal 25-30 days....but I still can&#39;t get pregnant.  I had a chemical pregnancy last month, which failed. Unknown why, except my pituitary is probably still deviated or damaged in some way.  My luteal phase is an underwhelming 9 days (before the surgery it was an impressive 3-4 days).  I found out today my AMH, at 1.5, is too low for my age (I&#39;m 33).  </p>

<p>Given all of the above, my RE told me that her office will now be my pituitary.  I am starting a medicated cycle as soon as my cycle begins anew, which should be in 4 days or so. 2 weeks on BC, then femara, then ovidrel...then seeing what happens. I am pretty nervous about having a medicated cycle given my pretty sucky year overall, and I have no idea what to expect.</p>

<p>So sorry for the tl;dr and rambling.  I would love any tips on Femara/ovidrel effects.</p>

I'm moving my flag here from TFAB because we've been referred to an RE and my chart officially reads ""female - infertility"". I posted this before but it was removed (I made some allusions to the other trying for a baby sub?), so I'm trying to post again.

Our story: I'm 28, my husband is 33, and we are coming up on our second wedding anniversary in November. I work as a medical assistant in a NICU and he is an Active Duty Army officer. We have two dogs and I like to crochet little hats for the NICU babies in my free time. Working on pumpkin ones right now for Halloween.

I went off my birth control pills after ten years of use in March. Had a 90 day cycle, went to the doc and was diagnosed with PCOS and annovulation. Spent the summer doing baseline bloodwork, rebooting cycles with Provera, and taking increasing doses of Metformin with no results. Upon getting back CD 21 bloodwork with a progesterone level of 0.8, my PCM is sending us to the infertility clinic. He's ordered a semen analysis and HSG, and if we are still waiting for an appointment with the RE after all those results are back, he can do one round of Clomid with us.

I feel very lost, broken, sad, and alone right now. I know few people at our current duty station and ""hey I found out I have fertility problems"" doesn't make for a good text to friends several time zones away. So I don't talk about it much. Some friends know we are trying, but they're all ""it will happen when it happens!"" I know my husband very much does not want to do the semen analysis - he wants having children to be a ""fun surprise"" that we get one day after having lots of sex. I suppose that's our first hurdle to cross.

The second is that we are scheduled to move in mid-February, and will only be there for six months, so depending on how long the wait is for the RE we could be looking at quite a while before we can get going on any sort of plan.

I know these are common feelings and is probably a pretty common story around these parts. I take some comfort from that.

145,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone. I can't believe I'm here. I'm sure that's a common sentiment. This is so long, I'm sorry, but there's a TL;DR at the end.

We got pregnant on our second try in July. That ended in miscarriage.

I bled for weeks after the MC. Ultrasound and MRI were inconclusive as to whether I had an intracavitary fibroid, or just retained products of conception. I was scheduled for a hysteroscopic procedure (either D&C or myomectomy) to have whatever-it-was out in August.

They found secret option C: a mass that wasn't a fibroid. They removed a bunch of it, and the pathology came back as low-grade endometrial stromal tumor. It is usually malignant, but the tumor needs to be cut out with healthy tissue in order to know for sure.

My oncologist agreed to try still-experimental fertility-preserving treatment. This involved taking out the remaining tumor along with the piece of uterus it's attached to and a small margin around the whole thing, then reconstructing my uterus. Even with a malignant tumor, this should allow me one or two pregnancies, with constant monitoring and eventual hysterectomy.

Two weeks ago they resected the tumor. Pathology came back as malignant low-grade endometrial sarcoma. I was prepared for that. Worse, the margin was positive, meaning there are probably still tumor cells in my uterus. A repeat resection is useless: the remaining tumor is microscopic, and even if they knew what tissue to take out, it would likely leave my uterus unable to carry another pregnancy.

So I'm having a hysterectomy as soon as 1) I recover sufficiently; and 2) I have one round of IVF to freeze some embryos. I won't lose my ovaries in this procedure, but the risk of damage is enough that we want to try to get some embryos before the hysterectomy. That puts us in early to mid November.

I met with the RE, and we have a timeline for egg retrieval in four weeks. The protocol will be modified to accommodate the hormonal responsiveness of my cancer. It's our last hope, but I'm not getting too excited.

There is just so much.

I entertained wild schemes of getting pregnant anyway and giving the finger to the massively increased risk to my own life. My husband doesn't want that. I would do anything for him, I would die for him, but he wants more: he wants me to live. So I am committed to a hysterectomy...but they'll still have to strap me down and sedate me when the surgery comes around.

A gestational surrogate is our only hope for having biological children. We definitely can't afford one yet.

I can't be hopeful anymore until I have an actual baby in my arms. At every appointment, we have been hopeful, made a plan, only to crash and burn. Not only do our plans not work, the result is *worse than we ever imagined*.

At this rate, we'll get zero embryos out of my 20 potential follicles. Or our eventual gestational carrier AND our baby will die in childbirth. Or I'll be the only person in history to die of my cancer within a year of my diagnosis. The one, one, one thing we have going for us is that the cancer is very non-lethal after hysterectomy.

I ask Debbie to ask the RE things and she says she does and the answer is always 'no'.  So then I email the RE and his answer is always 'sure'.  

I requested a TSH check because I was switched from levo to synthroid (the name brand equivalent) and was told by Debbie I didn't need to do one because it was the same medication but she got the order for me anyway.  I got it drawn last Friday.  I call on Tuesday- she says it isn't in and that I don't need to call her, she will call me when it is in.  Come Friday, I still haven't heard, so I call.

I mention it more than doubled to 2.6 and she's like 'oh...well it's still normal'.  I ask her to run that by the RE because I've only been on this change for 4 weeks, the TSH could be on its way up to outside of normal.  She says she will but RE likes it around 2.  *It's around 2 now but the transfer is in two weeks and might be around a 3 or 4 by then, DEBBIE!*  She calls me back, RE says TSH is fine, don't change.

I email my RE.  He agrees the TSH jump is concerning and wants me back on levo.  He then mentions he has been out of the office due to kidney stones.  My question is, did Debbie even run it by him?

No. Would a hysteroscopy be a good idea?  No.  Can I have migraine meds called in?  No.  RE: yes, yes, yes.

Ultrasound tech doesn't turn the monitor where I can see, doesn't say a word about what she sees and when I ask ""So, any cysts?"" she's all ""The doctor will tell you."" Girl, by now I can read that thing better than you can.

Talk to my RE. AFC is 5-6. Plan is clomid if my FSH isn't stupid-high. RE emails me a few hours later ""Hey, I think you have a functional cyst, FSH 22 and E2 is 665.""

For those of you new to my special snowflake ovaries, the last time I had a 'cyst' on Day 3, I insisted on trying to see if there was an egg in there, and so I triggered that day, and on Day 5, boom, egg. Slightly immature but it matured in the lab and fertilized.

Me: What size is it? 

RE: 2.1.  Do you want to trigger see if there's anything to retrieve like we did last time?

Me: Yes. Set it up and I'm on my way.

I decide to walk to the clinic because I've been sitting on my fluffy ass too much, and while I'm en route, RE calls. Apparently my LH is really high. The thing is, they can't tell if it's a surge or not because apparently my LH is varies cycle to cycle and is frequently high (which is what happened the time I ovulated through the ganerilex, they saw the LH was high but assumed it was just me being high LH. Not so.) 

So it's possible that if we trigger today and retrieve Sunday, we will be retrieving too late, because who knows when the surge started? ""What if we retrieve tomorrow?"" Still might be too late, but also it might be too early and the egg is immature.  

RE: What do you want to do?

Me: Uhh....  I'm walking over. Let me think while I walk and if you have a second between patients let's talk when I get there.

(RE's recommendation was ""I don't live your reality, but I would recommend skipping this cycle."" No. I do not have normal cycles to wait for.)

So I get there with the idea of hey, what if I took the trigger shot right now (like, 2 in the afternoon) to give little whoever in there the best possible shot of maturing and then we retrieve tomorrow if there is anything to retrieve?

RE: It's unconventional, but we can try it. But you know, it may already be too late, and it may not work, so as long as you can emotionally handle the worst case scenario....

Me: What worst case scenario haven't I been through already?

So I triggered right then and there and egg retrieval is tomorrow. On Day 4. We have to freeze, because it's motherfucking CD3 and I am still bleeding last cycle's lining away.

My nurse (who actually administered the trigger since I was there) was like ""Your RE came to me and said 'Don't judge me, but I have a strange situation with a patient.' and I was like 'Oh, I bet I know who it is.'""

160,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So as some of you know, I've been on a crazy quest to find a new dentist and get a metric shit-ton of dental work done prior to my transfer in November.  The good news?  After a terrible experience with one dentist, I found another whom I really like overall.  Let's call her New Dentist.  I'm also impressed with one of the other dentists in her office (he did my first round of fillings yesterday).  Let's call him New Dentist #2.  New Dentist is nice and most importantly, knows what she's doing and is extremely thorough.  She also isn't the type to talk you in to dental work you don't need (unlike the first place I visited).

The bad news?  New Dentist has verbal diarrhea of the mouth, possibly the worst I've ever had to experience.  Apparently her sister or SiL is a retired RE, so New Dentist thinks she knows everything about IVF.  These are a few of the things she said to me on Tuesday after finding out we did IVF and are doing a FET in November:

-""What are you going to do if none of them stick?  I know a couple who had to do 5 IVFs and the last round, they transferred 5 embryos and only one of them stuck; she had to get her cervix sewed shut to keep the embryo in!!!!"" (awesome, thanks for bringing up what I'm already obsessively worrying about)

-""Ah, you've never been pregnant?  Have you thought about a surrogate?"" (Um yeah, except we don't have the spare $100k to pay for one, but thanks for asking)

-""Are you going to transfer more than one?  Don't they ALWAYS transfer more than one?  What are you going to do if you have twins?  You'll have you quit your job if you have twins, there's just no way you can work with twins."" (Yeah, I can't really afford to quit my job, but thanks for the concern, I guess?)

-""Pregnancy makes your skin awful, your hair fall out, and your teeth deteriorate.  Maybe all of those won't happen to you, but trust me, at least two of those will."" (I'm already worried enough about my hair due to the PCOS; did NOT need to hear this!!!!)  

-""What are you going to do with the leftover embryos?  They're babies, you know that, right?  They may just be a clump of cells but they're still your babies."" (Yup, already worried about this, too, thanks for asking)

-(after being told that embryo adoption is an option):  ""Well yeah, but then someone else would be parenting YOUR babies."" (Yup, already thought about this, didn't need to be reminded of that angle)

-""I don't really understand donor eggs.  Why not just adopt?""  (I'm not even doing donor eggs, and don't worry guys, I educated her on adoption and why ppl opt for donor eggs).

So at this point I'm sure you all are wondering why I didn't say a few choice words and walk away from New Dentist, never to return.  Trust me, I've thought about it.  But she really did seem to mean well....it's hard to explain.  She's just one of those ppl that doesn't know when to STFU. Plus, although she clearly knows fuck-all about IVF, she does know her shit about dentistry. Also at this late in the game, I really don't have time to try and find yet another dentist before my FET.  My dental insurance has a pretty narrow network and New Dentist's office is one of the only ones that is a ""preferred provider"" in my town.

My plan going forward is to instead try to see New Dentist #2 exclusively; I saw him yesterday and he came across as extremely competent, gentle, and most importantly, didn't say ignorant shit about IVF.  In fact, he didn't mention it at all; instead, he was fully focused on my comfort and care and I had probably the best dental experience I've ever had.

I warned my hubby I would be here a lot this morning. 

I'll update this all day as I have more thoughts. 

A great start since my parents brought a cheque* with them when they arrived to pick me up. Then a shit delay because my husband didn't bring his wallet and needs his health card. We've pulled a u turn and we're going to be late. This is not like him so I'm really pissed. 

We don't have a car. I drive but my husband doesn't and I can't drive myself today anyway. Perks of having moved back to my home city last year. 

* After I started crying, I found out the cheque, an almost perfect amount to cover last year's IVF+meds (but not FETs), has nothing to do with this. It's to offset the fact that I can't join my dad and brother climbing Mt Kilimanjaro next week. Mom can't make it fair that I can't go, but she can make the finances of ""paying my brothers way and me not costing anything"" fair. It's just a coincidence that it will pay for this. I felt less beholden after that. Phew. 

Checked in:

Feeling woozy from the lorazepam already. Here comes the damn hand IV. Ugh. Mr mL is off doing his part. I hope he's ok because usually he makes a big joke about racing others but he's not back yet.

Here he is and my IV is in and my arm is freezing and the nurse just pulled on the tube to move my arm. Ugh. 

~~~~~~~~

Update from Dr. mL (I'd been demoting him to not cause confusion with the medical doc's);

Procedure went well, she is crying happy tears and going to take a power nap 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So I'm more conscious now. That retrieval went so much easier. I don't know which of all the confounding factors helped : more fentanyl, the music, just knowing that to expect. But there was no panic. 

Egg haul: 9. Tears are no longer happy. I have to stop trying to interpret my chart  since I was really sure we were getting 18. Based on last time's chart and outcome. 
 That was just a blow of ""fucking  amateur counting eggs before they're retrieved.""

But then in response to my upset the nurse said, ""what, did you want 9 kids"" and I immediately threw back ""that's not how that works. Grow out here is about 40%"" But I hate trying to reason with them in the recovery room; they all look at me like they want to pat me on my head and say ""don't think so much"". (Oh and they did say that.) 

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being driven home now. I've had nothing to eat because I don""t want to but very little to drink on nurses orders which are annoying me because cold water or hot tea should settle my stomach. She said I should at least wait until after the drive. I have two different kinds of throw up bags.  

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Haven't ralphed yet. Mom and hubby ran into Costco for me for a couple things (it's right on the way home so I insisted). I grilled my dad about his prep for Kilimanjaro - did they have all the embassy number, the rescue helicopter on speed dial, was the guide trained to tell if dad (or my brother) had to stop. It sounds like they are totally prepared -- the guides have 02 sat monitors to make sure the altitude isn't getting to them. 

I'm set up on the couch with everything I could need and the intercom to bring Mr. mL down if necessary. But right now, nap time.

I've been lurking for a bit- reading your stories was a first step for me but I'm struggling.

Husband and I are about to start month 23 of trying naturally to conceive. We've been told we'll likely need IVF with ICSI due to male factor infertility but since we're early 30s and all seems fine on my end we've held off on IVF. I guess a bit of denial too...

When I look back over the last 6-8 months since we got the news, I'm realizing how much I've ""checked out"". I haven't been to the gym, something I used to enjoy, I find myself at parties unable to think of anything to say (I usually never shut up), not having plans at all, or avoiding things where there will be kids and people with hopeful faces looking at my stomach...and while work is going great by all accounts, I'm not motivated to plan ahead because it gets my mind spinning about the ""best time"" to start IVF etc. so even that is starting to suffer.

Tonight I can't sleep and I feel like putting my foot down... At least I need to get active-right? Anyone else feeling this way? Or did you get out of it?

I've been gone from these boards for a while but could use your help again. 

We have been pursuing surrogacy for a while. We made it to the contract stage with once candidate who decided they couldn't agree to our terms and dropped out and another that changed their minds before we even reached the contract stage.

The next people we have been presented with look like wonderful people and have some emotional maturity that our other candidate couples have lacked. 

The issue is the potential surrogate's physical profile. She had two miscarriages before she carried her child to term. The doctors suspected a progesterone deficiency, and she was on progesterone for her third pregnancy and everything went fine, but they never did any tests to even confirm that was the problem with the other miscarriages.

We have three embryos. And that's it. And surrogacy is expensive. So obviously we'd like to maximize our chances.

Am I being stupid by being concerned about those two miscarriages? The doctors seem to think ""oh yeah, everything should be fine"" but these are the same doctors that told me they would have no problem getting me pregnant.

I have to decide in the next couple days if I want to move forward with IVF this cycle or wait.  We've prepared ourselves as much as we could for this moment, but we were always hoping this 4th IUI would work.

One second I want to do this right now and the next I want 6 more months to prepare.

At any rate, a huge part of my consideration is my job.  I am on a career trajectory I do not want to derail.  My husband will be staying home with our baby.  

So I am curious to know how you felt during the IVF process.  Since I don't know what protocol I will be on, the RE really can't tell me how many appointments there will be.   I am curious how you felt during the process.  

Were you sick and did you need time off?  Did the hormones make you crazy so you really couldn't focus?  Were you able to hide this from your coworkers?  

I have a feeling that I am being foolish to think that there is ever a convenient time for this and that it is ridiculous to try and plan this around work schedules.

I highly recommend Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In.  It changed my professional life tremendously and also gave me the courage to move forward with trying to start a family while working on my career.  The chapter specifically about having kids was very inspiring to me.

Some information about me: 23F, my husband is 23M. Found out a month before my wedding that I have Endometriosis, diagnosed via laparoscopy. I believe the disease is on the moderate-to-severe side, but it's hard to say as my doctor didn't go into detail too much besides that ""it looked like textbook Endometriosis in there"". From what I understand, she ""burned off"" most of it, and drained the two rather large chocolate cysts I had. We did the fallopian tube dye test as well, and my tubes are clear. This was in May of this year.

Started trying for a family right away in June. It is now (almost) October, and the 5th unsuccessful cycle is over tomorrow. Doctor said in June to come see her in 6 months if I'm not pregnant, and then we'd probably start Clomid. 

I am nervous that this journey to have a child could take longer than expected. And with each period I have, the Endo gets worse. Eventually it could scar my tubes and etc. I'd like to talk to my husband about ""where we stop"" on our quest to have a child, but I am afraid I'm not exactly sure what the path IS.

My knowledge to this point:

- try naturally for 6 months

- Clomid

- ???

- IVF

Additional question: should I be trying to look for an RE? I will be looking for a new OBGYN in any case, just because I am going to switch to my husband's clinic once the insurance for my new job kicks in, in November. I am worried that a new OBGYN/RE won't want to follow the same plan that I've already discussed with my current doctor.

Additional, additional question: I really wanted my husband to get an SA (pre-emptively) last month, but he seemed really gun-shy about it. So I agreed to back off and worry about it more once we get to Christmastime, if I'm not pregnant. He's on the overweight side, so I think that can impact sperm-related things. When did you have to do an SA? Any tips about how to approach this whole topic?

I understand everyone's situation is different, so there is a different path/different treatments for everyone. I'd like to hear about YOUR path, as well as an insight into what I may be facing in the future.

Thank you kindly.

I decided to get some dental work done prior to my upcoming transfer in November.  I haven't been to a dentist in a while so I expected a lot of fillings, but I guess I need to either get a root canal or an extraction of my right last upper molar.  I am leaning towards an extraction simply because I'm worried about the root canal causing more problems down the road, especially during a pregnancy.  I've also read that a root canal can never get completely rid of the infection so an extraction is best.  I don't really want to shell out the money later though for a dental implant.  My RE told me that dental work is fine before a transfer but I still worry.  I'm not in a lot of pain right now, although I know that can change in an instant with tooth problems.

Has anyone been through this scenario?  What did you choose?  I feel like losing the very backmost molar shouldn't be that big of a deal, but supposedly it puts me at risk for tooth movement and eruption of the bottom tooth opposite the one removed.

Also, if anyone has any recommendations for a dentist in the South King County/North Pierce County suburbia region of WA State, I'm all ears. I'm not super happy with how I've been treated by my current dentist and would like to get a second opinion on my situation.

I lay down! On the hip opposite of the injection side and prop my head on that hand for visibility purposes. I then let the top leg (injection side) lay in the bed behind me. Sort of crossing my legs at the knees. I then use the dart approach to getting the needle in and I am careful to make sure the finger grip things on the syringe are going to the same direction as my body so I can easily switch my grip to put my thumb under the finger grip and use my index finger to push down the plunger. Works really well for me!

How I found this position: I have always layed down but to find the best top/injection leg position I put two finger on my glute muscle and sort of swung my top/injection leg back and forth slowly until my glute was the softest and least tense. I found it was laying slightly behind me. Also, I find my nerves are less wrecked when I'm laying. Standing makes me feel unbalance even if I'm holding on to something or leaning on a wall.
