12,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello friends!

I joined about a week ago (and LOVE this group). I posted [""A letter to my fertile friends""](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3qzoh9/a_letter_to_my_fertile_friends/) but then decided I should change my username to something less nonsensical before I got too deep. 

I'm about to start my second round of IVF. I started my first round in January, got three embryos, got pregnant on the third, and had a miscarriage in July. I finally got approval from insurance on Friday, and today is my last day on the pill. I thought I would be excited, but instead I'm mainly feeling anxious. In yoga on Friday, I thought, ""What if this is just another string of failures?"" and started crying. I have reason to be optimistic; I have no medical issues that we know of, and the only reason we started IUI in the first place was because my husband is a cancer survivor and we had to use frozen sperm. But we've had reason to be optimistic all along, and that hasn't gotten us anywhere. 

So that's a little context for the following two dilemmas. First, a friend of mine just had her second child. She's been a close friend in the past (she was my only bridesmaid besides my sister) but we have grown apart in recent years. After my miscarriage, my husband texted her husband that we would contact them when we were ready. I met her for lunch once and we've texted but haven't gotten together other than that. 

We texted a couple weeks ago about seeing them and meeting the baby, but it didn't end up working out and I was relieved. I don't even know how to act. This is the first time a close friend has had a SECOND baby. I feel like I'll be playing a role, partly because I'm always playing something of a ""false cheer"" role with other people's babies, but also because I already feel like we're pretending to still be close friends. Neither of us has texted since then, and I'm wondering if I should take the initiative and reach out. 

Second, another close friend is getting married in Sri Lanka in January. We live in the U.S., so it would be a VERY long trip. (She's Indian, so it is a destination wedding, but it's not an insane location choice.) My husband doesn't want to go if we're pregnant. On the one hand, I know he's paranoid ... he'd prefer me to just lie on the couch from the day of the transfer to the day I go into labor. On the other hand, I think he has a point. It will be a long flight, and we'd have to worry about the food and water once we're there. So I emailed my friend that we'd just have to wait until December and make a plan at the last minute. I haven't heard back from her in a couple weeks and have no idea how she's reacted. She knows about our situation and her husband is also a cancer survivor, so I assume she'll be supportive but I don't know.

<p>I&#39;m about to start my second round of IVF. I started my first round in January, got three embryos, got pregnant on the third, and had a miscarriage in July. I finally got approval from insurance on Friday, and today is my last day on the pill. I thought I would be excited, but instead I&#39;m mainly feeling anxious. In yoga on Friday, I thought, &quot;What if this is just another string of failures?&quot; and started crying. I have reason to be optimistic; I have no medical issues that we know of, and the only reason we started IUI in the first place was because my husband is a cancer survivor and we had to use frozen sperm. But we&#39;ve had reason to be optimistic all along, and that hasn&#39;t gotten us anywhere. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s a little context for the following two dilemmas. First, a friend of mine just had her second child. She&#39;s been a close friend in the past (she was my only bridesmaid besides my sister) but we have grown apart in recent years. After my miscarriage, my husband texted her husband that we would contact them when we were ready. I met her for lunch once and we&#39;ve texted but haven&#39;t gotten together other than that. </p>

<p>We texted a couple weeks ago about seeing them and meeting the baby, but it didn&#39;t end up working out and I was relieved. I don&#39;t even know how to act. This is the first time a close friend has had a SECOND baby. I feel like I&#39;ll be playing a role, partly because I&#39;m always playing something of a &quot;false cheer&quot; role with other people&#39;s babies, but also because I already feel like we&#39;re pretending to still be close friends. Neither of us has texted since then, and I&#39;m wondering if I should take the initiative and reach out. </p>

<p>Second, another close friend is getting married in Sri Lanka in January. We live in the U.S., so it would be a VERY long trip. (She&#39;s Indian, so it is a destination wedding, but it&#39;s not an insane location choice.) My husband doesn&#39;t want to go if we&#39;re pregnant. On the one hand, I know he&#39;s paranoid ... he&#39;d prefer me to just lie on the couch from the day of the transfer to the day I go into labor. On the other hand, I think he has a point. It will be a long flight, and we&#39;d have to worry about the food and water once we&#39;re there. So I emailed my friend that we&#39;d just have to wait until December and make a plan at the last minute. I haven&#39;t heard back from her in a couple weeks and have no idea how she&#39;s reacted. She knows about our situation and her husband is also a cancer survivor, so I assume she&#39;ll be supportive but I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Any thoughts/guidance/advice?</p>

Hi all,

I just got home from the initial baby-planning appt with my gyno and I'm very hopeful. My partner who has been a bit timid about the whole process loved my doc and said she felt really comfortable and confident having her guide us through this. My gyno is also a partnered lesbian who has kids so she was extremely enthusiastic about it and it was reassuring to hear her perspective as someone who has been through the process in a same-sex relationship. I am so lucky to have her! 

In terms of my chances of conceiving as well as complicating factors such as my MS and irregular periods she reassured me that overall, I have a good chance for a baby. She is recommending that I look into IUI because it is much more effective with frozen sperm and that I may go on Femara(?) or Clomid to assist with ovulation. Whenever we are ready she can refer us to a fertility doc. 

I had questions about the fertility meds causing multiple sclerosis relapses but the GnRH agonists which seem to be responsible for the relapse increase would not be used unless I moved on to other ART like IVF. Because of the extremely high relapse risk I am pretty sure I won't do that. So, if anyone here is reading and also has MS, avoid the GnRH agonist medications if possible. She also said that I would be followed by a high risk OB because of my MS if I did get pregnant, but we'll cross that bridge as it comes. MS makes everything harder!

I feel overwhelmed and we are not sure when we will get started with all of this but it is a big relief to hear that my gyno thinks I will do OK with minimal intervention, given the specific risks involved with the meds for me.

All doctors have told me to not worry. I did have 2 small polyps removed when I started my infertility treatments. But, the spotting continued even with them removed. For one IUI cycle I was on Crinone and it did stop the spotting. But, my doctor has not said I have low progesterone levels as all tests look fine.

I'm now pretty convinced this spotting is doing something to cause my infertility. It's frustrating doctors don't seem concerned about it. I'm doing my first IVF this cycle and hope it won't fail because of this spotting. My worry is it has to do with implantation.

I&#39;ve had a persistent, though not excessively painful, stomach cramp the last several days, more cervical mucus than usual at this point in my cycle (I&#39;m currently on CD 20), and the kind of uterus-area cramps that feel like I&#39;m about to get my period, even though that&#39;s insanely unlikely this early. Is this all just my body adjusting to Synthroid?</p>

During my surgery tomorrow, there will be several people in the room while my business is spread wide open. I know I'll be unconscious but it's still mortifying to think about how many people will have a clear view of my genitals while I'm knocked out. 

Does this problem bother anyone else? Or have you pretty much abandoned all modesty?

UPDATE: We just left the surgery center. I was called back at 8:45, they had me change and put on a cap over my hair. They put in an iv, put these things on my legs to prevent blood clots, made me remove my piercing. I was allowed to see my mom and sister one more time, then they wheeled me into the operating room. The anesthesiologist put an oxygen mask on me, told me to take a few deep breaths, and lights out. I don't remember seeing my doctor, or any part of the procedure. I don't remember putting my legs up in stirrups, or anything. Just the oxygen mask, then complete darkness. A few seconds later, I felt something squeeze my legs, and I woke up in recovery.

I've been temping/using OPKs for 9 cycles and FertilityFriend has always pinpointed ovulation the day after I get my peak reading (usually around CD22-25).  

This cycle I took 5mg of letrozole from CD 3-7 and surged on my own on CD14. My follicle scan that day showed multiple mature (well mature-ish, largest 16mm) follicles and I also had moderate cramping on CD16&17, the day after I supposedly ovulated, something I've never felt before.  

However, I never got a temp rise. [My chart clearly shows no change.](http://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/5765a2) I went in for what was supposed to be 7dpo bloodwork today and my progesterone was 1.25.   

I've read about a lot of people for whom letrozole doesn't induce ovulation, but why would I *stop* ovulating on letrozole?! I guess I'm CD22 today and could technically still ovulate in a few days?   

Now it's waiting for CD1 to see if any of those follicles turned into cysts (I'm wondering what all that cramping was about - any experience with that??) and next cycle we'll be doing a trigger shot once my follicles get to 20mm.

The follow-up from that appointment made it sound like everything else was working just fine, and maybe the endo was the thing causing problems with the IUIs...so of course they decided to increase my dosage of Femara to 7.5 mg and throw in Follistim too. I proceeded to completely lose my mind for a week (there was an incident with a Windows 10 commercial...it was not good). Day 11 ultrasound unveiled four big-ass follicles. I agonized and pored over clinical studies but ultimately decided to cancel the cycle. 

Fast forward to today's start of cycle consultation, and they recommended keeping me on both Femara and Follistim but dialing back the dosages of both. I wasn't really thrilled with that and said so -- from the literature they gave me (and my own research), it seemed clear that the risk of multiples came from Follistim, and that may not be necessary. Why risk it again? My consulting physician stopped, pulled out a piece of scratch paper, and meticulously went through my file and mapped out exactly what my last six cycles have looked like. I was so relieved that she took the time to do this -- I've felt more often than not like I'm being treated as the statistical norm, when my body keeps swerving. After looking at the progress map, she agreed that it might not make sense to do the Follistim and presented a compromise: I do the course of Femara and go in on Monday for an ultrasound to see how it went, and then we decide about Follistim based on that.

It's started in 2011, I was the maid of honor in a very close family members wedding and when asked when they would start having kids she exclaimed, ""immediately!"" I was excited for her. She lives in one state and I live in another (this will be important to know later)My husband and I decided a month later we would try to have kids. Flash forward to Jan or Feb of this year. 

We both have been battling infertility all of these years and have vented over every baby announcement in our family (there were several) and we're both on each others side. I just moved to another state so I saw a new RE and have a whole new insight to my problems and she did several medicated IUI cycles. As children we were close do this just seem to be something else that brought us closer. Then I find out from my mother she is pregnant. Ok, no big deal..my mother had just seen her at another family function out of town and I probably would of told people too if it had just happened. So then she reaches out to me directly to tell me and I am absolutely over the moon for her. She gave me hope to keep going when I was in a pretty low place. I was so excited for her. The first time I had ever been excited about someone else being pregnant since we started trying. 

Months go by, she announced her pregnancy on Facebook, I like it and tell her how excited I am, she posts pictures of her ultrasound, I'm so excited to see them. Then may rolls around and I quickly booked a trip to Southern California for a convention that only happens once every other year. My mother asks if she can come along and I say yes. Cut to the second week of June. My mother is at another cousins party in our hometown and apparently this cousin is going to throw my pregnant cousin a baby shower. Oh that's nice I tell my mom. Apparently they had already picked a weekend and it's the same weekend as the trip I had planned and paid for. Hmm that was a bit of a dilemma but surely my pregnant cousin would understand why I couldn't come. I don't say or do anything about it as of course people can change minds and I wanted to make absolutely sure they were sure with the date. My pregnant cousins texts me to ask if I was coming. In asked her the date. It's for sure the weekend i planned something. I declined and told her that I had already booked this trip and it had turned into something of a mother daughter trip. She's angry and upset. I chalk it up to her hormones but I made her a offer. I offered to come and visit once the baby was born. I think that was a fair trade. And plus why wouldn't I want a little alone time with my cousin? She doesn't respond. 

My grandfathers 80th birthday was the weekend before the baby shower. My mom and her siblings threw a big party for him in the town I live in. Pregnant cousin attends and talks to me as if nothing is wrong even though she still hadn't spoken to me previously since she text me about the baby shower. Cool I thought, everything is good. The next weekend comes and I go on my trip and she has her baby shower. I didn't see any pictures of it on our social media sites but no big deal. She was never a big social
Media person anyway. 

I went to California with my mom to our hometown where we had a elderly great uncle who was very ill and it was time to say good byes. Pregnant cousins parents are there I asked my aunt how the baby shower was and if she had gotten everything she needed and my aunt was very cold and short with me. Ok. Just trying to make conversation lady. 

Cut to the beginning of October. My mother texts me to tell me my pregnant cousin is in the hospital having the baby. Exciting! The day is finally here! I don't get texts from anyone else but I understand. I text my cousin to congratulate her. A couple of weeks go by..no reply. Ok, I'll send another text to see how she's doing. Again, no reply. :( ok then...so I go on her Facebook to see if she has posted anything about the baby. Unfriended. At this point my feelings are extremely hurt. So I guess she is just cutting me out of her life because I didn't go to her baby shower. I guess my offer of making a trip out just to see her wasn't good enough. This is all I have to go by since I'm not getting any type of response from her. I tried friending her again since texts are not doing any good and days go by and nothing. But I can see through mutual family members Facebook her commenting on other things. I deleted my request. I just don't understand why she would suddenly turn her back on me. My mother wants me to go with her to visit the baby but at this point I refuse. If she's going to cut me out because of her selfishness then I really want nothing to do with it. 

I guess I'm just astounded that someone who went through the exact same journey would just cut someone out of their life. Now especially I feel isolated and alone in the family as everything is about her and her the baby and I am literally the only married cousin without children. We were supposed to stick together and be grateful for these hardships as they would make us appreciate what we have even more. So to throw away a relationship like this is just so selfish.

A little intro...me (33) and my husband (30) have been actively trying for 13 cycles. I know it doesn't seem like a long time but we have also not avoided pregnancy for 3 years.  I have a son from a previous marriage who is 8 and after I had him I was diagnosed with Stage 4 endo.  I had an endometrioma removed and then a second surgery to remove severe adhesions to my left ovary. I found out then that my right ovary could not be removed from the adhesions on my uterus.

We have consulted with a RE but the closest one to us is in Jacksonville which is a 2.5hr drive.  We have a second consult in a week for a ultrasound and a repeat semen analysis.

But I can't, because I know some of them have their own infertility problems and have been trying for years for their little one.

After reviewing hormones and talking with our docs we decided to move forward with the micro-TESE dissection sperm retrieval surgery which I had this past Thursday.  Unfortunately, they were not able to find any sperm in the samples that they took.  We are both very sad and trying to deal with the news and the fact that I won't be able to have biological children, although, I've felt mostly numb about it so far with some moments of sadness here and there.  I'm guessing it will hit me eventually - maybe after the physical pain fades.

We are considering using a donor as I can't take away my wife's chances of having biological children and she definitely still wants kids.  I think it could be strange at first, but I know I would grow to love the kid, which is what it sounds like happens in most cases from what I've heard/read.  It just still doesn't seem real that I'm not able to have biological children.  It's like it's not happening to me or something - I dunno.

Anyway, I mostly wanted to provide an update, and ask if anyone knows of any resources or online forums for men who are unable to have biological kids.  I think having a support group of guys in the same situation would help - online or other.  Please let me know - I couldn't find anything using Google.

We have Blue cross blue shield of Illinois. 

Please any idea. 

What Is Covered?
Plans must cover the diagnosis and treatment of infertility the same as all other conditions. For
example, they may not apply any unique co-payments or deductibles for infertility coverage.
Benefits shall include, but not be limited to:
• testing
- 2 -
• prescription drugs
• artificial insemination
• invitro fertilization (IVF)
• gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT)
• intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
• donor sperm and eggs (medical costs)
o procedures utilized to retrieve oocytes or sperm and subsequent procedures used to
transfer the oocytes or sperm to the covered recipient are covered
o Associated donor expenses medical expense, including but not limited to physical
examination, laboratory screening, psychological screening, and prescription drugs, are
covered if established as prerequisites to donation by the insurer


What Are The Limits?
Benefits for advanced procedures such as IVF, GIFT, ZIFT or ICSI are required only if you have
been unable to attain or sustain a successful pregnancy through reasonable, less costly medically
appropriate infertility treatments for which coverage is available under the policy.
The benefits for advanced procedures required by the law are four completed oocyte retrievals per
lifetime of the individual, except that two completed oocyte retrievals are covered after a live birth is
achieved as a result of an artificial reproductive transfer of oocytes. For example, if a live birth takes
place as a result of the first completed oocyte retrieval, then two more completed oocyte retrievals
for a maximum of three are covered under the law. If a live birth takes place as a result of the fourth
completed oocyte retrieval, then two more completed oocyte retrievals for a maximum of six are
covered. The maximum number of completed oocyte retrievals that can be covered under the law is
six.
One completed oocyte retrieval could result in many IVF, GIFT, ZIFT or ICSI procedures. There is
no limit on the number of procedures, including less invasive procedures such as artificial
insemination. The only limitations are on the number of completed oocyte retrievals.
NOTE: Once the final covered oocyte retrieval is completed, one subsequent procedure (IVF, GIFT,
ZIFT, or ICSI) used to transfer the oocytes or sperm is covered. After that, the benefit is maxed out
and no further benefits are available under the law.
NOTE: Oocyte retrievals are per lifetime of the individual. If you had a completed oocyte retrieval in
the past that was paid for by another carrier, or not covered by insurance, it still counts toward your
lifetime maximum under the law.",t2_kwovw,False,,0,False,Insurance pays Life time max benefit for Infertility is $10K. but Illinois Infertility laws says different story.,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_3r99vu,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1446525292.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Insurance pays Life time max benefit for Infertility is $10K. but Illinois Infertility laws says different story.

Sometimes friends and family say really hurtful things in regard to infertility.  They might be uninformed, mal-informed or not understanding of your situation. 
Over the weekend I got some bad news about my IVF cycle and I’ve only shared this information with very few people because even people that I care about tend to “stick their foot in it.”

I have a group of friends that I write emails to because we are scattered. The responses are mostly favorable and supportive. One friend tends to give platitudes and I left her off a few emails.

I tried to include her on an email and she responded with platitudes, general speculation and this postscript: 
> 
> *“Btw, my take on your Diminished Ovarian Reserve goes something like this: the total amount of eggs is determined by the time one is born -> this is influenced by the hormones while in the womb -> you were born with a twin brother -> your mother's womb was confused as to what hormones to secrete for what sex -> you were exposed to less of whatever hormones needed to create what would later be eggs -> and your brother may or may not have issues with his sperm as well.“*


I was beside myself with rage and hurt. I didn’t know exactly what to say to get across all of the feelings that her email brought up. I do value the friendship, so I consulted with a mutual friend and came up with an email.

I hope these words can be useful to some of you out there.

**Update:**

My friend apologized for how she responded. She meant to be supportive. Unfortunately she ended the email with:

>(Call it a fertility problem - you're not infertile right now, with all the eggs growing inside you)

After my previous email was about how ""I have diminishing ovarian reserve and I'm scared that my cycle will be canceled because of lack of response/growth""

This morning my cycle was canceled from lack of response. bleh. Someone is getting a link to Resolve and being booted from the email list.

Quick background: unexplained IF.  AMH: 2.5, CD3 LH: 8, estrodiol 38, unmedicated 7DPO progesterone: 12.  Clockwork 25-26 day cycles in which I ovulate every month.  Husband has stupid amounts of sperm.  Have done ALL THE TESTS: normal karyotyping, RLP found slightly elevated PAI-1 (a clotting issue, so I take lovenox post transfer) but nothing else.  Normal hysteroscopy. 

Three 2.5mg femara IUIs with 1-2 follicles, failed.  Two injectable IUIs with 5 days of 75mg gonal-f that produced 3-4 follicles each cycle, failed.  First IVF was long lupron with 150 gonal-f and 75 menopur and going into retrieval I had 11 follicles but ovulated half away.  Of the 5 retrieved only 2 were mature, 1 fertilized and didn't make it to blast.  Second IVF we did antagonist with 150 follistim and 150 bravelle. Cycle started great but half of the follicles disappeared as we added the ganirelix, and 5 follicles retrieved, all mature, all fertilized, 1 blast which was PGS normal.  FET failed.

My RE and I both believe I over-react to suppression and therefore the micro lupron with 150 follistim and 150 bravelle with no birth control or any suppression prior might work better.  He also thinks I should do a lap to check for endometriosis (no symptoms of it).

Just finished 3rd round of Clomid, the first two rounds there were no results, so the dosage has increased this time. Tomorrow I have to give myself a shot and I'm freaking out! I was hoping to get my neighbor to do it who is a nurse, but then I found out it has to be done at 10pm! I also have little freak outs each time I'm sent to the lab for a blood test. Just wondering about others experience with giving yourself a shot?
Also, other random question, I'm five months into my new job. It's an office job for a utility company, direct supervisor is male and young, and manager is male mid30s.

I don’t recall why. Maybe it was something like “You will obey me, period!” (There was definitely an exclamation point at the end instead of an actual period.) Anyway, I made a little joke about the period to the kids sitting around me, and she called me out on it. Maybe she forgot about the other meaning for the word “period”, and why that would be funny to a group of 5th graders. Since I had yet to experience it, I didn’t realize periods are no joke.
When you go through the adolescent lessons on puberty, you learn all about how and why these happen to women on a monthly basis. (Because you become a “woman” when your period starts. Clearly.) I recall becoming a woman during my 6th grade year, but I don’t know if anyone else around me recognized me as one. I mean, I still had a bedtime and wasn’t allowed snacks without permission. So, yeah, somehow the whole becoming a woman thing didn’t work out quite as well as I had hoped.
But, as much as I didn’t enjoy these monthly events that would strike as soon as I decided to wear my white jeans (because…the ‘90s), we just had to remember that this was happening so that we could have children one day. I mean, that is all you think about as a teen, right? Ok, I never actually thought of that. Literally, not even once. Until I got older and got married…
~Push through the cramps. (Which are so much worse than men could imagine.)
~Push through all the money you spend on, ahem, feminine products. (Knowing those commercials about frolicking on the beach during this time of the month are a big ol’ lie.)
~Push through the bloating that somehow seems to last all month. (Sigh.)
It will be worth it.
Except it’s not. At least, not for every woman. At least, not for the woman who cannot conceive. At least, not for me. You see, my period is a major insult. I mean, after 12 years of marriage and infertility, how else can I view it? I was recently chatting about this with a single friend in her mid-30s. She’s not sure she will get married or have children, and she feels the same way. Insulted. And I got to thinking…how many women are cramped (pun intended) into this boat with us? Insulted that they go through this super annoying event Every. Single. Month. for no reason. If the inability or lack of opportunity to have children is the injury, then the period is the insult to that injury. As if nature is laughing at us. And the only recourse you have is a heating pad, a bottle of Aleve, and chocolate. Lots of chocolate.
Oh, but ladies, I’ve decided we can’t stop there. We can’t just accept this thing that puts us down and shames us for what it symbolizes. Instead, we can hold our heads high and recognize that it’s just a symbol of a different plan than what we anticipated. Or hoped for. Or prayed for. Comedian Gracie Allen used to say “Never place a period where God has placed a comma.” Maybe that’s what I’ve been doing all along…looking at this aspect of being a woman as a constant reminder of the finality of what I don’t and can’t have instead of as a natural part of life that doesn’t define what God has planned for my future. Including motherhood.
My friend and author Holley Gerth wrote me this encouragement recently: “For all of us our period is not the end. Because God is still writing our stories. And even on the days when we’re frustrated, discouraged or even hopeless we can trust He’s not done yet–and neither are we. Yes, in a way a period is an end. But it’s also what makes a new beginning possible.”
Yes. A million times yes.
This doesn’t diminish the pain of infertility, but it does help us to recognize that God still has a plan for our lives. And it’s good. Because, friend, God is good…and He sees you. To the woman who cries each month when she realizes she is not pregnant, He sees you. To the woman who has painfully experienced a miscarriage, He sees you. To the woman who begs God to open her womb, He sees you. He sees all of us, and He knows our pain. Our monthly periods were not meant to bring more pain, and we can work together through the taboo to not allow them to bring us down.
One day, our periods will just be a memory, but what God has done in our lives and through us in the lives of others won’t be. That will be what lasts forever and that will be what matters most. Whether it involves biological motherhood or not. Hey, I might even miss that “time of the month” because it was an indicator of youth, and an excuse for the moodiness (because…hormones).

I only had embryos survive to transfer day. Went through another stim cycle. Two nights before my retrieval I started bleeding and they had to cancel my transfer. They were able to retrieve 15 eggs, 9 were viable, 8 fertilized, and 5 made it to transfer/freeze day. When they went to thaw embryos on Tuesday, they were instructed to only thaw as many to get to the two that were planned to be transferred. By some miracle, the first two they thawed, survived and looked strong! 

All went well with the transfer and the TWW begins. My doctor said that implantation occurs 2-3 days after the transfer, typically. So if it worked, I could be pregnant right now. I sure hope so. The last round I spotted the next day. But with this one, I haven't spotted at all. I've had a couple cramps, but nothing serious or major. I'm trying my best to not find symptoms that aren't there, but with everything I've been through with this, it's hard not to. If this round works, I will be able to announce to my family of the good news. I have this whole idea planned out. I really hope I will be able to do it.  

Since this round is a little different, they have put my Estrace for estrogen, and baby aspirin which started when I was stimming. They didn't want me to hyper stim and just kept me on it. I have two friends who were able to finally conceive after being put on baby aspirin. I'm on progesterone injections now and starting Tuesday or Wednesday, I'm switching to vaginal progesterone because the amount of medicine being injected is causing my hips to feel bruised. I'm so excited to no longer feel like a pin cushion. 

I guess I was just wondering is if there was anyone who got pregnant through IVF and if you noticed any early symptoms. I know everyone is different, but I'm just curious.

102,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Dear fertile friends, 

Let me preface this by saying: I love you. I’m about to list a few things that can send someone struggling with infertility into a downward spiral of resentment and despair. It’s possible that you have done or said some of these things yourself. It’s possible you have even done or said them to me. 

Please know that I'm not writing this to accuse you of any wrongdoing. I do not blame you. Many of the activities that cause suffering among infertile people, like bringing children out in public, are completely normal and objectively inoffensive. That’s one reason why infertility, for the most part, is invisible. How can I share my suffering with my friends, when (a) they’re causing it and (b) they’re not doing anything wrong?

But I’m tired of treating infertility like a big secret. It exists, it sucks, and if people can bring their kids out in public I might as well bring some of that suckiness out in public too. Here are nine things that drive infertile people crazy:

**Other people’s children.** This year, even thinking about my office Halloween party - which is attended by 30 or 40 of my co-workers’ kids - made me nauseous. Other people's pregnancies can also trigger emotional breakdowns. I have been known to burst into tears when people announce their pregnancies … so if you’re coming over to dinner, and you have big news to share, text my husband first so we can emotionally prepare. 

**Fertility-bragging on Facebook.** I know you don’t feel like you’re fertility-bragging when you post your ultrasound photo on Facebook. I never thought I was vacation-bragging when I posted vacation photos on Facebook. But to someone who doesn’t have kids, or doesn’t have money for travel, “sharing” is remarkably similar to “rubbing it in your face.” I’ve completely changed my Facebook behavior since realizing this. Well, not completely: my profile photo still depicts the one time I successfully balanced in forearm stand. Call me a hypocrite, but I consider yoga-bragging to be acceptable. 

**Articles about how [“People without kids just don’t understand.”](http://www.scarymommy.com/5-things-people-without-kids-just-dont-understand/)** These articles generally assume that people without kids have no common sense or awareness of the world around them. Actually, I have heard that having a baby is tiring. But it's still the most amazing thing you've ever done. And it doesn’t even shock me that your grocery list is different from mine. 

**When fertile people say, “The key to getting pregnant is just to relax and have a good time.”** There’s no way to sugar coat it. This is the worst. Remember how I said in the beginning that I don’t blame my friends for saying or doing most of the things on this list? That doesn’t apply here. If you said this, I remember, and I’m still holding a grudge.

If you have said this, I’m guessing you got pregnant on the first or second try. Perhaps you would like to think that you did something special to deserve such good fortune. ""If only,"" you think, ""I could share my knowledge with the ignorant infertile masses."" But the truth is that *everyone* is relaxed on the first and second try. The despair sets in around attempt #6.

**Taking progesterone.** Ugh.

**Those absolutely awful [Clearblue ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch3rpg9fJpY).** They feature Youtube videos of joyful “reaction shots” to positive pregnancy tests. It’s like Dr. Evil works at Clearblue and purposefully devised an ad that would intensify the suffering of infertile people. The first time I saw it, I said to my husband, ""Maybe we should have gotten a reaction shot when we told my parents about our miscarriage.""

**When people talk about how amazing it is to have kids.** There’s a common misconception that if you educate people without children about the fact that their lives are empty and meaningless, they will immediately jump on the parenthood train. Here’s a tip: anyone childless, married, and over 35 is either trying to catch the train or has decided to take another journey altogether. Either way, we don’t need to see you beckoning from the first class car. 

**The fact that infertility is a disease only rich people can afford to treat.** A round of IVF costs about $12,000. I am fortunate to live in a state that mandates that insurance companies cover infertility treatment, and my employer offers excellent coverage. I also know that, as difficult as this process is, I will eventually have a family because I will be able to afford adoption, which can cost $20,000 or more. But people without resources have few options for treating infertility. 

**When fertile people say, “You never know what you’re going to get with adoption.”** If there’s one thing infertility teaches you, it’s that you never know what you’re going to get with anything.

I have a few extenuating circumstances for fertility-- I have MS which makes taking the fertility drugs risky, I am 35, and I also have irregular periods which are probably at least some of the time anovulatory. I am also, as you may have guessed from the title, a lesbian.

Any advice on how to proceed with MS and fertility drugs would be appreciated. Partner and I have an upcoming appt with my gyno to discuss TTC. Luckily, my gyno is a partnered lesbian who has gone through this process herself so I'm anticipating plenty of support and great advice from her. 


I was also hoping that I might grow my personal network of ladies and LGBT families who are also TTC. Mostly looking for a bit of community to share the process with who might also offer support and guidance along the way. It doesn't appear that there is any sort of subreddit for this and since we cannot conceive without intervention I thought I might try here to see if anyone else here is in the same situation. 





Thanks!

LH: 9.09

FSH: 7.77

Prolactin: 20.73

TSH: 2.34

AMH: 7.34

So my LH is somewhat higher than FSH, which I know isn't ""good."" According to the doctor this still does not mean I have PCOS, she says the ratio is not high enough that it means PCOS, and there are no detectable cysts on both ultrasounds that I had. Can someone provide a bit more insight about this? Is there any way to ""lower"" my LH? I did start taking thyroid medication today, which she believes might help balance the LH and FSH levels to be more optimal.

Also with prolactin: mine is on the high end of normal. Should I be concerned about this? Should I try and lower prolactin?

And one more query: is it normal to have pink/brown spotting for three days in the earlier half of the cycle? I stopped taking Vitex this cycle after consulting with the doc (I told her I felt like it was just making my cycles longer and longer and not ""doing"" anything) and I'm wondering if this is a side effect.

113,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello,

I've been a longtime reader of this subreddit through the past three years and am enormously grateful for the wealth of information and support (though indirect) I've gotten from the men and women who have posted here.  We've found ourselves at what feels like a crossroad and I would love to hear from any of you who have had similar experiences as I try to wrap my head around next steps.

Basic Hx:

I am a 31/F. Husband is 32/M. Neither of us has known health issues.  My cycles have always been clockwork 27-29 days, detectable ovulation/LH surge.  

* Pregnancy #1 (6/2012) MMC detected at 11w4d, fetus measured at 9wk5d. D/C to resolve.  No testing.
* Pregnancy #2 (11/2012) Blighted ovum.  Discovered on ultrasound at 8wk. Natural MC at 9 wk. 
* Pregnancy #3 (5/2013) resulted in live birth of healthy girl. Prometrium 200mg support through 14 weeks, 81mg aspirin through 36 weeks. No complications.
* Pregnancy #4 (1/15) CP; natural MC at 5weeks.  

RPL panel results all normal with exception of heterozygotic prothrombin mutation (GA2120). This was discovered via a Counsyl genetic panel after loss 2.  RE suspects some sort of maternal ovarian failure issue that has never been explained to me in better detail than ""your eggs contribute to a higher than normal amount of aneuploid embryos.""

We just finished an IVF/PGS cycle whose goal was to produce a batch of embryos to be PGS tested at Natera, hoping to end up with several euploid 5/6 day blasts for a FET at a later date.  Retrieval was completed last Tuesday and the results have really floored me.  Can anyone see a pattern here or shed any insight into why this would have failed so badly, and whether or not there is anything we could do differently? It's been a long, brutal couple of years and I'm running out of emotional stamina.

IVF #1 : Luteal Phase Lupron protocol.  No BCP to start due to clotting.  Started 20iu lupron SQ 7 days after P4 surge on CD19.  Went for day 10 baseline to discover high estrogen (186) and a 18mm follicle that had recruited during the initial LH/FSH surge.  Not good.  Cont'd at 20iu x 5 more days, at which point E2 had dropped to 16 and follicle was shrinking.  Started stim meds: 75 Menopur, 225 follistim, 5 lupron for two days.  Follistim increased to 300iu on stim day 3 due to lower than expected E2.  The remainder of stims went seemingly well; evenly paced progression of follicles, until e2 started skyrocketing around day 9.  dropped menupor and reduced follistim to 150 x 2 more days.  HCG trigger 5,000iu IM.

Retrieval: 23 follicles, 19 eggs retrieved, 12 mature.  8 fertilized w/ ICSI.  Day 5: 4 remaining, none at blast stage.  Day 6: 2 blasts.  These were biopsied and frozen.  We are still awaiting PGS results from Natera on the final surviving two.

My reaction as these numbers came back has been an unequivocal, stomach-churning WTF. I knew the hypothesis was that we'd have more abnormal than is typical...but the loss rates we are seeing seem crazy.  I will be shocked if even one of those biopsy results is normal.

I'm so tired and sad, and tired of being sad.  Does anyone see anything noteworthy here? I'm trying to prepare myself for having run out of options.  Thanks to you all in advance.

EDIT: I forgot that we did have one strange pair of results.  During my first RPL panel, my AMH level was 0.82, but with a normal FSH (cannot remember the exact number off hand but it was textbook normal).  Retested at new RE and this time got a level of 3.72. At the time, the huge change was written off as some sort of fluke, either physical or with the first lab, but I've never been comfortable with that and this new apparent egg quality disaster makes me wonder about this all over again.

I was so humbled when I received the message from T.Heuvos, and thought it was so considerate and kind of you guys to be thinking of us.

Here's a small update- I don't know if I should post it to the main wall or not. Last week, he did receive the diagnosis we were expecting: Stage 4 Metastatic Colon Cancer. :/ This typically has a very grim prognosis at this stage and type of cancer, but our oncologist and all of the surgeons are very optimistic. They think that with aggressive treatment and surgery, they will be able to get it all. So instead of just trying to make him comfortable and extend his time, they are going to try a ""curative"" treatment.

He has his first chemo treatment Monday and he's doing alright now- basically, he goes for a few hours and gets one infusion, and then goes home for 2 days with a pump of another kind of chemo. While he's on those, he's also on a steroid. This is making him feel MUCH better during this time. It's onboard in case of allergic reaction. So when he stops it, we expect things to become pretty miserable for at least a few days, before he starts to rebound. And then we repeat that all over again, every 2 weeks.
The plan for now is to do 3 months of chemo treatments, then a colectomy and recovery from that surgery. Followed by another 3 months of chemo, and then if they can, they'll do a liver resection and try to take out the unhealthy part of his liver where the biggest/main tumor is at. It's going to be about 9 months for this whole cycle if it all goes as planned.

We are so hopeful, and also so scared. On the ""TTC"" front, my RE is still unhelpful. She prescribed me OTC-Lo, and didn't address my other concerns about PCOS symptoms/side effects or wanting to lose weight. I need to schedule an appointment with my own doctor and see if she'll let me try some things I've always wanted to, but couldn't because we were actively trying- I think spironolactone for hormones and acne and maybe vaniqua or something for the hirituism. I have to lose weight also- I've gained almost 50 pounds from all of the fertility treatments. I'm going to see if my neighbor, who is a personal trainer, will help guide me to losing some weight, at least help me keep myself on track. 

Apparently this type of chemo has a a 10% chance of infertility for men, which is really low.
If he beats this thing, after we wait whatever required amount of time (I think it's 2 years after chemo), we will be trying again. Even if we don't, I'm going to try to focus on taking care of him, and on getting my body into a much healthier place.

I'm rambling now... sorry there are a lot of things in my head! But I wanted to say that I'm so glad I'm a part of this community. I haven't been able to really sign on and respond much, but I have been reading, and thinking of so many of you who are going through your own challenges and difficulties! Much love to you all.

Husband is 23, I am also 23, and we've been trying for 6 cycles/5 months. Not a terribly long time, but I was diagnosed with Endo earlier this year. I wasn't told what ""stage"", just that it was closer to the severe side; had two endometriomas, and several sites of ""classic, textbook"" endo adhesions, including on the ""top and back"" of my uterus. Tubes are open, and didn't lose any parts of my baby-making organs...been lucky so far. But the Endo diagnosis in May is what prompted us to start trying the first week of June.

We're now on Cycle 7, and my OBGYN wanted to see me in ""6 months if not pregnant"". That would be the first day of December. I know her plan is to put me on Clomid (we talked briefly about it) even though I already ovulate regularly and have never had an issue with ovulation/irregular periods. I am okay with this if it results in a pregnancy, even though I heard the side effects are terrible and there's a risk of multiples. Should I push for Femara instead? Should I do this step through an OB or wait to do it with a RE?

HOWEVER, I don't really care for my current OB (knowledgable, but awful bedside manner), and have plans to switch to my husband's clinic anyway. This will happen when I get my insurance cards in a few days. I want to see an OB and try to get a referral for a RE right away as well.

Anyone have any guidance to figure out what infertility treatments will be covered under insurance? Is this just a ""go check out the insurance company's website"" sort of thing? Also, any tips for picking a RE clinic (I'm seeing SART recommended in the FAQ but not entirely sure what this means)? I live in SE Wisconsin if anyone has any recommendations close by.

Also, if anyone else has Endo...I've had a tough time figuring out when it will ""come back"". I was supposed to have a higher chance of conceiving for the first 6 months after surgery and no dice... not even a CP. But yesterday (CD 1) I got a horrible period-related migraine. I ended up in vomiting...never happened to me before, and have definitely had worse migraines before. Also, my abdominal cramps/pain/etc seems to be getting progressively worse. I am worried that we wasted time trying naturally when we should have been more aggressive from the start. So, when did your Endo grow back? Should I be trying to schedule another U/S to see if endometriomas are popping up again?

After that surgery, I had another few rounds of monitored clomid + trigger, and then 4 IUI's.  

When I moved on to IVF (with a different doctor) a SIS showed polyps and I had surgery to remove them yesterday.  There were over 30 polyps!!  I was shocked at this number - these polyps have grown over the course of a year since my uterus was ""cleaned out"" a year ago.

Other than the endo and polyps - we have no other factors.  No sperm issues, no AMH issues etc.

After I get my period I will start my IVF cycle over.  Now my husband and I are wondering if we should jump back into IVF so quickly.  Obviously with 30 polyps removed wouldn't IUI and even a natural cycle have a pretty good chance of success?

My RE says the polyps can return with 2 months and it's best that I jump into IVF right away.  I am just curious if others have been told the same about how quickly polyps can grow.

I went in to see our RE today and get a battle plan for the next three months. She wrote me an Rx for 50mg of Clomid but confessed to me during my baseline ultrasound that it really wasn't going to do anything and I'm wasting my time because I ovulate on my own. She's canceling the cycle if I have more than two mature follicles at my mid-cycle ultrasound due to my age, but says she would talk to us about the risks see if we are comfortable with proceeding with more follicles.

Questions: 

1. Will Clomid really do nothing for me since I ovulate on my own? 

2. Husband and I would feel comfortable still going for the cycle if there are three mature follicles. Is that a bad idea? 

3. Should we just save our money and save up for the $1,000 IUI?

139,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone, I wasn’t sure where to go with this but I’m having a difficult time with all of this and my husband doesn’t seem to understand.  
I don’t know where to start so bear with me please.
&nbsp;

Okay so in my family I have:  
Dad - Enabler?  
Mum - Semi narcissistic  
Older Brother - Physically, emotionally and sexually abusive  
Younger Sister - Loving and wonderful
&nbsp;

I love all of them, except for my brother I don’t see him as family and I don’t want to know him.  
My parents are unaware of the sexual abuse as well as some of the physical abuse my sister and I suffered at his hand.

&nbsp;

For most of my life, I (thought) knew that my brother couldn’t have children. He was in a pushbike accident that rendered it impossible.

&nbsp;

This all changed when last year, my husband and I had been trying to get pregnant for 4 months and he somehow knocked a girl up.  
At the time, I didn’t really care. I didn’t know we would still be struggling when she was close to giving birth and I honestly held out hope the entire time that he really couldn’t have kids and it was someone else’s.

&nbsp;

Fast forward to September, my fertility doctor told us we would need IVF to conceive (luckily we had embryos saved up from when I had cancer) and so we started scrambling trying to find the money.  
It really amazes me how expensive it is to even just do the embryo transfer. I certainly wasn’t expecting that. And all the medication! I have spent nearly $200 just on the medication for the lead up to the transfer and I need to spend another $200 if I get a positive pregnancy test to keep taking it all until I’m 7 weeks pregnant.

&nbsp;

In the end of September, I’d gone through nearly another entire cycle because we just couldn’t afford to do it yet (we could afford it but other things would have suffered) and that’s when my parents offered to pay for our transfer costs.
We gratefully accepted the offer and started planning for the next cycle.

&nbsp;

Fast forward a few weeks, I’ve had my transfer and hopefully it’s worked. I am able to test on the 30th.

&nbsp;

My husband and I were at my grand-parent’s house having dinner and this is how the conversation went:  
Mum: ""How are you feeling with all the medication mrsthomo?""  
mrsthomo: ""Yeah, I’m fine."" (Trying to brush it off)  
Grandma: ""Why wouldn’t you be fine, what kind of medication are you on?""  
mrsthomo: …………… (Can’t think of anything… awkward pause) ""We’re doing IVF.""  
Grandma: ""Oh riiight, how far along are you?""  
mrsthomo: ………….  
Mum: ""You know I told you the other day, grandma!""  
Grandma: ""Oh yess. So when do we find out?""

&nbsp;

So I think my mother is telling everyone, which probably includes my brother who doesn’t have the right to know anything about me. And I just feel crushed.  
The entire year that we were trying for a baby I dreamed about baking little duck shaped cookies to announce a pregnancy but now it won’t be a surprise and I’m really struggling with all of this.  
I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m so scared that if I say something about her yapping about it to everyone and then we need more treatment then she will tell us to go fuck ourselves.

&nbsp;

I hate this so much. This is not how it was supposed to be.

&nbsp;

My mum also thinks that I care about my brother because I gave them some nappies, picked up their stroller and car seat the week before the baby was born and found information on where they could get the car seat fitted last minute while she was in hospital in labor. Because they didn't bother.  
The reason I did all of this is because I am extremely concerned for this child's well being. It has nothing to do with my brother or his girlfriend whom I have never even met.

&nbsp;

TL;DR My parents paid for our IVF and my mother is telling everyone! I don't really know how I can stop her because I'm afraid if I say something she will withdraw their offer to help us. (She is very unreasonable)

This will be my new primary account as the name on my old was making me hold back on many reddit subs due to the name being to recognizable.

My Husband and I have been TTC for 2 years now, we have known each other for 11 years and have been together for roughly 6 years and got this Year :)

We saw a fertility specialist in 2014 after having been TTC for a year without success. So we got blood test, sperm test, HSG done. 

Results = Unexplained.

Husbands SA was alittle low, First test was really bad so they asked him to redo it 3 months later thinking he might have had a slight fever prior to the test. The Second test they basically just said it was fine for IUI, didn't explain if it was good enough for us to have chance at conceiving without help.

For Me, Everything was fine except I have a BMI of 34. The guidelines in DK says you have to be below BMI35 in order to get help TTC, but apparently this clinic have their own standard and wants me to get below BMI30 before they would even try to help.

I felt like i got sucker punched in the gut, couldn't they have told me this right away?? I **know** my BMI is high and I am working on it but I was within the official guidelines, how was I to know that clinic had its own standard in order to maximize their success rate. I am already doing a Low-Carb diet so the ""help"" they could offer wasn't anything i could use.

On the medical side everything kinda just stood still after that verdict. We continued to try at home but I was getting more and more depressed and that was not helping me loose weight.

<p>I believe that the combined mutation is found in about 5 to 7% of all people who live in United States. In other words, this is extremely common.

We are an interracial couple (asian+european) trying to have a baby. 31yo male  and 28yo female. Never had children before. For the last couple of years we didn't use protection of any kind and we, somehow, didn't manage to get pregnant.


Out of the 24 months, we might have tried 20, or 18. The other months, we didnt have intercourse on her ovulation periods so, I kind of don't count them.


Now, thanks to public health system, we are starting to go to the doctor next month in order to have a look

A year ago, we started this process, but we stopped it after my seminogram, in which the outcome was, IIRC, a 30% less movility than normal. My wife's test was ok. Both blood tests were ok.


Now, we have quite stressful jobs and I want to think it all boils down to this. Most of the times we wait for the last hour of the day to try and do the baby dance: Maybe this is not the best time of the day to do so: We are both exhausted and sometimes, it even feels like we have to ""get it done"" in order to go to sleep. However, this last month, we went on vacation and had multiple sessions of baby making..... with the same outcome. (only one month trym though)


I want to stay positive, but I feel time is running and I'm kind of starting to get nervous. Of course, we will keep on trying but I really need someone to cheer me up on this subject. It's stressing me more even and I think that's not helpful at all.

I wanted to ask for some advices:

-Is it possible to have any incompatibility due to race?

-Are there any tips on when to try and how apart from trying to do it on her ovulation week?. IDK, like, no masturbating the previous days, keep my parts cold to improve sperm production/quality.... etc.

-If I have movility problems, are there any tips? The first thing that comes to mind could be perhaps trying to help the sperm reach it's goal by keeping a special pose preventing the sperm from coming out after coitus?. Nothing weird, perhaps a small cushion under my wife's butt....



Any help will be much appreciated, really.

I am still waiting to get my blood test results back next week. However, I've been contemplating something in the meantime and wonder if anyone has had similar experiences or feedback.

My current job (which I'm not super happy about anyways, and have been thinking of quitting for quite some time) involves working with kids. The building that houses the school also contains a preschool, so the kids in the building range from baby age to ten years old. Essentially, I'm surrounded by pregnancy, babies and kids constantly;  and constantly subject to discussions about these topics. Whenever I remotely don't feel well (nauseous etc) a couple of my colleagues automatically ask if I'm pregnant. (Seriously). So to sum it up, it is really not an ideal environment psychologically to be dealing with infertility. 

The other factor is, if it turns out that I am going to need to do IUI's or IVF, that's automatically going to mean missing work sometimes, and from what I've heard about these procedures, they can be debilitating both mentally and physically. I feel like coupled with being surrounded by a less-than-ideal work environment and potential constant medical procedures, this might really be the time to leave the job, depending on my results.

In summary, I'm wondering if any of you guys have dealt with this dilemma-- has anyone else worked in a similar environment and quit for similar reasons? If so, did you tell your boss specifically what was going on, or did you keep it private?

Some of us were thinking about how if we were friends IRL, we could take her a casserole, or offer help with childcare, or just go over to her house to give her a hug and hold her hand.  But, since we can’t do any of those things, the next best thing would be to send support in another form, and what we’ve decided on is gift cards.  You can help provide an easy meal by getting a restaurant gift card, groceries with a grocery store gift card, entertainment with a movie gift card, or just help with anything she might need with a general Visa type gift card.  The possibilities are almost endless.   All of my local grocery stores have massive kiosks filled with gift cards.  

I’ve run this by pac, and she is fine with it, and sends her love to this awesome sub. She also shared an update about where things are with them, and said it was fine to share it with everyone, so I’m going to paste that at the bottom of this post.  

As for getting any well wishes/gift cards to pac, she has sent me her address, and I will gather everything and send it to her in one package.  If you’d like to be a part of this, post here, and I will PM you my address.  Please get anything you’d like to send in the mail to me by Saturday, November 14th (three weeks from today).  That way I can have everything to her by Thanksgiving at the latest.  

Thanks, everyone!!!

(I hope I've written this okay.  I'm heading out the door to take my cat to the vet, but I'll proofread later. :) )

Here is pac’s update:

>We got word yesterday that he has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, which typically has a poor prognosis and treatment is palliative.

<p>Some of us were thinking about how if we were friends IRL, we could take her a casserole, or offer help with childcare, or just go over to her house to give her a hug and hold her hand.  But, since we can’t do any of those things, the next best thing would be to send support in another form, and what we’ve decided on is gift cards.  You can help provide an easy meal by getting a restaurant gift card, groceries with a grocery store gift card, entertainment with a movie gift card, or just help with anything she might need with a general Visa type gift card.  The possibilities are almost endless.   All of my local grocery stores have massive kiosks filled with gift cards.  </p>

<p>I’ve run this by pac, and she is fine with it, and sends her love to this awesome sub. She also shared an update about where things are with them, and said it was fine to share it with everyone, so I’m going to paste that at the bottom of this post.  </p>

<p>As for getting any well wishes/gift cards to pac, she has sent me her address, and I will gather everything and send it to her in one package.  If you’d like to be a part of this, post here, and I will PM you my address.  Please get anything you’d like to send in the mail to me by Saturday, November 14th (three weeks from today).  That way I can have everything to her by Thanksgiving at the latest.  </p>

When I realized I didn't have the flexible schedule for it, I put surrogacy on my 'future plans' list and started looking into egg donation.
My mom(step mom) was not able to have kids and it was very hard for her. She stepped into my life when my biological mother wouldn't and now I consider her my mom. She was there for me, so she is my Mom.

So dna means very little to me. The implications that 'another me' will be out there means nothing. That child will be the child of their parents, the people who are there for them.

But now that I'm registered and waiting to get selected, I keep trying to imagine things from the other side. Reading stories from couples who've used donor cells and how hard it was to accept. It seems like it becomes'not a big deal' in their pregnancy but before hand....it's absolutely a last resort.

So I'm conflicted...I want to help a couple add to their family. I want to help. I want to just be thought of as a helper, not the 'biological parent'. But I know if I was in that position, Id be angry. Id flip through profiles and hate every one. Id feel unsure of what I meant in everything....was I just a body to grow a baby?
Would people's attitudes towards me be different if they knew the truth?

Then I see stories about children of donors who feel confused or Angry or don't care.

Im sorry if this is the wrong sub. I've been looking at this sub for months trying to understand everything and I've gained a lot of respect for these strong women who want to be a mom they are willing to fight mountains. I've cried, thinking about how many ups and downs experienced.
The closest I've come to your pain was a chemical pregnancy. It hurt. Yet some ladies go through that over years. God...if i can help make that journey end in diapers...

So I'm not sure what my question is. I'm just concerned that instead of being a blessing, I'm the last option being picked and the mother to be will hate me. Will hate that Im part of their process.

Dna means nothing to me but I know it means a lot to others.

I wish I could talk to any recipients and tell them that I have no influence on how amazing their kid will be. That will be all on them.

I don't know how to stop feeling guilty...how does anyone 'pick' me without hating my guts?

Wife (26) and I (32) finally went to the fertility clinic for the first time yesterday, and I also got the results of my third semen analysis: the verdict is that apparently, in spite of a year and a half of unsuccessful attempts and great frustration, I am ""not infertile"". She did say, however, that my values were ""borderline"".

She suggested that we start, as a first step, with ovulation inducing drugs to be able to accurately time intercourse. The drug she prescribed is called Predalon 5000 I. E. and I think I have gathered from the information leaflet inside that the active ingredient is ""chorionic gonadotropin"" (it's all in German, und my Detusch ist leider about as schlecht as it gets). She was told that she has to give herself injections in her lower abdomen at 6 AM for two days, and that we should have sex on those days.

Now here's the problem: neither of us has any experience with giving injections, and I had never even heard of injections being delivered in that part of the body, so I wanted to ask if any of you have experience with this kind of medication. How do you perform the injection? To further complicate matters, the information leaflet says ""Die Lösung wird langsam in einen Muskel (in das Gesäß, den Oberschenkel oder den Oberarm)
gespritzt."" which, according to Google Translate, means ""The solution is slowly into a muscle (the buttock, the thigh or upper arm) injected."" - so no mention of belly/lower abdomen injections here.

Also, should we have intercourse immediately after the first injection? Should we wait until evening? I'm thinking that since my motility tends to decrease with time, it may be better to wait a few hours, but I'm not really sure.

You'd think being told that I'm ""not infertile"" would have cheered me up, but it didn't. I don't care much about being ""clinically fertile"". All I care about is having a child. What use is having most (but not all...) numbers slightly above the WHO defined thresholds if I still can't get my wife pregnant?

Thanks for reading this, and sorry for the wall of text.

I've just finished a round of Femara. My period stopped Monday (CD 5) but since then I've been spotting/wiping red. Its almost like my uterus is too lazy to finish a period. CD3 was also extremely painful, which is very unusual for me. 

So...I'm afraid something is wrong with me. I have an annual appt. scheduled for Tuesday where I'll bring this all up, BUT - I go in tomorrow (CD10) for follicle monitoring and its possible that I'll have to trigger before my appt. on Tuesday. 

So...what should I do? I figure I have a couple options

1. Go ahead with everything, IUI, as planned. 
2. Trigger and do TI, save IUI for next cycle.
3. Skip trigger ($100) and just have TI and basically ""drop"" the cycle. This would basically just save me the $100, BUT it might set me up with big cysts next cycle since it seems without trigger nothing happens. 

I will probably mention the spotting to the nurse at my u/s tomorrow and just see if they can see anything/ have any concerns about it. I had been feeling like I didn't want to ""waste"" an IUI this cyle because I never got a chance to really diet/exercise (not that one month will help THAT much anyway), but I'm also 36.5 and I need to get cracking!

You have 1 heterozygous (yellow) mutation(s). These are generally not as bad as red homozygous mutation, but they may still worth paying attention to. They include:
MTHFR C677T

One function of MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) is to help convert homocysteine to methionine. A MTHFR C677T mutation means that the MTHFR enzyme may have trouble performing its task leading to high levels of homocysteine. According to Dr. Ben Lynch, impaired function of the enzyme can cause or contribute to conditions such as Autism, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Miscarriages, IBS, many birth defects, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Bipolar Disorder, blood clots, Stroke, Chemical Sensitivity, and many other conditions.

MTHFR C677T can also lead to high homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine can be related to MTHFR C677T mutations. While homozygous (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-) mutations indicates reduced activity of this enzyme, it does not necessarily mean there will be high homocysteine levels in a clinical setting.

As S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) accumulates, the COMT enzyme may become impaired. Inhibitiion of COMT can increase dopamine levels in COMT V158M (-/-), but for those with COMT V158M (+/+), the high level of SAH can lead to behavior problems and mood swings according to Dr. Amy Yasko.

My COMT V158M was also heterozygous.

not exactly dr google..  but...  yeah...  sent that shit to my RE.  why the fuck not...

ETA: my cousin died of spina bifida at birth...  my other cousin, her sister is now trying and has the chromosome anomaly my mom has which causes turner's in girls (like myself) so she's been to a geneticist and will be going to an RE for a full workup there.

As some of you know, two days ago, I had an HSG done, and the results were painless and perfect. I had my transvaginal ultrasound today to measure my follicles and schedule my IUI. I was on 7.5 mg of Femara this month, which my Dr said was the highest dose. Well, after today's ultrasound, it turns out that I did not respond to it. I had many follicles, but they were all 10mm or under. Now, my regular dr was out of town, so I had another one that I've never met do it, and she said that we will not do an IUI this month because my follicles were so small. 

I know this issue is minute compared to a lot of other issues on here, but this was a low blow this month. I really had my hopes up that we could do this IUI next week, and now I just feel hopeless. 

I talked with my nurse afterward, and she said she was going to talk to my real Dr on Monday to see what he wanted to do. She said he may want me to come back up for another ultrasound next week sometime. 

My nurse also said that since I don't respond to Clomid or Femara, our next option would be Gonal-f or Follistim, which they are hesitant to do because they really want to avoid multiples if possible, and since I'm so young, I would have an increased chance of that. At this point though, I just don't care. I'll take anything I can get, and I have to try all of the cheaper options before we consider IVF.

There are no known issues with me and I've gone through all the testing. Our treatment plan included 3 IUIs with clomid, then IVF. We've done two of the IUIs with 50 mg of clomid each time, post wash count was 13.5 & 16.5 million but only 7 million highly motile each time. I've only had one follicle for both IUIs and I was really hoping for 2 to help our chances. 

But if we were to do injectable meds for our last IUI, the price would be 4-6 thousand dollars with all the monitoring (including meds), while our IUI with clomid is only $550. Our price for IVF is $8800, plus meds. So final price estimation would be around $14,000 total for IVF (obviously just an estimation). Our clinic has a very high success rate for male factor, 78% for our age group and ICSI is included in our IVF price.

There are no known issues with me and I&#39;ve gone through all the testing. Our treatment plan included 3 IUIs with clomid, then IVF. We&#39;ve done two of the IUIs with 50 mg of clomid each time, post wash count was 13.5 &amp; 16.5 million but only 7 million highly motile each time. I&#39;ve only had one follicle for both IUIs and I was really hoping for 2 to help our chances. </p>

<p>But if we were to do injectable meds for our last IUI, the price would be 4-6 thousand dollars with all the monitoring (including meds), while our IUI with clomid is only $550. Our price for IVF is $8800, plus meds. So final price estimation would be around $14,000 total for IVF (obviously just an estimation). Our clinic has a very high success rate for male factor, 78% for our age group and ICSI is included in our IVF price. It almost seems more economical to just do one more clomid cycle, and put our money towards IVF instead. Is that a totally insane way to look at it?

Got into a row with the husband as I'm freaking tired to handle all the call and the appointment. As the clinic always treat the lady as the patient, even in MFI case.

I'm afraid our cycle will be push to December, and then, it won't be covered by our medicare, so we won't do it.

The nurse in charge f the PGS did a fuck-up in may, so we could not do a cycle in June. Un July, the surgeon was on holiday. So, we had our first cycle in august, 11 months after the first RE appointment.

Oi, I left all my husband info, he is the freaking patient.</p>

<p>Hum..... now i&#39;m worry something is wrong with our november cycle. Why can&#39;t they left details message or send email.</p>

<p>Got into a row with the husband as I&#39;m freaking tired to handle all the call and the appointment. As the clinic always treat the lady as the patient, even in MFI case.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid our cycle will be push to December, and then, it won&#39;t be covered by our medicare, so we won&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>The nurse in charge f the PGS did a fuck-up in may, so we could not do a cycle in June. Un July, the surgeon was on holiday. So, we had our first cycle in august, 11 months after the first RE appointment.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stand all the stress and the worry and the freacking trying to reach someone.</p>

<p>I have to do shitload of overtime in the next few days, I can&#39;t be stress with this. GAKKKKKKK.</p>

Went back today- no baby, no yolk sack even. Just a gestational sac measuring 6w3d or something. I'm 7w4d today.
