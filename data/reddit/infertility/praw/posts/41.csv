Reluctant to mention it here, but it is probably relevant to my plan and really hoping for some more advice about what we should push for with the re. Please don't read if that mention will be upsetting for you :(

 Here is the story and sorry for the wall of text.
Me 38 yo, possible ovulatory issues, shortish luteal phase and lowish progesterone (all borderline )

Husband 41 lower sperm count (in the 10 million range).

All other hormone levels, thyroid, hcg, sis looked normal.

One successful conception/pregnancy after two years ttc just as we were starting treatment. 

Now we are doing  ivf after 3-4 months trying and 1 failed iui. We got 4 pgs normal embryos from one ER.

Then we spontaneously got pregnant again last dec in between er and fet. Had a horrible mc at 6 weeks last jan with retained products of conception (bled for like 6 or 7 weeks) and possible infection (no elevated cbc but it sure smelled until i took antibiotics). Finally cleared it up with a hysteroscopic resection, no  d+c. We did a few weeks of estrace to build back the lining and decrease chances of scarring. The whole process took like 5 months of misery.  My re felt pretty confident there was no scarring and linig looked good.  He is very meticulous and perfectionistic, and not super communicative about his clinical reasoning, but I believed him when he didn't push for a repeat SIS or diagnostic hysteroscopy.  Maybe a mistake, and def #1 on my list to ask for at our next appt.

After the estrace we started a fet cycle and my lining was up to 8.5/9.0 while on  6 mg oral estrace and 2 mg vaginally per day.
That fet failed and while I know that it might just be bad luck (seems to be a suspicious amount of that in my life right now), we want to make the most of our remaining 3 embryos. 

Obviously there might be some scarring etc so we will push for at least an SIS, but wondering what else (if anything) to ask about.

Because we have had two succesful implantations, I haven't been super concerned about receptivity issues or that ERA test -- can this change after a miscarriage? 

Is there any point into doing genetic testing on ourselves?  It's not going to change what is in our embryos and we're not goinng to do another ER. 

What is the deal on the immunological stuff?  It seems like there is not consesnus in the literature/field about whether the information and treatments are actually effective.

Wondering too about getting a second opinion, although I'm probably not going to switch drs for the FETs left since it seems like its best to have the same lab freeze and thaw them.

**WHO IS BERNICE YEUNG?**


Bernice Yeung is a reporter for Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting who covers race and gender. She has covered topics ranging from sexual assault among low-wage immigrant workers to human trafficking to the explosion of girls in the juvenile justice system. Her award-winning work has appeared in a variety of media outlets, including The New York Times, The Seattle Times, the Guardian US, the International Herald Tribune, KQED-FM and PBS Frontline. 


**WHO IS JONATHAN JONES?**


Jonathan Jones is a freelance investigative reporter based in San Francisco. Much of his work has focused on business, health and human rights. In 2013, Jones’s investigation into assisted living for ProPublica and PBS FRONTLINE exposed serious problems with Emeritus, then the largest assisted living corporation in the United States. His investigation into the relationship between Bridgestone/Firestone and the infamous Liberian warlord Charles Taylor won two Emmys, an RFK Journalism & Human Rights Award and the Investigative Reporters and Editors award for the best multi-platform project by large organizations. 


**Summary of the story Bernice and Jonathan have been working on:**


For the millions of American women struggling to get pregnant, in-vitro fertilization is the medicine of miracles. But the price of the fertility treatment is steep, financially and emotionally. Failure can be especially devastating, and a round of IVF can cost upward of $20,000. Unsuccessful patients are often motivated to try again. And again. The only federal law that explicitly addresses IVF requires the government to publish fertility clinic success rates. But this antiquated measurement system, coupled with scant oversight, obscure the differences between the best doctors in the business and those who run troubled clinics and push a risky practice. 


**PARTICIPATION IN THE AMA**

We encourage anyone with interest in the investigating fertility clinics and their practices regarding success rates to come along on Thursday June 1st and participate. If you can't make it, please reply to this comment or message the mods and we will make sure it's included in the AMA.

As an update, we purchased our medications from IVFPrescriptions.com. I placed the order on June 1st, the package shipped on Sunday June 4th, and arrived on June 7th. All meds arrived as expected and safely. The cold pack wasn't frozen but it was still cold. We purchased Menopur, Cetrotide, Gonal-F, and Pregnyl for an amazing price.

IVFPharmacy did not have all of the prescriptions we needed. They also don't ship in an insulated cold pack but they say that's okay and explained why. No particular reason we didn't choose IVFMeds.com other than what I had already said.

37,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, everyone! I'm new to this subreddit so I thought I'd introduce myself. My boyfriend and I are trying to conceive for the first time. We are both 30 years old and we're eager to grow our family. I have [Kallmann Syndrome](http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/kallmann-syndrome) (with anosmia). It's a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and it makes it difficult for me to conceive.

I was put on birth control as a form of hormone replacement therapy when I was 18 years old. The synthetic estrogen kickstarted my puberty and gave me monthly periods—though they are hormonal withdrawal bleeds and not true menstruation as I do not ovulate. (My FSH and LH levels are super low.) I was told then that I would have trouble getting pregnant and to come see a reproductive endocrinologist when I was ready to start a family.

In January of this year, I visited a fertility clinic where the doctor was extremely optimistic about my chances of conceiving with the proper cocktail of hormones. I began my first cycle of Menopur (with Ovidrel to trigger ovulation) in mid-March. My partner and I opted for timed intercourse that cycle because his semen analysis indicated no issues on his end and I had 4+ mature follicles. We were not successful.

Round #2 began in late-mid-April. Similar protocol (Menopur+Ovidrel) but we chose to do an IUI. Again, I had at least 4 mature follicles. Unfortunately, this attempt was also unsuccessful.

We are about to begin our third cycle. This clinic likes to do three attempts on the same protocol before moving on to something else. (We'll be doing a second IUI.) We're hoping this one is it but it's hard not to lose hope when previous attempts have failed.

My numbers, from I understand, tend to be on track while I'm on the hormonal cocktail. However, my endometrial uterine lining is on the thin side. (At its thickest, it measured 6.41mm this past cycle.) Everyone I've seen at the clinic always clucks sympathetically but I have not been placed on any protocol to help thicken my lining so I'm led to assume that it's good enough.

It's also stressful in that I had to pay for Menopur out-of-pocket for my second cycle—and will likely have to do it again for this upcoming cycle. (My insurance provides a lifetime maximum of three cycles of therapy. However, because I refilled my original prescription twice for the same cycle, it counts as three fills. I'm trying to fight them on this but it's exhausting.) I was also traveling during the last cycle and needed to be seen by another clinic for monitoring and ended up paying out-of-pocket for that visit, too. (I'm going to submit a claim to my insurance company to be reimbursed but I'm not holding my breath.)

My condition is very rare so I do not expect anyone to be able to understand my situation completely but it's nice to be in a space where you all can at least commiserate—and I can do the same for you.

I'm going to end this by saying infertility sucks and I'm already tired of being a pincushion.

Hi all - old user here (new name, stupid password problems). I've only had one short-lived success in the past two years of struggle. In my excitement, I converted my Glow Fertility to Glow Nurture and promptly lost the pregnancy. 

The Glow app, my partner, and my RE are the ONLY people who knew my due date, but somehow I started getting emails from Similac StrongMoms with cute little ""Week NN: Get ready for XYZ!"" tips. The due date they had was right, so my first thought was that the Glow app sold my information. Glow obviously denied this, so I told them to at least have someone check on security because the only other possibility is that Similac StrongMoms stole my information. I ""unsubscribed"" from the Similac emails, but continued to get them week after week. Even after speaking with multiple Help Desk folks at Similac and ""unsubscribing"" every week, I just got my ""Week 39"" email.

I forwarded these to the FTC along with evidence of Similac's violation of the CAN-SPAM act, which mandates that unsubscribe requests be honored within 10 days. I'm pretty sure nothing will come of it, but... WARNING WARNING WARNING. Use Glow Nurture and subscribe to any Similac programs at your own risk. You might lose the pregnancy and be reminded weekly of your loss and continued infertility.

 my problem: [Details](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/5g3xrv/no_one_knows_whats_wrong_with_me_i_think_i_might/). TL;DR I have chronic pelvic pain since Nov 2016 and no one has been able to figure out anything related to it and its only remedy is itself. To this date, it controls itself and I am under no medication. 2 things trigger it: sexual arousal and sitting on hard surfaces. Since 3 months ago or so, my semen amount seemed to lower. 

I visited the endocrinologist and she told me to get more bloodwork done. She wanted to make sure of the results from the first time. 

Events leading up to the case with the endocrinologist:

- First few Ultrasound results showed that my testicles were too small for my age range. 

- Up to that point, I sounded and looked like a man. Pubic hair, manly voice, I shaved facial hair 3 times a week, and I was attracted to women. Actually, I still am!

- Urologist told me to do my first bloodwork and semen test. 

- Bloodwork: Everything except LH and FSH is normal. Those 2 are very abnormally high for some reason. 

- Semen test: Very abnormally low amount of seminal fluid and practically infertile. i had abstained from masturbation for 4 days. 

- Decided to see the endocrinologist. Did another round of bloodwork. 

- Bloodwork part 2: Everything except LH, FSH and testosterone is normal. LH and FSH are high. Testosterone is low. At the time of the bloodwork, I had abstained from masturbation for 4 days. She recommended that I start with the hormone therapy ASAP. 

I would have to probably do it for the rest of my life......

What's left for me to do:

- I have a meeting with a fertility specialist in June. 

- I have to sign up for another sperm test 

- There is a requisition for a physio that I have not touched because my pain levels are going up and down like a sine wave and I am not in control of them 

- My Urologist referred me to an MRI scan and a neurologist. That was 4 months ago. Nothing heard from either. 

- One more thing: Check my chromosomes to see abnormalities 

---

I feel totally helpless. It's one of my fears and it has come true. Now, I must live a disabled life. 

I had never had sex; still am a virgin. I am a shy person IRL. 

I am 22 years old and my life is ahead of me and knowing that one day I might  not be able to have my own kid is making me teary eyed right now.

<p>What&#39;s left for me to do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have a meeting with a fertility specialist in June. </p></li>
<li><p>I have to sign up for another sperm test </p></li>
<li><p>There is a requisition for a physio that I have not touched because my pain levels are going up and down like a sine wave and I am not in control of them </p></li>
<li><p>My Urologist referred me to an MRI scan and a neurologist. That was 4 months ago. Nothing heard from either. </p></li>
<li><p>One more thing: Check my chromosomes to see abnormalities </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>I feel totally helpless. It&#39;s one of my fears and it has come true. Now, I must live a disabled life. </p>

<p>I had never had sex; still am a virgin. I am a shy person IRL. </p>

<p>I am 22 years old and my life is ahead of me and knowing that one day I might  not be able to have my own kid is making me teary eyed right now. </p>

<p>I have other things in my life that I felt very insecure about; things that drove me to suicide twice before, then this thing appeared scat in the middle of it.</p>

A post here not long ago reignited a long simmering concern of mine that there is such little support for low income people who have IF. In this category I include those who are (for lack of a better word) structurally IF because of sexual orientation (queer or asexual), single, as well as everyone who has the historically recognized medically diagnosed forms of IF. 

My interest on this issue comes from three places: I personally had to wait to ttc relatively late (38) because I was single and therefore financially strapped (and remained so until 39 or so when my now wife and I became mutually financially supporting). Also, as a queer woman who didn't win the right to be married until late in life, I am SOOO excited that younger queer folks now can do so much earlier, at all of the same developmental stages of their lives as heterosexual people have always been able to. This means more younger queers are likely to be thinking about starting families at a time when they have a lot less money and literally no idea what to do if their original ""turkey baster"" plan doesn't work. I also grew up poor and because of my work in the non-profit financial services sector, am very aware of the financial constraints that poor people face (you know the saying, ""its expensive to be poor""? it applies to a lot of the financial services that target poor people). After finally getting to a place where I make a good living and have a partner to share expenses with, I get hit with diagnosis of unexplained IF that has sent me through years of IUIs and 2 IVF cycles including one with donor eggs. The financial drain has been *intense* and I'm sure most of you have experienced the same financial stress.

I'd really like to start pulling together a set of resources for low income folks that can support the financial side of things. I'm thinking it should include advice and resources to build saving and strengthen credit to access lower cost loans, as well as grants and shared risk/shared cycle programs. 

So, knowing what you know having been through what you've been through, what advice would you give a younger, poorer you (not assuming we're all on the same financial footing here now, just that years ago we all likely made less than we do now), or a young queer or single cousin who dreams of children, regarding financial planning? 

Bonus if you can suggest actual programs you know about (like the UC Davis shared donor program).

I'm not quite sure where this is going yet. If we develop a good enough list, maybe it can live as a resource on the wiki page?

I promise you at the end it's ok.  I'm not off the deep end, I'm not truly going nuclear.  Bear with me...I just have to get it out.

Since we have failed all 4 IVF's and found out that using an egg donor is more expensive than IVF and we don't have a pot to piss in, we have counseled my family on how to be aware that certain situations will be harder for us because we now will be childless.  I'm not calling it childfree because, well, the word free means you choose it and I definitely didn't choose this.  All are on board...we're all cool.  

Let me tell you about my youngest brother.  He's had a rough time at life - he was part of the very first movement into ADD and ADHD and was actually in the first human testing of Ritalin.  His social skills are...lacking...and even though he's in his 30's, he acts like he's 18 most of the time.  He's had some trouble with the law, he never finished college...just has made a ton of bad decisions.  Almost 3 years ago, as he and his gf were moving in with my parents because they had no money, no jobs...etc, they announce that they're pregnant.  Oh boy.  They really don't have any business having unprotected sex because, well, again, no job, no money, they're living with my parents..........but ok.  A baby on the way, and almost 2 years ago we were blessed with my niece.  His GF gets severe post-pardum depression, which is real folks.  I'm not taking anything away from this.  We tried to speak to my brother to encourage her to get help...she gets really funny about what toys niece can play with, what she can eat (or in her case, no food just breast), picks her up at the drop of a hat...and now at 19 months old, my niece cannot speak one word (because, really why should she use her words when they do anything for her when she just grunts?) and is developmentally behind.  There is a TON more, but I won't bore you with those details.  

Fast forward to this past Christmas when my brother finally has had enough because she hasn't gotten any help for her post pardum, she has no job, she doesn't clean up around the house and...and...and...the list can go on forever.  So he kicks her out.  We were really proud of him for sticking up for what he needs and what will, ultimately, help his daughter because his GF is hindering her and her growth mentally and physically.  

They started going to counseling for co-parenting, it ended up being couples therapy, and then yesterday, he failed not only me, but my parents and *more importantly, himself*.  

They are expecting another baby.  He called to tell me on the phone because ""he's seen my FB posts about not keeping infertile people in the dark and didn't want to do that to me.""  He says ""Well, we have some news...you're going to be an Auntie for 2!""  Like, I'm supposed to be happy about this.  She still doesn't have a job, she is seeing someone for PPD, but my niece still isn't speaking, still isn't developing, and at 19 months is still breastfeeding and supplementing with *some* real food.  She still lives with her parents, technically, and oh yes, she receives aid from the state because well, no job.  

I was doing pretty good - I was dumbfounded, speechless, but just said things like ""um....ok.  Wow....um...wow.""  I never congratulated and I started to be nasty (on the tip of my tongue) and verbally said ""nope.  You've made this decision....so yea.  Good luck."" 

He begged me to speak my mind.  Begged me.  So I let him have it.  I told him he had NO BUSINESS making another baby.    I told him that he should have kept his dick in his pants.  (I secretly think she told him she was on BC and didn't take it on purpose.)  I told him that she looked at him like a fucking meal ticket.  Was she ever going to get a fucking job and you know, contribute to the finances of their now growing family?  He says...she has gotten a job...as a part-time nanny.  Really?!!?  You think it's a good idea for a woman who suffers heavily from PPD should be a nanny???  Then he says ""She doesn't have it anymore.  She's all better.""  You. Fucking. Idiot.  It's called post-pardum...after birth.  SHE'S NOW PREGNANT AGAIN YOU DUMB SHIT.  It's going to happen again.  Then he says ""but she'll make about $500 a month.""  You idiot - she should be making at least $500 a week.  You have a house, you have cars, you are now going to have 2 children to feed and clothe and provide for.  I'm arguing with him in circles....there is more, but I'll save you the anguish.  

So, I walk away.  I tell him I hope he's happy, but I'm done.  I hang up and am walking away - I won't help them in any form.  I won't enable them to mooch more off me (toys, clothes, etc), to enable their terrible choices - I won't buy clothes, I won't babysit, I won't buy toys...nothing.  I'm done.  I'm sacrificing the relationship of my only niece and her unborn sibling because I just can't.  

And you know what, I'm ok.  I'm ok with this decision to walk away.  I'm removing myself from their toxicity, and oddly enough, it doesn't bother me.  Now, I'm not saying that I didn't literally fall to my knees, sobbing, calling him and his gf some very choice words that I hardly EVER use...asking my husband how that....not nice word at all...gets to have more and I can't even get one.  It's horribly unfair, but I'm walking away.  I can't change the decisions they make, but I can change my reaction to it and this time, I'm not swallowing their bullshit.  I read this quote a while ago, which has really helped me.  ""It hurts the most when I have to pretend it doesn't.""  (and forgive me, but I forgot who said it).  I'm not pretending anymore.

117,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, I was directed here from r/stilltrying.

Note: Miscarriage, Secondary Infertility

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over a year now and I've decided to make an appointment with my Frauenarzt (basically a gynecologist, I guess) to see what happens next. I'm feeling a little lost in the system, to be honest, and like I don't know if I'm going in the right direction. I know that everyone says to go to an RE, not an OB/GYN, but we live in Germany and I don't even know what an RE is in German or if it's a separate thing, and after we had two early miscarriages last year, my Frauenarzt suggested that we should go back to her if we had a third or after a year of trying.

However, I'm feeling a little frustrated, because my husband knows that he has a balanced translocation, I don't know all of the details, but his parents have known from birth. He was told when he was 16 but it seems that they just had generally crap information about it because he was told that the translocation had caused his dyslexia (wtf) and also that he'd probably never be able to have children (also wrong). I don't know if there are any records of it, and my in laws are difficult to get information out of, also, of course, this was around 30 years ago now. One of his cousins also has the family translocation, and very kindly sent us her information about it, but this was a generic NHS information leaflet, which contained exactly the same information we'd already managed to find online. We don't know which chromosomes the translocation is on.

I'm finding resistance from all of the medical professionals I speak to. Most of them don't seem to have heard of a translocation and they want to do standard fertility testing, which doesn't make sense to me as I have carried a successful pregnancy to term (with a different partner), and we already have a starting point. All of the websites of the Frauenarzten who specify that they deal with fertility issues talk about the more common causes of infertility, possibly with a little side note saying that genetic issues can be a cause in rare cases, but mostly never mentioning them at all. I can try to get an appointment with a geneticist directly, but there are only two in the whole city, and neither of them are taking new patients. (I'm waiting to hear back from them to see if they have a waiting list).

I suppose my questions are this:

- Does anyone know the German system and is it right to go to the Frauenarzt for this or should we begin somewhere else?

- If you've had a balanced translocation, how was this picked up?

- Should we try to contact the cousin?

- Exactly how freaking rare is a balanced translocation that nobody ever seems to have heard of it? Am I crazy for thinking that they should know? Apparently the Karyotype is a subject on their school leaving exams!

1) I went in for my 3rd monitoring ultrasound today for this IVF cycle and she noticed a slight, I guess thickening in the uterine wall. She's never mentioned this before and this was my normal doc, in the past my uterus has been ""beautiful"". So of course I asked if she was thinking fibroid, and she was like, well maybe but I doubt it, we would want to do a saline sonogram before an embryo transfer anyway (we're freezing everything so this hasn't come up yet) but my guess is it's going to be normal.

So I'm not panicking or anything but would it be typical for a fibroid to just come out of no where like that?? What else could that be? Is it normal to have variation in uterine wall thickness month to month? This was my first cycle on letrozole. 

2) I already had an HSG and it was HORRIBLE. Like, a total nightmare and I had a complete panic attack. This stuff really freaks me out and feels so invasive, so the balloon was terrible and the catheter and everything. It was like the worst thing I've ever done (and it was on valium and I took that vaginal suppository that dilates your cervix the night before). I have sworn I would never, ever do it again. Period.

Since then we have performed numerous test including genetics on him and they can not find the reason at all for his MF especially the severity. All of his test are normal and the've concluded that there is no blockage. We got a second opinion, based on the test results, that Doctor said the same thing. 

Fast forward to today, I am on the last few days of stimming and about to take my trigger shot for IVF with ICSI. Everything is going well, and I am responding nicely to the shots.  I went in this morning for typical bloodwork and ultrasound when the Doctor tells me that she has been talking with my husbands urologist, and they feel that when they collect my eggs they want to inseminate only HALF of them and freeze the rest. This is, of course due to my husbands male factor she states. Depending on the quality of the semen they have frozen and the fresh they will collect on Thursday, they will know better on how to continue. 

Has anyone ever heard of this or has gone through this? I would think that because of the male factor that we would need to inseminate All of the mature eggs, as our chances are already up in the air/stacked against us concerning actual fertilization and so on. We need as many eggies as possible is what I've been told over and over again, so why this???? 

This is my first IVF cycle, so I am quite nervous, anxious, and now extremely confused as to what is going on. What do you all think of this new recommendation that was given to me today? I didn't know what to say when I was told so I just said the typical 'OK' like a dummy and left. Now I am really starting to question (as well as cry x10), and just need some sound advice. 

**Edit One:** I went ahead and emailed the nurses at the clinic. They responded by stating that the Dr. is considering using only half and freezing the other half so that I: a) would not have to do another cycle and there would be eggs available for future use b) Would like to use donor sperm if my husband's sperm doesn't mix well with my eggs.. They also mentioned that many couples want their eggs (never mentioned embryos) frozen. I was told that my egg reserves are really good, so I find it difficult to understand why I should freeze eggs...

**Edit Two:** Considering everything that has been said by you all, it definitely doesn't seem viable to freeze eggs.  Everything has been fine up until this point and it really is disappointing especially since things will be happening in the next few days.

**Edit Three:** Thanks everyone for your responses. You all have been incredible. 

**Edit Four:** My doctor's office called today and wanted to get 2 new samples the day of the procedure. Is this common? I was told that he needed at least 3 days to build up sperm, so hearing this, especially so close to the retrieval date has me more on edge than ever.

I would think that because of the male factor that we would need to inseminate All of the mature eggs, as our chances are already up in the air/stacked against us concerning actual fertilization and so on. We need as many eggies as possible is what I&#39;ve been told over and over again, so why this???? </p>

<p>This is my first IVF cycle, so I am quite nervous, anxious, and now extremely confused as to what is going on. What do you all think of this new recommendation that was given to me today? I didn&#39;t know what to say when I was told so I just said the typical &#39;OK&#39; like a dummy and left. Now I am really starting to question (as well as cry x10), and just need some sound advice. </p>

<p><strong>Edit One:</strong> I went ahead and emailed the nurses at the clinic. They responded by stating that the Dr. is considering using only half and freezing the other half so that I: a) would not have to do another cycle and there would be eggs available for future use b) Would like to use donor sperm if my husband&#39;s sperm doesn&#39;t mix well with my eggs.. They also mentioned that many couples want their eggs (never mentioned embryos) frozen. I was told that my egg reserves are really good, so I find it difficult to understand why I should freeze eggs...</p>

<p><strong>Edit Two:</strong> Considering everything that has been said by you all, it definitely doesn&#39;t seem viable to freeze eggs.  Everything has been fine up until this point and it really is disappointing especially since things will be happening in the next few days.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Three:</strong> Thanks everyone for your responses. You all have been incredible. </p>

<p><strong>Edit Four:</strong> My doctor&#39;s office called today and wanted to get 2 new samples the day of the procedure. Is this common? I was told that he needed at least 3 days to build up sperm, so hearing this, especially so close to the retrieval date has me more on edge than ever.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had to do something like this? </p>

This seemed too long for a daily post, so I'm commenting...tada!

Weird conversation from today of all days and wanted to discuss with you guys to see what y'all think, so here goes:

A little back story - I've had 3 'official' miscarriages, and if I'm doing the math right my oldest would be 10 this year, right around Halloween. Morbid thought - doing the math on it - but that's kind of where my thoughts go on days like this. Also relevant but not entirely the point, TheOtherPanduhh was raised Catholic, and though my family is no longer part of any church, I was raised some kind of combo of Catholic and Southern Church of Christ. Neither of us are currently ""religious"" but we both identify as 'somewhat spiritual' if that makes any sense at all. Also, his mother knows nothing about my history and very very little about my current medical situation. 

Today his mother brought up IF and struggles, because one of the cousins confided in her and his grandmother that she is having a hard time. TheOtherPanduhh made the comment that in their faith, once you've been a mother you'll always be considered a mother even if you don't have a take-home baby and she agreed. I don't want to get all wrapped up in the religious aspect of this conversation, but for her it stems from her faith. He later told me that the only reason he doesn't celebrate me as he feels like he should is because he knows that those MCs are my 'secret' and he doesn't want to out me, and in the process upset me and cause me discomfort around his family who have little to no boundaries and will most certainly think it's a topic open for discussion.

In the church I grew up in (and the group of parent's friends I grew up around) things like this were and are still never ever discussed, because talking about babies was like right next door to talking about sex, and, well, you just didn't talk about what went on behind closed bedroom doors. Like at all. Like never ever ever. 

What do yall think about this? She seems to be of the opinion that ""God gave us the ability to think, and science comes from thinking, ergo medical stuff is ok, including ART"" though I don't think that's the official opinion of the church, so she says that if you are going through a process and it ""works"" even for a minute that makes you a mother who has lost and should be afforded all the kindness and care of a grieving parent. She also thinks that these parents who have experienced loss should be celebrated on days like today, in a gentle memorial sort of way (although she has a tendency to be about as gentle as a wrecking ball).

I've been consumed with this all day today, and the more I think on it the more it *feels* right, but my logical brain says it doesn't *sound* right. Anybody else have any input?

**Basics about me:** 36, a little overweight, history of cancer/chemo and related blood clots (nearly 20 years ago). Regular cycles, ovulate fine. Suspected endo (cyst on left ovary). Polyp removed during hysteroscopy Feb 2017.

AMH: 3.98 ng/mL (last collected 10/2016)

FSH: 4.2 mIU/mL (last collected 6/2015)


**My husband:** 38, overweight, well controlled type 2 diabetes. All testing indicates no MFI.


**Prior treatments:** 5 cycles IUI with Clomid. 4 rounds 50mg Clomid, 1 round 100mg. 


**Stim/monitoring schedule:**

No suppression, told to call clinic on CD1

**CD01:** scheduled CD3 baseline scan

**CD02:**

**CD03:** baseline scan and bloodwork, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox (b/c blood clot history)

**CD04:** 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD05:** 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD06:** scan, bloodwork, .25 Cetrotide, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD07:** .25 Cetrotide, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD08:** scan, bloodwork, .25 Cetrotide, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD09:** .25 Cetrotide, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD10:** scan, bloodwork, .25 Cetrotide, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox

**CD11:** .25 Cetrotide, 75 Menopur, 200 Gonal F, 40 Lovenox, 10,000 hcg trigger

**CD12:**

**CD13:** Retrieval


On CD10, the doctor almost scheduled me for a CD12 retrieval, but thought that instead of 8-10 eggs, he could get 10-12 by pushing to CD13. I had a lupron trigger ready to go because of OHSS concerns, but was told to trigger with hcg alone because my estradiol wasn't too high and the RE didn't see a concerning number of eggs. 


**Egg/embryo stats:**

28 eggs retrieved (waaaay more than anticipated)

16 mature

14 fertilized w/ ICSI (clinic does ICSI for everyone)

10 blasts at day 5

Remaining 4 embryos had stopped growing by day 6


**Aftermath:** the cycle got converted to a freeze-all after the surprisingly high number of eggs retrieved. I got OHSS, which showed up as big time fluid retention, some difficulty breathing, and general exhaustion. My bloating was gone within 4 days and my energy was back within a week. I was told no more than necessary physical activity for the first week, and no vigorous activity for 3 weeks. 


**Insight on reasons for our infertility:** I'm still trying to chase down a straight answer, but the nurse who gave us our fert report told me that there was some agglutination (sticking together) of the sperm, and in a way that would not have been picked up on a sperm analysis. She said perhaps that was the reason we hadn't been able to conceive naturally. If that were our issue, IVF+ICSI would be how they would treat it, and that's what we did. The whole explanation still feels odd to me, so I plan to ask about it the next time I see the doctor. But... if true, it's one example of how IVF can be diagnostic.

**Future:** I'm doing a natural prep cycle this month, and will start my FET cycle with CD1.

I finally made the leap here from TFAB, I've been TTC for a year and a half. I'm 24 and struggling. My cycles are normal, I've gotten a CD3 blood test, internal/external ultrasound of my ovaries/pelvis, HSG, Pap smear, and std tests. Everything came back normal. Husband just got his SA results which were normal. I don't know if I'm ovulating, temping didn't work for me and opks were inconsistent at best.

Finally going to see a specialist at the end of the month. I cannot carry twins due to my cerebral palsy so they've told me clomid is out. And I just found out IUIs are covered but IVF would be $13,000 per treatment! :(

I just looked at adoption prices (I don't want to foster to adopt at the risk of loving the child and having it taken away) but the average cost of private adoption in California is $35,000-$40,000. I thought it was around $10,000-$15,000.

I feel lost and scared, I've cried twice this week. I don't know how to handle this. I just want to be a mom. I'm not rich by any means and I'm feeling hopeless after hearing all of those numbers, especially since a couple of them aren't even guaranteed.

Like, I couldn&#39;t stop.  I feel ashame, but honestly, when I think about it, I just want to cry and yell. I should be happy for them, but I can&#39;t. I am just angry, and hurt, and sad. Ibdont know how yo cope with my emotions; I mean, it should be a happy occasion, but I feel as if they have don&#39;t it on purpose. How rational is that??? They don&#39;t even know we have been trying. Anyways, I just thought,  may be you would understand. My husband tries, but the poor dear does not really get it; he did tell me he is not as happy as he would like to be, but he is still dealing with it better than I am. </p>

I am 35, partner is 39, MF infertility, TTC for 3 years, 3 failed IUIs, 2 IVF cycles, waiting on FET transfer. 
My dear friend encouraged me to share the unfortunate events of the last few days, in case anyone can relate, and because they are a nice window into the emotional mine field of living with infertility and just trying to be a normal human person. 

We went to visit my husband's family this past weekend and first there was a birthday party for our one year old nephew with hundreds of kids and families in which one person asked if I was pregnant (nope, weight gain from the hormones, but thanks for noticing!) and most people stood around either complaining about being parents or talking about how amazing it is. After his sister commented that maybe not having the stress of my old job will help with the situation (I was recently laid off), we removed ourselves after 20 minutes. 
Then we went to visit my husband's dying grandmother in the hospital who waited for him to go to the bathroom before she asked why we hadn't given her any grandchildren. 

We drove to the beach let out a primal scream. 

Then this Monday we found out two friends gave birth over the weekend, both who started trying WAY after we did (one who has had two kids since we started trying) and another friend blithely texts that she is pregnant, even though she knows everything we are going through. A snapshot of our lives, which, I am sure you can relate to.

I have been on HRT for months prior to this (Estrogen and then progesterone for a monthly withdrawal bleed) and before I was on that, I almost never ovulated on my own while I was tracking it.

Then, he said based on my CD3 labs (again, here they are):

FSH 13
AMH 0.07

Are low for my age (38) and more like someone in my 40s (thanks doc).

He said no one with my numbers got pregnant at Kaiser, but he is willing to do one pity IUI with injectable Menopur ? And if I don't produce more than one egg, then that's it with IUI.

He mentioned IVF and even donor egg. Ok. IVF I was expecting, donor egg no. 

The worst is my husband. He's mad at me. In my past life, I was a former partier. Drinking and smoking. So if that is why shit is the way it is, of course it's my fault.

So Fuck me right?

So other than not getting drunk at 9 am, what do I do now? Does it even help to ""get healthy"" for this cycle? I guess it couldn't hurt. 

I don't know. I'm kinda pissed it took the doc three weeks to drop the I word on me. My period is going to start soon anyway, so this cycle would be a bust.

But I thank this sub, because until I came here, I think I would have starting brawling on the phone.

He doesn't want to do AFC, and HSG I haven't done.. I still won't know why, I never got pregnant after that one time in my 20s. And I wish I had better insurance then so I would have known in my early 30s.

By choice I have canceled my FET and converted it into a mock transfer for the purpose of doing a Receptiva biopsy for endo. I did the first biopsy back in January which resulted in elevated markers for latent endo (no symptoms at all except recurrent implantation failure). Did 2 months of depot lupron which put me in medical menopause and since in my family, menopause causes hair loss, I started losing hair ( a LOT). I started taking collagen peptides (Vital Nutrients brand) to help with the hair loss and did that for the same 2 months and *just this morning* made the connection that what helps hair and nails growth must likely also help endo tissue grow and I researched it and yep. Found this old study correlating collagen and endo: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1374044.

Lots of other (not medical research) studies sites also discuss collagen and endo as linked so I freaked out. I may have well counteracted the lupron with my daily scoop of collagen peptide out of vanity. So, I sent my dr the study, she hadn't seen it and thought it was an interesting link. We agreed to test again with a mock transfer and see how we do.

I've been working on the campaign for SB562, the [Healthy California Act](http://www.healthycaliforniaact.org/), which is essentially a ""Medicare for all"" bill. It would replace private insurance with ""comprehensive"" universal healthcare with no co-pays, deductibles, or premiums, for everyone in CA. I put comprehensive in scare quotes because of course it doesn't cover infertility/ART. You can see the text of the bill [here](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562). It was only just introduced and there will be at least 18 months of wrangling before it gets to the governor's desk (which will only happen if we put enough pressure on legislators not to kill it before then).

I think we can get ART coverage in there if regular people like you and I work together! However I'm just a baby organizer and I'm not sure the best place to start. I feel like we should find a SB562 supporter in the CA legislature and start pressuring them to write it in. Nancy Skinner, who represents [the East Bay](http://skinner4senate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/a2011_SD09.jpg), is on board with the bill and she is my state senator so I am ready to put the squeeze on her. 

Are there other people in her district here? Or people elsewhere in the state who'd like to coordinate efforts? My RE is excited about it and wants to help too -- anyone else at an academic practice want to talk to your RE too?

At the very least I would be happy to collect letters from people around the state who are affected, because of IF diagnosis or being a queer/trans couple. Any other ideas? Raise a fuckton of money and hire a lobbyist? We deserve coverage! Let's fucking get it!

This sub-reddit has taught me to be an advocate for myself within the impersonal 'medical-industrial complex' - so thanks! I’ve been following along with your stories and progress since around 2015, when I was deep in denial about my own infertility - at the time, I was only a year into trying.  Now, I have three years under my belt. At first I couldn’t shake the thought that it would happen naturally, and then as I moved on to more and more procedures, I thought that whatever current procedure was underway would succeed. I am now post hope, but not yet willing to give up. 

After 5 IUI’s (2 with clomid and trigger; 3 with FSH injectibles and trigger), 1 diagnostic laparoscopy and ablation of small amount of endo, 1 IVF cycle and still no answers, I am hoping for some insight from the wealth of collective knowledge of this group. My partner is 32 and I am 36. My partner initially had low count on 1st semen analysis, but subsequent SA’s were within normal range. For me, other than Stage 1 endo (like smallest traceable amount), I don’t have any known issues that would cause infertility. I have never been pregnant. 

Here's a summary of my procedures and some questions to follow:

**AMH** (tested on Sept. 2015) - 27.33 (high end of Medium Range - Canadian scale)

**IUI** #1 and #2 - small amount of clomid, high responder - negative

**IUI** #3 and #4 - FSH injectibles, dominant follicle - negative

**Diagnostic laparoscopy** and ablation of the smallest amount of endo to be found

**IUI** #5 - FSH injectible, dominant follicle - negative


**First and so far only IVF (early January 2017):**

CD1 - AFC: 10 right; 8 left

Drugs: Puregon (166IU) and Menopure (75IU) starting on CD1; Orgalutran starting on CD9 to CD12; Trigger on CD12

Estradiol level on CD13 = 16,331

Lining on CD14 = 13mm

**Retrieval on CD14**: 21 eggs retrieved; 20 mature; 17 fertilized with ICSI


**Post Retrieval**

Day 2: 15 embryos remaining

Day 3: 15 remaining

Day 4: 12 remaining

Day 5: 11 embryos still in transition, none made to blastocyst stage as of 7am

Day 6: 3 embryos (grades: 2BC, 3CC, 3BB) made to blast and were frozen


**freeze all cycle b/c potential for OHSS 

**I did not get PGS or PGD testing - not available in my area

**FET #1** - medicated

CD1: started 4mg of estrogen (Estrace) 2 times daily

CD10: lining 11mm

CD13: started progesterone suppositories (Endometrium) 3 times daily

CD21: FET day - transfer of best embryo (3BB)

Beta 12dp5d (May 5): negative

**Q’s for you**:

* What happened to embryos post retrieval between Day 5 and 6? I heard that 50% loss is to be expected, but we had over 70% loss!?! In my follow-up appointment, my Dr said it was an egg quality issue. Really? How do they know? Has anyone else had a similar drop off and what was the explanation?

* Next steps - further testing, or should I do another embryo transfer? My hesitation is due to having gotten a yeast infection from all of the suppositories and I wonder if any associated inflammation affected my transfer. Did anyone else experience an infection from FET suppositories? 

* Has anyone done back-to-back FET's or is it generally recommended to take breaks between?

* Does anyone have a similar history as me? If so, what is your strategy moving forward? Are you seeking additional testing?

In summary, the film follows several infertile couples who have entered a contest to win a free IVF cycle through Sher Fertility clinic in Las Vegas. The couples submitted videos explaining why they should be chosen and then a panel from the clinic chose a winner from the top 10 videos that received the most votes online.

The contest portion of the film made me so angry. I cried through the first 30 minutes thinking about it. All of these couples deserve to win. All of US deserve to win. I found it terribly unethical to get the hopes up for all of these couples and only one is chosen, for just a single cycle. If you want to give away a cycle, fucking give it away randomly, you don't need to put everyone through this. And as we will know, IVF does not always equal baby. I was relieved to learn they have since stopped hosting the contest.

The rest of the film was realistic. They followed the treatment for several of the couples (the runners up got discounts on treatment). A few of them had failed transfers or miscarriages then had success. One couple never had a baby by the end of the film. Though of course the contest winner ended up with a baby because everybody likes a happy ending, Hallmark channel style.

There was one moment in particular that got me right in the feels. One of the women was pursuing treatment as a single parent. She worked as an actress and Lady Gaga impersonator. She had a huge smile and a certain brightness just radiated from her at the beginning of the film. Later on in the course of her treatment when she's attending a support group meeting, her face is like a mask, all of the brightness seemingly drained from her. I feel the same way.

We are likely not able to do IVF due to cost so I&#39;m wondering how concerned/bummed I should be right now.  Any thoughts/input you have would be appreciated.</p>
