I have been TTC for 14 months but knew a few years ago that I’d have problems due to super high FSH along with a missed period for 4 months.  I have high FSH, low AMH, low AFC and low estrogen, making it look like I may be in peri-menopause at 39.

Since going through this over the last year, many of my friends have gotten pregnant.  The worst of my emotional distress from ttc has been from 12/18 until now, although I have been feeling a little better lately from taking better care of myself and considering donor eggs.  

In any case, a few weeks ago my best friend told me she was pregnant with her second.  When she was pregnant with her first, I threw her a baby shower, made all the decorations by hand and made a painting for her baby.  Since she told me she was pregnant this time I haven’t talked to her, only texted saying I love her but this I hard for me right now and I will reach out when I’m ready.

I feel terrible about it and I know she’s talking to mutual friends about me and she keeps reaching out saying I’m here to talk when I’m ready.  But I’m angry, jealous, feeling all kinds of unpleasant and not-like-me emotions.

Our families celebrate an upcoming holiday together and I just don’t want to go.  I don’t want to deal with people being excited to see her for the first time since her announcement.  I also don’t want to go because I haven’t talked to her and I feel like an asshole and I haven’t figured out how to handle my feelings yet. 

Next up, 3 of my girlfriends in one of my friend groups are all pregnant.  I have two baby shower invites just sitting in my email, and I got a reminder for one today.  I looked at the invites once and tried to forget about them.  I really don’t know what to do.

All of these 4 women are dear friends. I’ve attended their wedding showers, their bachelorettes, their weddings, their baby showers.  I’ve supported and loved them through so many things, and they’ve all done the same for me.  They came to my bridal shower, bachelorette, wedding, birthdays, they’ve been there for me through so much over the years and I love them dear.

But I just can’t celebrate their babies right now.  I can’t. And *I* feel like an immature baby!  Maybe someone should throw me a baby shower for being such a big baby (#dumbjoke).

Doing a stand alone post because this is a lot and I am FIRED UP. I am starting IVF in July. I have zero coverage through insurance. My husband is in a union and we figured out very unexpectedly that we have a lifetime max of $10,000 coverage for infertility treatment that can be used for prescriptions or medical. I am so very very grateful however this is a very unique situation because it isn’t through my insurance it is through the union.

I have been going back & fourth with my clinic about this 10,000 coverage. They have seen nothing like this. I received documentation from the union that states “please be advised that if you bill this office for these procedures we will make payment directly to clinic name at the reasonable and customary contractual rate. Please be advised that there is a lifetime max of 10,000 for Medical services and Prescription drugs related to infertility.”

My clinic is insisting that the union needs to reimburse my husband and I because they don’t know if they “will receive the money from the union.” The note does not say that!!!!!  I’m also not allowed to go through my insurance and have to use the self pay program rates . Either do the IVF cycle fee or Shared Risk Program.

Am I being crazy? Why can’t my clinic bill the union and then my husband and I will pay the remaining balance before we start treatment?

9,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband and I met the RE yesterday. I’m still a little wobbly about this thing, and would love your input. Here’s what we know so far. 

My husband SA (from January) came back low on almost everything. Our diagnosis is male subfertility. Both our blood test were all normal. My AMH was 3.3, which is better than expected (2 to 2.3) at my age (37). Still, the RE recommended another round of blood work, PAP test and SA before getting started. 

Husband lost over 20 pounds, cut back on drinking and started a vitamin regimen (recommanded by our RE). We hope this will help his SA results. 

I will have an ovarian reserve echography with blood work (on next CD3, which should be on May 3rd). 

In May, June and July, we will try unmedicated IUI. RE recommended LH tests (instead of temping) to predict (and not confirm ovulation). Since I’ve had no problem testing for it in the last year, he consisders it precise enough for IUI. 

If unsuccessful, I will have an hysterosalpingogram, and move on to medicated IUI with echography to check for ovulation.

<p>My husband SA (from January) came back low on almost everything. Our diagnosis is male subfertility. Both our blood test were all normal. My AMH was 3.3, which is better than expected (2 to 2.3) at my age (37). Still, the RE recommended another round of blood work, PAP test and SA before getting started. </p>

<p>Husband lost over 20 pounds, cut back on drinking and started a vitamin regimen (recommanded by our RE). We hope this will help his SA results. </p>

<p>I will have an ovarian reserve echography with blood work (on next CD3, which should be on May 3rd). </p>

<p>In May, June and July, we will try unmedicated IUI. RE recommended LH tests (instead of temping) to predict (and not confirm ovulation). Since I’ve had no problem testing for it in the last year, he consisders it precise enough for IUI. </p>

<p>If unsuccessful, I will have an hysterosalpingogram, and move on to medicated IUI with echography to check for ovulation. </p>

I have been struggling with finding a place to vent to for awhile, unable to post of Facebook as the difficult topic and not wanting the attention brought forward about my infertility.  Even as I write that word “ infertility “ I’m finding it tough.

My story starts in 2010, recently married to the love of my life, and having always wanting to have kids ready to start a family.  From the beginning doctors tell me you have PCOS, getting pregnant will be difficult but not impossible.  They started me on  clomid, told me.  keep exercising, eat healthily and we could have success.  At this time I wasn’t overly overweight but could possibly lose a bit, so I did exercise and  eating healthy.  Nothing happened for 18 months, every month. More disappointing the the last.  The clomid messed with my emotional state and having to time intercourse is never fun.. October 2011 I’m pregnant!!, which is perfect my recently married best friend is also pregnant. November 2011 at 10 weeks I miscarry.  This is the most heartbreaking day.  But I’m trying to be confident, the doctor says it’s good that I actually got pregnant, that means you can get pregnant! 

This was the first time I miscarried, it was also the most devastating time, over the next couple of years I tried more cycles of clomid, IUI’s I tried acupuncture, all different types of food avoidances, anything under the sun.  My problem was never being able to talk about my situation, my husband and I talked, but he always said it’s whatever, don’t worry about it, it’s not a big deal if we don’t have kids. I talked a little with my friends, but I have never been one to open up about anything personal.  I miscarried 3 more times ( that I know of).  1 of those at 11 weeks.

The next step was IVF, this would be about a 12 to 15 thousand for one try.  This would come completely out of pocket for us.  This was 2015.  

Suffice it to say my husband and I decided that though we both would like to have children, it is not something we need.  But everyday I think to myself did we make the right choice? Should we keep trying? Or how do I truly make the decision to just be happy with my family.   I’m not sure what I want out of posting on this sub, I’m not sure I need anything, but it does feel good to get my story out.

So I hope this is allowed I just wanted to share my story in a place people will understand. Because y’all know that people tend to just not know how to react to this kinda stuff.

For context, I never wanted biological kids. I’m uncomfortable with the idea of it, uncomfortable with the uncertainty of it all. I always knew I’d want to adopt.

So at the beginning of December I got the news that I’m infertile. Like, fully no coming back zero chance infertile. And it hit me. Hard. I know I never wanted to have biological kids myself, but at that point it was my choice, y’know? And suddenly having it no longer be my choice but something that’s forced on me by circumstance is awful.

In the first two months I was really upset. I cried a lot, it wasn’t easy. It’s been getting easier but I’m still sad about it. I work at a party store and I was separating confetti for a gender reveal party, and even though I think those things are dumb it still made me sad and I was standing there trying not to cry into confetti like a goon 😂.

Humour has always been my coping tactic. If I make the think I’m upset about into a joke, I can tackle it head on but make it less serious and dark. It generally works. But for the longest time I would make a joke and then stop and get actually sad. That’s happening less but still.

Long story short, it sucks, but it’s slowly getting better.

So yeah, I guess I just wanted to share my story. Thanks for listening!

I had a cold. I told myself that, because I hadn't bled on 5dpt like I had my first failed IVF, it was possible. 

It wasn't. 

I came out of the bathroom a different person. My friends noticed. I broke down in front of them. 

Two IVF cycles. Both ending up almost the same. Only half of my eggs were mature. Only two fertilized. Only one made it to transfer. The first time, it was a single 5 day high grade embryo. The second time, it was a good looking 3 day embryo that my doctor told me to shove in me, just in case.

I’m just wrapping up my 15th cycle trying to conceive. We’ve tried pretty much everything with little to no luck. 

We met with our RE in January for the first time. I felt like my concerns were dismissed with a “keep doing what you’re doing”. My GP had done some bloodwork, and a hysterosonogram. The RE didn’t repeat any blood panels, just did an ultrasound, identified no issues to me over the phone, but the report went to my GP saying possible PCOS. No work was done to diagnose this. 

A few days later, I expressed my concerns about a luteal phase defect, and he acknowledged it could be the reason. He prescribed me some progesterone, and surprisingly it seemed to work that cycle. Unfortunately it ended as quickly as it started with a chemical pregnancy. 

Since then, nothing has happened, and we’re on our second following the chemical. 

I have now emailed my doc and pretty much demanded something happen. I have asked to move right to IUI as I just don’t think I can handle any more of the bullshit of continuing “doing what we’re doing”. My benefits cover all of the meds, so if we can’t get government funding for the IUI, the cost will be fairly minimal.

Anyone ever experience something like this with their doctor?

<p>A few days later, I expressed my concerns about a luteal phase defect, and he acknowledged it could be the reason. He prescribed me some progesterone, and surprisingly it seemed to work that cycle. Unfortunately it ended as quickly as it started with a chemical pregnancy. </p>

<p>Since then, nothing has happened, and we’re on our second following the chemical. </p>

<p>I have now emailed my doc and pretty much demanded something happen. I have asked to move right to IUI as I just don’t think I can handle any more of the bullshit of continuing “doing what we’re doing”. My benefits cover all of the meds, so if we can’t get government funding for the IUI, the cost will be fairly minimal.</p>

<p>Anyone ever experience something like this with their doctor? </p>

<p>I feel like I’m stuck in a trap with nothing I can personally do to get myself out of it.</p>

&#x200B;

A short background: unexplained repeat pregnancy losses, chromosomal abnormality (TFMR), cp, mc, and then ectopic, normalish blood work and SA (slightly high FSH 10.8, slightly low AMH 1.6, AFC 23, normal other levels). 1st round IVF antagonist with 300iu Gonal F, 300iu Menopur and cetrotide added day 7, stimmed for 9 days, triggered day 10 with dual trigger. 12R, 10F, 8M, one made it to day 7 but was really poor quality. I think they all made it to day 3, but then arrested between 3-7, one made it to day 7 but I was told it was really poor quality and was thrown out. Nothing else was given to me regarding egg quality. 

The RE has me switching to a microdose lupron protocol with twice daily 300iu Gonal F, and lupron to be started cycle day 2 with a HCG trigger, estrogen patch priming started day 21 of my cycle. I ovulated late in this cycle, day 17ish, but still started the patch day 21. 

&#x200B;

Here are my questions for the RE:

 1. Why am I on such a high dose of Gonal-F (300iu BID)? I can not find information on this high of a dose, and I do not think I qualify as a ""poor responder"". From what I have found, it appears there is no benefit in a higher dose, because even if it yields a higher number of eggs, they are not necessarily going to be good quality. Have you found this to be true? I am willing to do a lower dose for a lower egg yield if there is a chance they will be higher quality.   


2. I know we discussed HGH dosing and how the jury is out on the benefit, but would you ever be willing to prescribe injectable HGH for the stimulation duration? From what I have seen, the risks are minimal for a short duration and there is a possibility of a benefit.   


3. My progesterone was lower this round when I started the Estrogen patch (6 this time, and about 11 last time), I am a little concerned this will have a negative effect on my cycle. Do you have any input?   


4. Do you have any input on why I am no longer taking Menopur with this cycle? I can not see my LH for my last cycle, is it checked throughout the duration when my estrogen and progesterone are checked?  

&#x200B;

Do you have any input as to more questions I should be asking? I am looking up things like crazy, I know it is the luck of the draw but I want to be as armed as I can be with questions and information before just jumping into another cycle.

This is just the [Hunger Games (egg retreival)](https://old.reddit.com/r/infertility/wiki/index#wiki_results_and_data) data:

616 cycles entered, 237 were added the first month the sheet was active (Mar 2018). On average a new cycle is added every day.  Cycle dates go all the way back to Jan 2014! The average member has contributed 1.3 cycles (MIN: 1, MAX: 6).  Average age is 25.5 (MIN: 15, MAX: 44, MEDIAN: 33, MODE: 33) and four of you were too shy to tell ;)

Now on to the cycles:

69% of the cycles were antagonist protocols and the other big 27% was made up pretty equally of Estrogen Priming + Antagonist, Flare, and Long Lupron.  Only 9 mini-IVF and natural IVF cycles.

The diagnosis bit is complicated since we allow for multiple selections.  There were 877 diagnosis selections.  58 of you say you are unexplained, but also selected another diagnoses.  Five of you said you weren't infertile at all, but were diagnosed as unexplained.  One of you said you were diagnosed as DOR, but you don't know what your diagnosis is.  The top four diagnoses were: Male factor (26%), Unexplained (24%), DOR (15%), and Ovulation Disorders (inc. PCOS) (12%).  The remaining diagnosis make up 23% and are less than 100 entries each.

7% used donor sperm, and only 1% used donor eggs.  397 of you provided your AMH and it averaged 4.3ng/mL.

411 of you provided your AFC and the average was 17.5 follicles (MIN: 3, MAX: 100, MEDIAN: 14, MODE 20).

7% of cycles were cancelled.  HCG trigger is most common at 59% with Lupron making up 22%, and Dual the remaining 19%.

72% of cycles used ICSI, with alternatives (like mixed) making up 4%.  The remaining were either not ICSI or didn't report.

Only 33% of cycles were planned as fresh, 59% were planned to freeze, and 8% reported getting converted from a planned fresh transfer to a frozen cycle.

Average stim days is 10.8 (MIN: 5, MAX: 32, MEDIAN: 11, MODE: 10).  Peak E2 levels were 7090 on average (MIN: 98, MAX: 673,540, MEDIAN: 2514, MODE: 4000), but only about half of you reported your E2 values.

On average, 15.4 eggs were retrieved (MIN: 1, MAX: 63, MEDIAN: 13, MODE: 12).  8,764 total for all reported!!  If you assume one egg per cycle that's 730 years worth of TTC.  Maturity rates are 75% on average and 83% of those that are mature will fertilize on average.

35 cycles only went to Day 3, but 380 cycles reported a Day 3 value.  Of the cycles with a Day 3 value, 87% of fertilized made it to Day 3.  345 cycles had a Day 3 and a Day 5+ value, of those, 61% made it from Day 3 to Day 5+ for a total drop from fertilized to Day 5+ of 53%.  518 cycles went to Day 5+ and on average 52% made it from fertilized to Day 5+.  83% of Day 5+ made it to freeze.  243 cycles went on to do PGS testing and the average normal rate was 54%.  Only 54 cycles had the ability to identify mosaics and found 12% mosaic, 43% normal, and 45% abnormal on average.

My partner and I just finished our first cycle of IVF after TTC for 3 years.  We had 24 eggs collected of which 14 fertilized.  Of these only 3 have made it to day 6. While I do feel grateful that we have even 3 embryos, my doctor has said that based on my age (38) we should expect at least 50% of the embryos to be nonviable anyway (we declined PGS mostly due to extra expense).

&#x200B;

I guess I'm just surprised that only 3 out of 24 made it this far. I can't remember the exact percentages my doctor quoted us, but can you think of any reasons why only 3 grew?  I was told I had the appearance of PCOS on ultrasound and hormone profile but I've never had any symptoms. And so far all our other tests have been normal, (HSG, semen analysis, genetics). I think my AMH was 2.5

We've done various testing to this point (HSG, SA) and they just took another 5 viles of blood today to cover our bases (AMH, TSH, etc.). Quick history, I've had 3 early losses, January 2018 natural MC, July 2018 CP, December 2018 MMC. None of these pregnancies were sent in for testing, because I kept being told that it was so unlikely it would happen again.

Pretty much the RE said assuming all of the additional blood work comes back normal she'd recommend us continuing to try naturally, since we seem to be able to get pregnant. She thinks that IUI would not be helpful in our case, so the only other thing would be IVF but doesn't feel like we are there yet. I also have very regular periods, so doesn't seem to think I need any hormonal testing done. 

I realize she is a doctor and knows what she is talking about, people do have successful pregnancies after miscarriage. I still have a 60% chance my next pregnancy will be successful. I understand the numbers and I understand what everyone is trying to say but I feel like everyone keeps telling me go get pregnant again, have another miscarriage and then we can talk. It's the same thing I heard after the first MC. Obviously that's not what anyone is actually saying, but I am so scared of getting pregnant again and having another loss. I don't know how many more times I can go through this and I understand IVF is no walk in the park, but I hate the idea of not doing anything but expecting a different result. 

So my question is when did you decide to switch to IVF?

<p>I realize she is a doctor and knows what she is talking about, people do have successful pregnancies after miscarriage. I still have a 60% chance my next pregnancy will be successful. I understand the numbers and I understand what everyone is trying to say but I feel like everyone keeps telling me go get pregnant again, have another miscarriage and then we can talk. It&#39;s the same thing I heard after the first MC. Obviously that&#39;s not what anyone is actually saying, but I am so scared of getting pregnant again and having another loss. I don&#39;t know how many more times I can go through this and I understand IVF is no walk in the park, but I hate the idea of not doing anything but expecting a different result. </p>

<p>So my question is when did you decide to switch to IVF? </p>

<p>Also worth mentioning, my husbands company offers really great infertility coverage. So the cost to us would be little to nothing. I know how lucky I am to have this coverage, which makes me so much more mindful I have to use it wisely.</p>

89,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband have been TTC for 2 years.  When we first started, we were amazed to find out we got pregnant right away - I was 37 and he was 42.  I’d been really anxious about our chances since I was over 37, but I guess we were some of the lucky ones?

Turns out my joy was short lived,  my water broke and I miscarried at 14 weeks.  Needless to say, we were devastated.  After a period of healing, we got back to trying again without success.  Now we are just winding up our first IVF cycle and things are not looking great.  We just got 1 embryo out of 14 eggs collected, which I just had transferred.  I’m having a hard time feeling optimistic, and dreading another cycle.  

The thing is, with my first MC, everything had been fine -there was a heartbeat, our genetic screening came back fine.  We made it past the critical 12 week mark, or so I thought.  I did, however, contract the flu and was sick for over a week just prior to miscarriage.  I’d had a flu shot that year but it wasn’t effective.  I tried to manage my temperature with ibuprofen, but at one time I remember measuring 102 degrees.  

My doctors have said that the flu had no bearing on the MC, that it was probably genetic factors.  But I have a hard time shaking this feeling that it was the flu.  And when I think that, the baby I lost feels more real to me, like if somehow I could have not gotten sick I’d be a mother now.  Or that it was the last good egg I had and now I won’t be able to conceive.  

I know it’s irrational, but it’s the truth.  I don’t know how to shake that feeling, and I’m having a hard time staying positive.  I fight with my husband about little things.  I also resent him for wanting to wait so long before trying.  We have been together since I was 33, and in spite of me sharing my concerns about aging and infertility, he was reluctant to try until recently.  I’ll be 39 soon and feeling like time is running out.  

How do I get over this sadness and move on?  I need to find ways to forgive myself and my husband, and to face the future with a positive attitude.

<p>Turns out my joy was short lived,  my water broke and I miscarried at 14 weeks.  Needless to say, we were devastated.  After a period of healing, we got back to trying again without success.

<p>The thing is, with my first MC, everything had been fine -there was a heartbeat, our genetic screening came back fine.  We made it past the critical 12 week mark, or so I thought.

So I’m actually a nurse working in a fertility clinic. Two weeks ago, I had one of the nurses I work with do an ultrasound on me to see what my ovaries looked like. They were super small with a low AFC. I spoke with one of the doctors I work with, and he told me to check my AMH. This morning it came back as 0.634, and I’m in shock. I’m only 25 years old, not married (in a new relationship, however) and do not plan on having children for at least a few more years. 

I have been on birth control pills for 10 years, and have been taking them continuously for the last couple of years, only allowing myself to get a period every few months or so. I know birth control use can have an affect, but I don’t think it would have THAT much of an affect. 

I’m going to schedule a consult with one of the doctors I work with and see what they say. I know they’ll recommend egg freezing, but financially that just isn’t an option for me right now. 

It feels weird going from working in the field, to now potentially needing to be a patient myself in the future. I have a whole new view,  now that I can actually relate to struggling women. 

I guess I just need to vent. I’m not that upset about it, at least not yet. I’m still in shock. Has anyone else experienced DOR/premature ovarian failure in their 20s?

Prior to my first round of IVF, my partner and I were mostly unexplained and had four years and four IUIs under our belt with no success. Leading up, our RE recommended half regular IVF fertilization and half ICSI (a general recommendation for unexplained cases). After egg collection, we opted to do ICSI with 6 eggs and regular IVF with the other 10 (as the sperm sample was deemed to be good) as per the recommendation of our embryologist. 

However, the next day we learned that none of our 10 regular IVF eggs had fertilized and only two of the ICSI eggs fertilized (one made it to day 5 and was frozen). This was really devastating, but I knew from the experiences of so many here that the first IVF round is largely diagnostic. I also read a lot of stories about low or no fertilization on the daily thread, but there was not a ton of information on the sub as to why this happens. 

I figured I would try to put together an extended post on things to read and consider for other people who find themselves in my shoes and search this sub for answers. As a caveat: this post just provides some brief information and really the best person to talk to is your RE. Also, please add corrections and/or other information missed.

**Okay, first things first: What is fertilization?**

There is a whole science on the stages of fertilization that you can geek out on. See here: http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/humandev/2004/Chapt1-Fertilization.pdf 

This chart, while more technical, also visualizes the different stages (study 3)

[https://imgur.com/pktXOpS](https://imgur.com/pktXOpS)

&#x200B;

**How often does fertilization fail?**

All eggs have a 30-40% chance of fertilization failure and thus all people undergoing IVF will likely have some eggs (hopefully a small number) that do not fertilize (study 1). Note, in ICSI eggs still fail to fertilize 20-30% of the time (study 5).

Keep in mind that each individual IVF cycle has a small number of eggs and it is difficult to determine if you are below or above average in terms of fertilization rates. For example, if someone only has 50% of their eggs fertilize (4 out of 8), this could signal a fertilization issue or could just be an “unlucky roll of the dice” or a “bad” cycle (as my RE put it). A small number of eggs means this percentage can swing widely.   

However, total failed fertilization (i.e., no eggs fertilize) is generally not considered to be an unlucky roll of the dice if there are a decent number of eggs and the eggs and sperm appear fine. Total failed fertilization occurs in 5-10% of regular IVF cycles and 2-3% of ICSI cycles (although some studies suggest higher rates). Among those people for whom this happens, the likelihood of failed fertilization recurrence in subsequent IVF cycles is approximately 30% (study 1). It is impossible, at this point, to predict failed/low fertilization prior to IVF.

&#x200B;

**How and why does low/failed fertilization happen?**

Low/failed fertilization may result from defective/insufficient sperm, defective/insufficient eggs, or deficiencies/toxicities in the sperm/egg medium (study 1). Prior to the widespread use of ICSI, REs would often order a hamster/mouse egg penetration test that would assess if sperm could enter hamster/mouse eggs in order to understand if the fertilization problem was due to a sperm or egg issue. Because ICSI overcomes egg penetration issues, this test is now rarely done. 

In regular IVF fertilization: failed fertilization often relates to the sperm-zona pellucida interface (study 1). In lay terms, the sperm never makes it into the egg. Here is a list of studies that find varying percentages of this taking place (study 1):

[https://imgur.com/JJcW8QR](https://imgur.com/JJcW8QR) 

In regular IVF, sperm parameters on the day of egg retrieval are associated with fertilization (study 7). Sperm with low concentration and progressive motility are more likely to have low fertilization (concentration below 40 million/ml, total progressive motility less than 50%, or both). Egg quality could also be a factor and an embryologist may be able to see factors that suggest this in the appearance of the egg.  

For ICSI there are several possible reasons for low/failed fertilization: A lack of egg activation, pronuclei apposition defects, and arrest in the embryo's first mitotic division. In up to 50% of cases, failed ICSI fertilization is due to damaged DNA in the sperm or the egg (study 1). A sperm DNA fragmentation test can help to diagnose this possibility for the sperm, although low DNA fragmentation does not completely rule out the potential for the sperm to be the cause of failed fertilization. For example, there are known but rare genetic issues in sperm that can only be diagnosed from extracted DNA (study 3).

For both regular IVF and ICSI: a low number of retrieved eggs and a low number of mature eggs are associated with low/no fertilization (study 9) – again, the unlikely roll of the dice is more likely when there are few eggs to fertilize. For this reason, diminished ovarian reserve is a risk factor for fertilization failure (study 6). 

There are also a lot of other more detailed reasons for failed fertilization. This chart, although technical, goes over the reasons for failed fertilization both before and after the sperm enters an egg (study 3): 

[https://imgur.com/CmjrggO](https://imgur.com/CmjrggO)

&#x200B;

**What can be done after low/failed fertilization during the cycle?**

In the case of an IVF cycle without ICSI, rescue ICSI can be performed. Early rescue ICSI (4–6 hours after initial insemination) generally has much better outcomes (basically the same as the regular ICSI group) than late rescue ICSI (approximately 20 hours after initial insemination) (Study 2). Clinics may not, however, check eggs in time to perform early rescue ICSI. \**A worthwhile question to ask a clinic prior to IVF (without ICSI) is if they perform rescue ICSI and if yes when****.*** 

&#x200B;

**What to do after a cycle with failed/low fertilization?**

First discuss with your RE any notes made by the embryologist. Certain factors (i.e., activation issues) can be improved by different lab procedures (e.g., chemical activation) in both regular IVF and ICSI. Also, diagnostic tests (e.g., sperm DNA frag) may help guide the next steps. 

If the failed/low fertilization cycle was a regular IVF cycle (and especially if sperm penetration was the main issue), another cycle with ICSI is likely to improve the outcome (study 10). If there is a history of any successful fertilization, some studies do recommend regular IVF can be just as successful as ICSI in subsequent treatment cycles in terms of overall outcomes (study 11). If the failed cycle was an ICSI cycle, diagnosing cellular defects may be the next step (study 5), using assessed activation (study 13), or using donor eggs/sperm/embryo (study 15). 

Fertilization failure in one cycle does not preclude successful fertilization in another cycle (study 11); in fact, after people are more likely to have some fertilization in the next cycle than not. However, studies show that various outcomes (e.g., birth rates) are generally worse compared to IVF patients with no fertilization issues undergoing subsequent cycles. Studies comparing outcomes between these two groups vary in many respects (e.g., ICSI only, number of cycles measured). But study 12 writes: In the short term “36% of the TFF \[total fertilization failure\] patients and 58% in the control group obtained ultrasound verified pregnancy … With long-term follow-up (between 2.5 to 13 years) 50% of the TFF patients succeeded in a live birth, which was significantly lower than the 70% in the controls.”

Prognosis may be better with increasing the total number of retrieved and mature eggs (study 6 and 12). In the words of study 10: “The consistent finding was that the number of mature follicles, number of oocytes, and number of mature oocytes was always statistically significantly lower in the total fertilization failure cycle when compared with fertilization cycles that occurred either before or after, whether with ICSI or conventional IVF.”

Other than ICSI, it is tricky to know what protocol is best because low/failed fertilization is associated with a low number of eggs retrieved and DOR. Thus, some studied suggest increasing gonadotropins to increase the number of eggs retrieved (Study 12)—however, this is not helpful for those who had low/no fertilization with a higher number of eggs. Also, most studies control for protocol type and find no association with low/no fertilization once other factors are considered. However, improving the number of mature eggs through careful timing could help. 

There is a lot of new research on the genetic conditions behind failed/low fertilization (study 8). These tests are new and many are only available in a research capacity at this point. For this reason, I try to remind myself that there may be factors that are totally outside my control. Although being healthy is a good all-around life goal, there was nothing that I could find that suggests fertilization can be “fixed” with lifestyle changes (although I recognize that the literature tends to be focused on medical interventions). For example, one study found that fertilization failure was not associated with age (once the number of eggs retrieved was factored it) or duration of infertility – although a women smoking was associated with higher rates of fertilization failure (study 12).

I’d love to hear more from other people who experienced low/no fertilization and specifically what their REs recommended as the next step.

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on r/infertility.

119,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All. I am beginning my 2nd round of IVF. Last time I was on birth control pills for 5-6 weeks before going off the pills and then beginning all my injections. Eventually had the retrieval, transfer with everything ending in an 8 week loss. 

This time my doctor had said that we would do the same protocol, however, we recently found out she is leaving the practice which super sucks. I had my baseline ultrasound today to see if everything was okay to proceed and got the green light. However, I was told they would like me to stay on the birth control only 3 weeks this time and then do the same injection protocol.  I did ask the nurse about the change and she said that they wanted to see if I’d respond differently to the shorter amount of time and it was the soonest they had. She also gave me the option to do a longer time on birth control if I would like. 

I guess I’m a little concerned about the change. My old doctor is still at the practice, but is leaving shortly. I’m sort of nervous that they are just trying to cram me in because they will be short a doctor soon and it is just a scheduling thing and not an in my best interest thing. On the other hand I also am not sure what the purpose of the birth control is to begin with or if it matters the length of time I’m on it.  So I guess my questions are:
1) what purpose does the birth control serve in this process and will the shorter time on it matter?
2) if I’m on the birth control for exactly 3 weeks then going off it will coincide with me getting a period as normal. Will that impact my ivf chances? Last time I did not bleed after going on the pill and/or between starting injections.
3) what would you do? I’m just so nervous about everything and I hate bombarding them with questions because I don’t want to be annoying but I guess I need reassurance or clarifications.

I have had one failed IVF. 12 eggs, only 2 fertilised and they were abnormal and failed on day 2. I am so disappointed. 

Next time we’ll do ICSI but I’m afraid they will be poor quality embryos again. I’ve started with improved vitamins (including COQ10) and cutting out sugar but would like to do more. 

I don’t take a lot of carbs / gluten. It’s mainly porridge and brown bread. I’m not coeliac, I’ve been tested.
However, lots of people seem to cut out dairy. Is this worth doing? I hear people say it causes inflammation but I don’t think it affects me. I would really miss cheese and milk but of course will do it if it’s meant to be the best thing.

Also, I put on 8 kilos during IVF. I’m working on losing it but it’s slow. I hate that I have a bigger belly and no baby. Doc will change my protocol next time round so I shouldn’t gain more weight but he’s advised me to lose this weight.

Recap : Trying since May 2015. Naturally conceived January 2016. MMC at 10 weeks in March. March 2018 we had our egg retrieval (22 retrieved, 17 fertilized, 12 made it and we now currently have 9 left). March 2018 fresh transfer - positive HcG but only for one day. June 2018 - FET. Positive HcG -- this time we made it two weeks. FET#3 - March 1st 2019. Positive HcG and this time we got to 6 weeks before MC.  Every test under the sun has been done and we pass with flying colors. Karyotypes come back a-ok. We are the classic definition of ""unexplained"". We're both healthy and seemingly have nothing working against us. The only negative we have is that I'm a carrier for NEB-related Nemaline Myopathy - but that doesn't really relate to our inability to get pregnant. 

&#x200B;

This is where my thought process is as of now with our 4th FET coming up and our pass/fail rate as it is. We clearly have something janky going on genetically. My lining has never been an issue and I've been on more Progesterone/Estrogen than I'm sure is safe long-term. We seemingly can't get pregnant on our own again as the last time that happened was over three years ago. BUT, we can get knocked up when we have transfers...subsequently every ""success"" seems to end in the same way, with the same kind of outcome. 

&#x200B;

Is there anything I should be suggesting to our RE? Any less common tests that maybe we missed along the way? The only ""solution"" we have right now is that maybe we should transfer 2 next go around instead of the usual 1. Clearly, something is amiss and odds are not in our favor that we transfer 2 and both happen to be healthy. We screwed up with not having PGS done last year -- we had no reason to assume that this would become our issue. Right now each transfer is roughly $3,500 and PGS is $1,700...so I guess we still have that option, but it seems way more risky now than it did then. Plus, money, ya know?

&#x200B;

I run through this shit every other minute of every single day trying to find a reason ""why""....I'm a fixer, and my inability to even come close to fixing this is driving my effing bat-shit crazy. Help?

Yesterday we recieved a mail from an American sperm bank that they do not ship donor sperms to S.Korea. To our knowledge the said company had shipped to Korea at least once in the last two years. This was the final straw in our long arduous journey of infertility. We are both 39 and we have been trying to conceive for the last seven years. We have had 5 IVF cycles and because of male factor two operations to retrieve sperms. After multiple failures we had first pregnancy at the end of 2018 but our baby stopped growing at 4 weeks so we had to perform D&C procedure. This left my wife so depressed that she stopped talking to other members of the family except me and her parents. We decided that there is no point in trying again with the amorphous sperms recovered from my second operation. Use of donor sperms for treatment is complicated in Korea because their strong sense of identity, this affects policies and by extension the foreigners residing in Korea. We finally got permission from our fertility doctor and started contacting companies in the US with Indian donor sperms. There is not such facilities in India because of cultural and technological issues. A company agreed that they can ship to Korea and they even put our selected donors sperms on hold. Then began the wait, we waited more than two weeks after their confirmation it can be shipped. My wife grew very desperate and started contacting them. She sent her mails and chatted to the company representatives. Initially we were told that the delay was unusual. Yesterday they sent a one line reply that they can no longer ship to Korea.

I am a few weeks out from my first failed FET that resulted in a CP, my third loss overall. During the WTF debriefing with my RE, she discussed performing an endometrial biopsy to look for evidence of the herpes HHV-6 virus. 

The clinic has been implementing this test as part of recurrent loss panels, and their findings are that infertile women do have the activated viral cells in their endometrial tissue, potentially causing a toxic environment and miscarriage. 100% of humans are exposed to HHV-6, with two different strains of active and inactive forms of the virus. It’s similar to the EBV and a vast majority of people with MS also test positive for the virus as well. Apparently, the treatment would be with an anti-viral medication prior to another embryo transfer. 

I’m scheduled for a biopsy on CD21, and I’m wondering if this counts as an endometrial “scratch”? My RE is extremely reluctant to do an ERA or standard scratch, despite me pushing for both. I’ve read about successful cycles after the scratch. Would this have a similar effect? 

I’m also wondering if my husband should be given an anti-viral before his semen collection, because he has MS which was likely activated as a child due to exposure to EBV. I can almost guarantee both he and I will test positive for HHV-6. 

Has anyone else been tested for HHV-6? Or had anti-viral added to transfer protocol? 



UPDATE:
My RE had me in the office today for a repeat diagnostic H-scope to look for polyps. I had several removed a few months ago, yet more have grown back. 

[internally screaming]

RE theorizes that IF I do have HHV, the virus may be triggering recurring polyp growth. I can attest that with PCOS 20+ years, polyps have been a constant issue and now it’s definitely interfering with my embryos. 

So, another round of surgery to remove the polyps. Has anyone been successful in shrinking them without surgery??? Or have other theories as to why these damn things grow back?

Oh, back to the HHV....if positive, then daily antivirals are required before retrieval through transfer and into first trimester if successful. I can’t even think what the fetal implications would be. 

RE is also interested in testing my husband, given his MSdx, and treating him with antivirals, along with me. [Pending an ok from his neuro.] She’s just as fascinated as I am by this connection. A virus responsible for all of it, for both of us? 

I’m off to pubmed to read up on this shit.

<p>I’m scheduled for a biopsy on CD21, and I’m wondering if this counts as an endometrial “scratch”? My RE is extremely reluctant to do an ERA or standard scratch, despite me pushing for both. I’ve read about successful cycles after the scratch. Would this have a similar effect? </p>

<p>I’m also wondering if my husband should be given an anti-viral before his semen collection, because he has MS which was likely activated as a child due to exposure to EBV. I can almost guarantee both he and I will test positive for HHV-6. </p>

<p>Has anyone else been tested for HHV-6? Or had anti-viral added to transfer protocol? </p>

<p>UPDATE:
My RE had me in the office today for a repeat diagnostic H-scope to look for polyps. I had several removed a few months ago, yet more have grown back. </p>

<p>[internally screaming]</p>

<p>RE theorizes that IF I do have HHV, the virus may be triggering recurring polyp growth. I can attest that with PCOS 20+ years, polyps have been a constant issue and now it’s definitely interfering with my embryos. </p>

<p>So, another round of surgery to remove the polyps. Has anyone been successful in shrinking them without surgery??? Or have other theories as to why these damn things grow back?</p>

<p>Oh, back to the HHV....if positive, then daily antivirals are required before retrieval through transfer and into first trimester if successful. I can’t even think what the fetal implications would be. </p>

<p>RE is also interested in testing my husband, given his MSdx, and treating him with antivirals, along with me. [Pending an ok from his neuro.] She’s just as fascinated as I am by this connection. A virus responsible for all of it, for both of us? </p>

<p>I’m off to pubmed to read up on this shit. </p>

With this legislation, New York becomes the 10th state to require IVF coverage. Even with limitations and exclusions, in my opinion every step we take towards expanding coverage and getting infertility covered as a medically appropriate treatment to a real medical diagnoses is a step in the right direction.

Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success.

My husband and I started our journey to building a family in 2014, through struggles, fertility treatments, 2 early miscarriages, some bad adoption agency experiences, here we are in 2019 and we are no closer to starting a family and I am not a candidate for IVF.  It has been devastating on my physical and mental health, and we are years from affording adoption. 

Mother's Day has always been difficult the past few years, this year however it feels like that has been magnified because my much younger sister (11 years) will be a brand spanking new mom due to an unplanned pregnancy.   I am happy for her, but heartbroken for me.  I feel truly honored by the fact that my husband and I do get to be the godparents to my nephew, and that is something we will embrace, but it still doesn't fill the emptiness. 

I know that this year is going to be a celebration of my sister, rallying around my mom who has had a rough year with the loss of her father, and celebrating my aunt a little harder as she just lost her husband.  We have had a lot of loss this year beyond my grandfather and uncle.  We have also lost a grandmother, my mom has lost some aunts and cousins as well, so I know the focus of this year will be the celebration of new. 

But I can't help but feeling like the person at the party invited out of obligation and that my role in my family is diminished because of my inability to have children.  I know I should be there to celebrate everyone, and let my mom know how loved she is, but my heart breaks at the thought of it because it is just so damn hard!   

I honestly want to disappear for that weekend, spending it either in a campground somewhere away from people or touring wineries where I know no one.  But then I feel guilty for wanting to run away.   The closer my sister's due date is and the closer Mother's day gets, the more stressed about it I get.

206,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"**TW: CP briefly mentioned**

So: my consult with RMA NJ went a lot better than expected. Like, a lot. I think because they have a similar (read: conservative) reputation to NYU, I was expecting more of the same, but I wanted to get a second set of eyes on my case, and I was able to get an appointment quickly because of a cancellation. So I figured, why not? 

For some background: I’m about to turn 30, but have been 29 at both retrievals. Relatively good health, I don't drink much, don't smoke, no drugs. Could stand to lose some weight after all these hormones, but nothing that would affect my cycles. I was first on an antagonist protocol, no priming, 300 Gonal F/150 Menopur, cancelled for a lead follicle and iffy recruitment; subsequent cycles were MDLF with estrogen priming, 300 Gonal F/150 Menopur. 

First successful ER (as in, made it to ER, not *“success”*): 15R, 13M, 11F, 2 blasts, both euploid, 1 BRCA positive (day 6 BB, but high fragmentation), 1 BRCA negative (day 7 BC, high fragmentation). 

Second ER: 23R, 19M, 14F, 4 blasts, 2 aneuploid, 2 euploid: of which 1 BRCA positive (day 6 BB, high fragmentation), 1 BRCA negative (day 6 BB, high fragmentation) — this blast became my CP. 

FET done at 110 hours; my ERA shows that it should be done at 134 +/- 3 hours. My FET and subsequent mock cycle show that I don’t absorb progesterone very well — it increased very very slowly, despite which, NYU didn’t start me at a higher dose from the beginning. 

I’ve done a lot of research myself, because trying to get any information from NYU is like pulling teeth. I’ve asked my RE what she’d do differently, and she’s said “nothing, we’d keep doing this,” which clearly isn’t working. I don’t accept that answer, and **surprise! The RMA RE confirmed basically everything I’ve been thinking this whole time**. 

The first thing she said is that I’m making pretty bad embryos (not a surprise to me, because when NYU sent me records, I discovered that every single embryo I’ve made has a high level of fragmentation — like, grade 3 of 4). And at my age…um, what the fuck? (I’m paraphrasing from the RE). She said right off the bat that it *could* be me, which they can’t do too much about (did ask later about HGH), or it could be the donor — which I’ve been wondering about, given a) his age vs mine and b) the fact that I have good maturity and fertilization, all good...and then everything goes to shit by day 5. That’s been pretty suspect to me, and at this point, we’re ready to go for it. I think in the past the idea would've stressed me out, but I *ain't got no fucks left to giiiiive*. 

Naturally mrslilacs and I have already found another donor we love, because we're both very tired of this bullshit. 

The second thing she asked me about was why the hell I was on a protocol for poor responders. She agrees that I was on a way wrong protocol, especially given the fact that I regularly get good hauls — and it’s not as common to see such poor quality embryos in someone who’s a good responder, and doesn’t have POF or DOR. Not to mention the fact that I definitely had OHSS at both retrievals (estrogen levels peaked at 3k and 5k, respectively) she was horrified that they dismissed my concerns and didn’t give me any cabergoline. 

She said she’d put me on estrogen priming, and then an antagonist protocol — possibly with a Lupron or combination trigger. The only reason she wouldn’t, however, is if the below about my FSH is still true; then I’d be on just HCG trigger; she was concerned about OHSS — but, been there, done that, have the burn on my face from being high on painkillers and eating Totino's ;)

She also asked me about my low FSH: when it was tested 2 years ago, it was 2.8; at the time, NYU told me that it didn’t really matter for the purposes of the cycle, perhaps my pituitary gland was depressed (I was new to this and naive). RMA RE wants to retest it, and my LH. She says if the two are both low, that indicates hypopituitarism — for the purposes of my cycle, that means I need to be taking more of an equal combination of the two (Menopur) than JUST FSH (Gonal F); whereas in the previous cycles, I’ve been on a higher dose of FSH than combo FSH/LH. I LITERALLY HAD A NOTE ABOUT THIS ON MY POST-IT NOTE OF SHIT TO CHECK OUT. She actually said that it would absolutely be compromising the quality. 

AHHHHHHHHH. 

That’s the sound of me screaming into the goddamn void because NYU has literally never brought any of this shit up and has straight up dismissed me whenever I try to suggest anything close to the above. 

What I find particularly interesting is that having low LH and FSH can be found with a luteal phase defect; my cycles are regular so it’s not something I’ve ever really considered. HOWEVER, I definitely have a progesterone problem, which can also be associated with LPD. She was really confused (that’s a nice way of putting it) as to why they didn’t up my progesterone more from the beginning (I start out at 1, then up to 1.5 about halfway through), given that I clearly wasn’t absorbing it at the rate I should’ve been (P4 was 12 at transfer, which I know is “high enough” but my RE wanted it at 15). I also asked about the ERA, and she did say she’d adjust the timing, but that she wouldn’t have done it before my transfer (bit of a ding, personally, but whatever). 

I did ask about HGH for quality, because she didn’t bring it up, and she said that while she can’t prescribe it to me, she had absolutely no problem with my using it ""if I can get some,"" which I can. She said they used to be able to, can’t anymore, but she’s seen it have great results (but has also seen it not make any improvement, which, so have I). But at least she didn’t outright dismiss me like NYU did. 

So then we finally go in and do an ultrasound to check out the ol’ ovaries. I let her know I have an ovarian cyst on my right side that’s been hanging out for a few years. She says, wow, GREAT lining (10.75), I say yep, never been my problem; she counts my follicles on the left (9) and on the right (8)…and then she gets to my cyst. And she’s like hmmm. We’re sure that’s a cyst? And I say well, that’s what they tell me. And she says, because honestly, it looks like it could be a dilated tube. 

WHUT.

She said I should have a repeat HSG before any transfer, because its appearance is long and tubelike, and any tubal issue would impact implantation; she says she’s not 100% sure, but a repeat HSG would certainly tell us more. I did have one two years ago before I started, but here’s the thing: my HSG was super fucking painful (which I know is normal for some people) — but during the HSG, I remember that my *right side was going way more slowly and that’s where the pain was coming from*. I told her this, and she confirmed that was definitely suspicious. The paperwork I got afterwards says nothing about that, because of course it doesn’t, but I remember it so well because I ASKED during the exam what the hell was going on — they told me my right tube was filling a lot more slowly and they were really having to push the fluid in, though it did eventually get through. 

AHHHHHHHH. Me, screaming into the void *again* because as soon as I saw the paperwork from my old HSG, I remembered this and wondered why it didn’t say ANYTHING about how painful and slowly the right tube filled. 

We then met with the nurse coordinator, who I liked a lot; they want me to redo day 3 blood work (got my period today!) and then they took some vials to redo some other blood work, including my AMH. Very curious to see what that is, as NYU never retested it.

So overall a very surprisingly good experience, including the fact that they set up a call with a financial person to go over everything, and have already pulled my insurance information to PRESENT me with it before the call. Oh, you mean that insurance information I’ve been fighting tooth and nail with NYU to have? Mmhmmm. The very same. 

I really wanted to get y’alls thoughts because you’re the smartest people I know. **Is there anything I’m missing?** My consult with CNY is tomorrow morning, and I had meant to do a WWYD/Case Study, but this appointment turned out to be much more than I expected (plus my blood work is so out of date that it’d be missing a big chunk of information). ",t2_1dtjl6m4,False,,0,False,thethoughtoflilacs' RMA NJ Consult Summary/WWYD?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_b7o17k,False,dark,0.96,,public,24,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},Treatment Advice,False,24,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1554069553.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong>TW: CP briefly mentioned</strong></p>

<p>For some background: I’m about to turn 30, but have been 29 at both retrievals. Relatively good health, I don&#39;t drink much, don&#39;t smoke, no drugs. Could stand to lose some weight after all these hormones, but nothing that would affect my cycles. I was first on an antagonist protocol, no priming, 300 Gonal F/150 Menopur, cancelled for a lead follicle and iffy recruitment; subsequent cycles were MDLF with estrogen priming, 300 Gonal F/150 Menopur. </p>

<p>First successful ER (as in, made it to ER, not <em>“success”</em>): 15R, 13M, 11F, 2 blasts, both euploid, 1 BRCA positive (day 6 BB, but high fragmentation), 1 BRCA negative (day 7 BC, high fragmentation). </p>

<p>Second ER: 23R, 19M, 14F, 4 blasts, 2 aneuploid, 2 euploid: of which 1 BRCA positive (day 6 BB, high fragmentation), 1 BRCA negative (day 6 BB, high fragmentation) — this blast became my CP. </p>

<p>FET done at 110 hours; my ERA shows that it should be done at 134 +/- 3 hours. My FET and subsequent mock cycle show that I don’t absorb progesterone very well — it increased very very slowly, despite which, NYU didn’t start me at a higher dose from the beginning. </p>

<p>I’ve done a lot of research myself, because trying to get any information from NYU is like pulling teeth. I’ve asked my RE what she’d do differently, and she’s said “nothing, we’d keep doing this,” which clearly isn’t working. I don’t accept that answer, and <strong>surprise! The RMA RE confirmed basically everything I’ve been thinking this whole time</strong>. </p>

<p>The first thing she said is that I’m making pretty bad embryos (not a surprise to me, because when NYU sent me records, I discovered that every single embryo I’ve made has a high level of fragmentation — like, grade 3 of 4). And at my age…um, what the fuck? (I’m paraphrasing from the RE). She said right off the bat that it <em>could</em> be me, which they can’t do too much about (did ask later about HGH), or it could be the donor — which I’ve been wondering about, given a) his age vs mine and b) the fact that I have good maturity and fertilization, all good...and then everything goes to shit by day 5. That’s been pretty suspect to me, and at this point, we’re ready to go for it. I think in the past the idea would&#39;ve stressed me out, but I <em>ain&#39;t got no fucks left to giiiiive</em>. </p>

<p>Naturally mrslilacs and I have already found another donor we love, because we&#39;re both very tired of this bullshit. </p>

<p>The second thing she asked me about was why the hell I was on a protocol for poor responders. She agrees that I was on a way wrong protocol, especially given the fact that I regularly get good hauls — and it’s not as common to see such poor quality embryos in someone who’s a good responder, and doesn’t have POF or DOR. Not to mention the fact that I definitely had OHSS at both retrievals (estrogen levels peaked at 3k and 5k, respectively) she was horrified that they dismissed my concerns and didn’t give me any cabergoline. </p>

<p>She said she’d put me on estrogen priming, and then an antagonist protocol — possibly with a Lupron or combination trigger. The only reason she wouldn’t, however, is if the below about my FSH is still true; then I’d be on just HCG trigger; she was concerned about OHSS — but, been there, done that, have the burn on my face from being high on painkillers and eating Totino&#39;s ;)</p>

<p>She also asked me about my low FSH: when it was tested 2 years ago, it was 2.8; at the time, NYU told me that it didn’t really matter for the purposes of the cycle, perhaps my pituitary gland was depressed (I was new to this and naive). RMA RE wants to retest it, and my LH. She says if the two are both low, that indicates hypopituitarism — for the purposes of my cycle, that means I need to be taking more of an equal combination of the two (Menopur) than JUST FSH (Gonal F); whereas in the previous cycles, I’ve been on a higher dose of FSH than combo FSH/LH. I LITERALLY HAD A NOTE ABOUT THIS ON MY POST-IT NOTE OF SHIT TO CHECK OUT. She actually said that it would absolutely be compromising the quality. </p>

<p>AHHHHHHHHH. </p>

<p>That’s the sound of me screaming into the goddamn void because NYU has literally never brought any of this shit up and has straight up dismissed me whenever I try to suggest anything close to the above. </p>

<p>What I find particularly interesting is that having low LH and FSH can be found with a luteal phase defect; my cycles are regular so it’s not something I’ve ever really considered. HOWEVER, I definitely have a progesterone problem, which can also be associated with LPD. She was really confused (that’s a nice way of putting it) as to why they didn’t up my progesterone more from the beginning (I start out at 1, then up to 1.5 about halfway through), given that I clearly wasn’t absorbing it at the rate I should’ve been (P4 was 12 at transfer, which I know is “high enough” but my RE wanted it at 15). I also asked about the ERA, and she did say she’d adjust the timing, but that she wouldn’t have done it before my transfer (bit of a ding, personally, but whatever). </p>

<p>I did ask about HGH for quality, because she didn’t bring it up, and she said that while she can’t prescribe it to me, she had absolutely no problem with my using it &quot;if I can get some,&quot; which I can. She said they used to be able to, can’t anymore, but she’s seen it have great results (but has also seen it not make any improvement, which, so have I). But at least she didn’t outright dismiss me like NYU did. </p>

<p>So then we finally go in and do an ultrasound to check out the ol’ ovaries. I let her know I have an ovarian cyst on my right side that’s been hanging out for a few years. She says, wow, GREAT lining (10.75), I say yep, never been my problem; she counts my follicles on the left (9) and on the right (8)…and then she gets to my cyst. And she’s like hmmm. We’re sure that’s a cyst? And I say well, that’s what they tell me. And she says, because honestly, it looks like it could be a dilated tube. </p>

<p>WHUT.</p>

<p>She said I should have a repeat HSG before any transfer, because its appearance is long and tubelike, and any tubal issue would impact implantation; she says she’s not 100% sure, but a repeat HSG would certainly tell us more. I did have one two years ago before I started, but here’s the thing: my HSG was super fucking painful (which I know is normal for some people) — but during the HSG, I remember that my <em>right side was going way more slowly and that’s where the pain was coming from</em>. I told her this, and she confirmed that was definitely suspicious. The paperwork I got afterwards says nothing about that, because of course it doesn’t, but I remember it so well because I ASKED during the exam what the hell was going on — they told me my right tube was filling a lot more slowly and they were really having to push the fluid in, though it did eventually get through. </p>

<p>AHHHHHHHH. Me, screaming into the void <em>again</em> because as soon as I saw the paperwork from my old HSG, I remembered this and wondered why it didn’t say ANYTHING about how painful and slowly the right tube filled. </p>

<p>We then met with the nurse coordinator, who I liked a lot; they want me to redo day 3 blood work (got my period today!) and then they took some vials to redo some other blood work, including my AMH. Very curious to see what that is, as NYU never retested it.</p>

<p>So overall a very surprisingly good experience, including the fact that they set up a call with a financial person to go over everything, and have already pulled my insurance information to PRESENT me with it before the call. Oh, you mean that insurance information I’ve been fighting tooth and nail with NYU to have? Mmhmmm. The very same. </p>

<p>I really wanted to get y’alls thoughts because you’re the smartest people I know. <strong>Is there anything I’m missing?</strong> My consult with CNY is tomorrow morning, and I had meant to do a WWYD/Case Study, but this appointment turned out to be much more than I expected (plus my blood work is so out of date that it’d be missing a big chunk of information). </p>

This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs.

This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

I'm 29. I have PCO and my partner has less than one million sperm, all deformed but with good DNA after a DNA fragmentation test. 

The first time, we did an antagonist protocol with ICSI.  I ended up with 6 mature eggs out of 11 and only two fertilized. One made it to day 5 but didn't implant after transfer and one died on day four. 

It was government funded. So, while it hurt, financially, we were OK. 

This time, we went with the same doctor who gave us a different protocol (long-lupron) and wanted to see my egg status himself before doing the trigger. 

Well, I got the bad news today. Out of 12 eggs, only 7 matured. Out of 7, only two fertilized. This was ISCI. 

It's almost the same as last time except actually slightly worse because out of 7, only 6. 

I don't know why I got my hopes up! 

Tomorrow, I'll find out if the two are still alive. 

I don't know if they're prematurely harvesting me or if it's an egg quality issue. 

I feel devastated and out of $11,000. 

Has anyone else had two cycles with such a low count? If it's an egg quality issue, what can be done when it's with ICSI?

I had a laparoscopy with ablation in 12/2017. I have endometrioma’s in both ovaries and pin point spots on my uterus. My Hysteroscopy came back clear. They removed several adhesions from my Fallopian tubes and ovaries. 

We had our first IVF cycle in 05/2018 and got 9M, 8F and  4 embryos. We had 2 failed FET’s, the first (08/2018) with one embryo and the second (09/2018) with two embryos. I had a intralipid infusion and PRP treatment for FET #2.  At that point our RE suggested we do another egg retrieval and go for blasts. I started DHEA after the second failed  FET. 

I just had my second egg retrieval today and we had 15 eggs. I’m not feeling as confidant this time and am struggling with next steps.

The protocol i've been on both times is 300 gonal f, 300 menopur, and cetrotide starting on day 5 or so. Triggered on day 9 or 10 both times. Been on the coq10 and DHEA regime going on three months now (wasn't on it for first ER because of crappy communication from my crappy ex-RE)

&#x200B;

My questions are as follows:

1. has anyone had a significantly worse egg or quality yield on HGH?
2. how many vials did you go through for the cycle? my nurse said i would start the hgh along with the other stimms and end it with them, so presumably 10 days being conservative given my past history. do you have a sense of whether i'd be going through more than 2 vials or can dosage be pretty variable?
3. what were the side effects? i don't even eat meat anymore, in part to avoid HGH beef cus it sounds skeevy to me, and now i may be putting it in my veins (lol). Is there any research i need to be reading about possible long term (or short term) effects?

&#x200B;

any feedback or insight would welcome. thanks y'all

We’re about to start an IVF cycle with an embryo donor & I got a price quote for $900 from 2 different pharmacies.

I went into GoodRX and compared the non compounded medicines (specifically 60 units of heparin & 120 tablets of estrace) and found that my local pharmacy had them for SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than what the fertility pharmacies were charging.

It would’ve cost me about $400 for those 2 prescriptions originally.

It’s only costing me $15 through Publix. FIFTEEN. (Which is even cheaper than the GoodRX coupon. I think they ran them through my insurance too.)

I was supposed to get a call yesterday from the doctor's office, so we could talk next steps, based on the results of the HSG.  They never called.  

I called the office today to ask whether I should be receiving a phone call from the doctor/nurse or whether I should just make an appointment.

>Receptionist: Dr. MissingInAction is no longer with us.

Say WHAT?!    

>Me:  Excuse me?

I wanted to introduce myself and get some wisdom.  Me (29) and my husband (33) have been trying over a year with no luck.  We have done all the basic tests. His sperm had some bacteria  and morphology  issues -2%-and mobility  was -30%- but count was more than 100 MIL and urologist said he's fine and a year is not long anyways (his words,  I was annoyed but whatever). Basically told us his numbers are the best he's seen. He prescribed him antibiotics and some supplements. 

My tests are good,  still need day 21 test but ultrasound and cd3 tests are perfect. Had 25 follicles  and hormones all in range.  

However,  I have a concern about reoccurring yeast infections. Each month I get a yeast infection after ovulation,  but what im worried about is how I react to sperm. Basically after sex,  there's an unpleasant smell.  I tried everything over the year.: Probiotics, only wear cotton,  no softer,  no eating sugar,  sleep no underwear, nothing seems to work...

My question is, is it worth testing  for CM problems or should I skip to IUI? I live is European country where doctors are not so aggressive (I'm American so it's much different Medical culture for me). 

Any suggestions or similar stories are appreciated

My partner is 38, 18 years remission from Hodgkin’s. He’s on meds for thyroid, cholesterol, high blood pressure (his treatment was mostly throat/upper chest areas so some damage was done in radiation). His first SA was less then stellar at a 16.7 concentration, 4% morphology but all heads. Second came back 80.5 concentration so MUCH better. Same 4%. Everything else perfect. Third, to break the tie, was 60 million concentration, 150.1 million total and a 2% morphology, again all heads. His T level was 302 and some of the supporting labs showed low levels as well, so he’s starting Clomid MWF and testing in 6 weeks.

I have a history of cysts, and PID, and I have had more wands in my vagina then most women who don’t have infertility issues. So I was prepared going into this. I was presenting peri-menopausal a few years back but the symptoms abated and I was hopeful I would have a few eggs left. I have been told by EVERY SINGLE doctor I expressed concern to that “it should be fine.”

Y’all. It is *not* **fine.**

I turn 38 on Sunday. My FSH was 26 this cycle. My AMH was 0.13. Follicle count was 4. I have *both* MTHFR genes.

My lovely RE was **shocked** and frankly so was I. She is… concerned my insurance won’t even cover one round of IVF (I live in Mass, where fertility is required coverage and switched to good insurance that’s MUCH more so I could do all this). *If* next cycles FSH comes back below 20, she is hopefully she can convince the insurance to let me try one cycle, and she told me she will be aggressive and we have to understand we may only get 1-2 eggs.

She explained, as well, that delays will mean higher FSH & lower AMH. She was great & honest that our spontaneous conception rate at this point is 1-2%, so we’re just going to go for it. At least we don’t have to deal with condoms.

We were given info about donor eggs. I’m totally open to that, but a bit crushed because everyone had gotten my hopes up with their constant assurances. My husband is amazing and took me for coffee and a Target wander to sooth me.

I’m absolutely not sure how I feel. I don’t expect to for a while. Therapy Friday should be interesting. I’m mostly overwhelmed. I am super grateful for everyone here being supportive and sharing as it has helped me prepare for possible issues and needing a donor.

274,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Earlier this week, I had my follow-up with the reproductive immunologist (RI) recommended by my RPL specialist. Since there are always a lot of questions about RI, and not a lot of current information, I figured I'd start a stand-alone thread instead of taking it to the dailies.

&#x200B;

When we met the RPL specialist in October, he recommended the RI. There are about 4-5 that everyone talks about, but this is the one who he recommended. My previous RE, who I still consult for second opinions, noted that they don't support RI because the science isn't there yet, said that they've successfully worked with one in the San Francisco Bay Area. We were scheduled for a consult back in December, but decided to reschedule it and see if another FET worked. It didn't, so we set up a new appointment in the beginning of March.

&#x200B;

The initial consult was about two hours, and he went over my health history. From an initial view, I had some of the markers of PCOS, but not high levels enough for an official diagnosis. He ordered a re-do of those tests, as well as a two-hour glucose, and expanded thrombophilia and autoimmune panels. He ordered a new sperm DNA fragmentation test for my husband, as well as a culture of semen to determine if there were any bacteria that might be causing problems. We also did a Gene Matching test. The follow-up was scheduled for three weeks later.

&#x200B;

The follow-up was a little over an hour, and he spent about 10 minutes reviewing my history (more for him than for me, since I know my reproductive history by heart). Then the next 30 minutes was going over the new lab results, and the final 30 was developing the protocol. He did a great job of explaining WHY he was recommending these things and not just prescribing them. The best thing he said was, ""it's never unexplained. It's only unexplained because no one's tested for the right thing."" At the same time, you can spend a lot of time and money grabbing at straws that may not give you what you want.

&#x200B;

Several sources said that he would find SOMETHING autoimmune to treat, and that was totally the case. I don't have a copy of the test results, but I've asked for one so I can provide exactly what was tested and how my levels actually fit into the ranges. What he described for the most part was not a surprise for those who have read about RI--Lovenox, prednisone, intralipids, and an antihistamine protocol. He's recommending IVIG for me, which I am skeptical about because of the cost (a minimum of $3,000 and since the FDA doesn't cover it for infertility, we're on our own), and there doesn't seem to be a lot of proof that it works. He definitively diagnosed me with PCOS, and I'll be taking Metformin for that. I have a family history of diabetes and a borderline A1C level so I suspected that Metformin would be in my future at some point.

&#x200B;

So right now, I'm still torn. With the exception of the IVIG, the medications are affordable and/or over the counter and there are minimal side effects. Most of what he recommended I'm either already taking (Vitamin D, prenatal) or have in the past (baby aspirin, Claritin, probiotics, prednisone).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** **I went to a reproductive immunologist and got some potential answers as to why my husband and I can't easily spark or sustain a pregnancy. I'm still skeptical. If anyone would like, I can go into more detail about who I saw and who else I investigated before choosing this RI. Also cost, insurance, etc.**

284,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all,

I have mostly been milling about / lurking the still trying sub for about 8 months, tfab before that. I seem to be accumulating a list of acronyms after each doctor I have been to see. I’m feeling a bit lost and I’m wondering if anyone can see anything in here that I could ask about or help me put my puzzle together.

History on me:  TW

* Painful periods at 13 & 14 - went to doc for birth control to 'fix' that.
* Last Depo Provera birth control shot was March of 2017 at 22 years old.
* Cycles returned in December of 2017 & we immediately starting tracking & actively trying.
* Temping & tracking showed fairly irregular cycles & a short luteal phase.
* Pain with sex since stopping birth control. Figured that was just normal for me.
* Had a hemorrhagic cyst that burst in March/April 2018. And Another in July/August, also burst.
* Had a chemical pregnancy in May. Two positive home tests two days in a row followed by a beta less that 5.
* Partner's first semen analysis came back ""borderline"" (24hr hold)- 20.4 million/ml, 37% motility, 23% progressive motility, 3% morphology (kruger strict).
* Left hip pain starts. Thought I’d stretched a muscle out.
* My OBGYN suggested PCOS in September after ultrasound showed polycystic ovaries, charting showed irregularity, & testosterone came back high-ish. Other more minor symptoms include some acne & a small mustache. She sent me on to an RE that she recommended.
* RE consult went well - labs for me showed low Vit. D (fixed with prescription and currently daily supp.), still elevated testosterone, and nothing else out of the ordinary. Ordered an HSG & Saline sono. HSG showed open tubes (horribly painful). Saline sono showed no issues (even more painful than HSG - 10/10 pain).
* Partner's second SA was a little better (48hr hold) - 31 million/ML, 57% motility, 57% progressive, 2% morphology.
* Oct 2018 - RE recommends IUI with letrozole OR IVF and gave me stats for each. I asked about metformin, she said since I don’t have insulin resistance with my PCOS, it likely wouldn’t help me.
* Did Natera carrier screening test after RE gave us the option. I carry none of the things they tested for.
* Painful sex continues, hip pain worsens. Pain with bowel movements, especially around ovulation & periods has worsened.
* Decided to go to a local OBGYN office for IUI because they could do it for 225 plus meds with ultrasounds for $100 ea. RE wanted 1200 plus meds. So we figured it was worth a try at this new place, heard great things.
* First cycle at OBGYN - took letrozole CD 8-13 because first consult was CD 8 & they said since I hadn’t ovulated, I could still start. Ovulated on day 14 - too soon, missed opportunity for IUI, oral progesterone 7DPO onwards.
* 2nd cycle - Letrozole CD 3-7, estrogen gel CD 13-20 (to build lining?), IUI, PIO shot 7 DPO, oral progesterone DPO 3-11.
* Fertility nurse at this office recommends looking into a lap if IUI fails (it did).
* 3rd cycle - Letrozole CD 3-7, estrogen gel CD 13-20, No IUI (decided not worth the money), oral progesterone.
* Letrozole 2.5mg is working really well for me & produces nice follicles. Also brings ovulation to around day 13 or 14 rather that 18-25+.
* Consult with endo specialist about lap was last week. It was great and he spoke with me for over an hour & did a quick exam. Found him on Nancy’s Nook & read everything I could on his reviews & such. He recommended a lap to excise the possible endo (no ablation), flush tubes again, do an endometrial scratch, check for interstitial cystitis & adenomyosis, & remove appendix. Suspects bowel involvement due to pain with bowel movements and he is doing an ultrasound with bowel prep in June to be as prepared as possible before the surgery.
* Surgery scheduled for October, hoping to move up the waitlist. Put me on Metformin, told me to not use Letrozole for a few cycles to see how the Metformin goes by itself. Also asked me to do a class about charting cervical mucus next weekend…? Ok, can do.
* Lastly - he tested me for the MTHFR mutation and I am positive for compound heterozygous MTHFR C677T. Cue - what do I do with this info.
* I’ve been on low dose aspirin for 6 months anyway - will continue this. Ordered methylated folate today. 1mg/day.
* Continuing - regular prenatal, B complex, myo-inositol, & C0Q10 ubiquinol. Adding B6 slow release at his suggestion as well.

So now I've got all these acronyms and I don’t know if there’s a bigger picture that I’m missing. How important is this MTHFR thing? Should I have any other tests done in conclusion with that? (I read something about homocysteine) Does any of this connect to each other (PCOS - Endo - MTHFR - Short luteal phase without progesterone support - thin lining - etc etc).

I just don’t know who to ask this to either. The RE that I currently can’t afford and haven’t had anything done with in months? The OBGYN clinic who was really only doing my IUI’s? This new OBGYN/endo specialist who I’ll see again before surgery? I just wish I could put this all together somehow.

If you have read through all of this - thank you. If you have any suggestions on what I can ask next, please feel free to let me know. I feel lost, but also like I have a lot of information - just need to organize it.

I wanted to preface with some backstory information - We started trying about 3-years ago and got pregnant right off the bat. Close to 10 weeks she had a miscarriage which resulted into a D&C operation. Current tests show no scaring of her uterus but every since she's been very irregular with her cycles ranging from 23-37 days. We did a 6 month round of clomid with no luck, we've done blood work, HSG tests, additional hormone test, and I've done tests as well, everything is working as it should.  

 So we just did our first round of IVF and received the dreaded phone call yesterday that her HCG levels were close to 1 which means a negative. She's torn up but not all hope is lost, we have (2)  fertilized that are in a cryo state. 

I think we are going to take a step back and refocus our efforts - She's been a stress ball, full of anxiety and sleepless mess throughout this process over the past 3 years, she's 31 and thinks time has passed her by.

I guess it's time to make a brief introduction. Me (33 almost 34F) and my husband (45M) are in our 15th (or 16th?) cycle of trying to conceive. I have had success without medical intervention from a previous marriage.

My gynecologist referred us to an RE after ten months of nothing but stark white HPTs. I was tracking with OPKs and temps and it appears I am ovulating on my own. It was found that my husband had low motility and my tests came back favorable. My RE has us on a natural IUI protocol but still injecting ovidrel after measuring follicles. He didn't seem at all concerned about my AMH but it was 1.2. I know I'm not 22 anymore but that seemed a bit low for my age. My question is should I be asking for a medicated IUI? Our first failed even though my husband had a pretty good count (\~15 million post-wash). I know three IUI's is the magic number and I don't want to go through another three rounds of medicated IUI before we are finally (and possibly inevitably) referred to IVF.

So this past weekend I finally flew to Florida to see my brother, SIL and their child which is now a year and 3 months old. The last time I saw them, I was pregnant with my soon-to-be third loss. Right after that loss, they told me they were expecting. They then had the child a couple days after I learned I'd have to use donor eggs (3 failed IVF cycles later). To say the whole thing has been painful is obviously an understatement. He is my only brother, younger brother too, and he didn't even know his wife yet when husband and I started trying.

I've felt tremendous guilt about not seeing him or doing much to acknowledge his child (my therapist said it was totally fine, but still). It was also bothering my husband that we hadn't visited them (again, therapist said it was up to me to call the shots, but still). I would email brother every 6 months with another sad update on us, he's a sensitive person so he totally got it. Seeing as we are now in a holding pattern waiting for our cycle with our 2nd egg donor (ugh), I could see a possibility of us flying out for like, a day, to see the child.

I was a bit of a wreck leading up to it and afraid to feel that crushing pain (we've seen BIL + SIL's child 3 times now and each time it was like I was dying and my heart was being pulled out of my chest). The good news is this time it felt different, not the crushing grief. I held it together and didn't bawl or clam up like a weirdo, I was able to be almost normal. Just like a very sad quiet version of myself. This time it was more of like a stomach ache of bottomless longing. She was really beautiful. I didn't touch her or hold her. I felt an overwhelming urge to steal her and make her mine. She has more of my biology than any future children I have, if I'm even lucky enough to have any. It was just so fucking heartbreaking. SIL mentioned husband and I are the only aunt and uncle (didn't realize that, what a fucking gut punch), although I can't come to terms with that title for myself. Feels like a terrible consolation prize of being a mother. Hopefully one day that will change.

We kept to our plan for visiting windows which made the trip much more manageable, I was able to run on the beach with husband twice which was good for our souls. Now I'm back at work and just really sad and empty. I'm glad we did it, we needed to do it.

Welcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. 

Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.

**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.

For a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).

**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top ""Read This"" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies. Of course, you are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences (and continue to support other community members) here on r/infertility.

<p>Maybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren&#39;t ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren&#39;t rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.</p>

<p><strong>If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&amp;C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.</strong> Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive Beta database, check out <a href=""http://www.betabase.info/"">http://www.betabase.info/</a> for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).</p>

My two cycles after the 2nd IVF had loads of spotting and light bleeding 10 days before the actual period started. It’s been very cruel as the timing was exactly right for me to think ‘this is implantation bleeding!’  Well it was not. The cycles seem to get shorter (19 days) as well.

I actually work in healthcare, in pediatrics, so gyn is not my expertise, but my OB (who I see at work) treats me more like a colleague than a patient, which warps things in our conversations. If I asked her for clomid, she would give it to me, and I'm just not sure if I should or not go for it at this point. She mentioned it, and seemed surprised when I said I didn't want to do it just yet. Perspectives appreciated!! :)

I got diagnosed as a teen with what i call PCOS lite. Horrible, heavy, painful irregular periods, absolutely horrific acne, hair growth, just awful. Cysts were never found, but my labs were super out of whack (all I remember now was that my testosterone was approaching 200 - my endocrinologist was horrified) and I got through the next decade or so with OCPs (which did nothing for my symptoms whatsoever, but made me lose hair) and then finally a combination of 1500mg metformin and 100mg aldactone which made a huge difference and helped with all my problems.

My body seems to have regulated itself out at least a little bit over the years. For a variety of reasons (mostly GI related - TMI) I basically stopped taking the metformin a few years ago. I still mostly got my periods every 35-45 days but I have never been able to confirm that I actually successfully ovulate.

We've been TTC for a few months now. I've been on metformin again (1000mg, still unpleasant but tolerable) and got surprisingly normal labs. FSH 3.5, LH 5.something, testosterone was only about 55, etc. I've been peeing on ovulation sticks for a couple months now and still haven't gotten a clear positive result, even though i have gotten my usual irregular periods. I see so called changes in cervical position and mucous and opening that sort of correlate with expected hormonal changes during a cycle - but also never have had clear EWCM (egg white cervical mucus) either. We have sex basically every two days, and no dice. I don't know what to do! My ob would give me clomid if I asked, but I dont know if I should wait longer, and due to various life circumstances (which my ob is also aware of and totally understands) it is sort of important that I do get pregnant in the next six months, or i would have to stop trying all together for about a year.

I had my second IUI yesterday. My first IUI was a piece of cake. No issues whatsoever.

During the procedure yesterday, I knew something was wrong. When she injected the semen through the catheter, I immediately saw stars.

She cleaned up and told me to lay there, and she started talking to my SO. I started sweating and the pain was rising fairly quickly. I felt short of breath and nauseous. I told the nurse, something isn’t right, I feel like I’m gonna vomit or faint. 

It did not feel like normal cramps; it felt like my uterus was being pulled in half.

She sat me up and gave me Tylenol, and suddenly my pain was 10/10. I felt like I was giving birth. My uterus was contracting so badly I couldn’t focus and I felt blacked out.  I said to my SO, something isn’t right , I’m not okay. I can’t move. I’m gonna pass out.

The entire clinic came in. My BP was 165/101. My heart rate was 133. I was in and out of being able to see straight. My pain felt worse than 10/10. It felt like a vise was twisting my insides. My oxygen level tanked. I jus kept saying “stop fucking talking to me, I can’t focus, don’t touch me.” I was dripping in sweat, my teeth were chattering, and my legs were twitching so badly I couldn’t feel them. 

It was 15 minutes in that my doctor made a comment that sometimes the sperm isn’t washed correctly, and then you risk placing a SHIT LOAD of prostaglandins directly into the uterus. He said it’s incredibly rare. But here we were.

Prostaglandin suppositories are given to women to induce labor. PGs are found in semen, but when you have normal sex, by the time it’s reached your insides, your body has leveled it out so that the PGs don’t wreak havoc.

So basically, the semen sample was chock full of prostaglandins, and caused me massive uterine contractions. I have endometriosis and I can honestly say I have never experienced pain at this level. I feel incredibly traumatized. 

A nurse gave me an IM shot in my ass, of Toradol, which suppresses PG activity, and after 45 minutes I was okay again. 

I guess I just want to raise awareness because you never hear about this, and if anyone’s gone through this, you’re not alone. It was the worst experience of my life and I am now terrified to ever do IUI  again. 

Has anyone else had this? I know it’s so so rare, but maybe someone out there had this horrible experience, too. 

Edit: researching what happens if it isn’t washed, and apparently you can go in to shock and die. That’s fucking terrifying. I feel like I have legit PTSD.

337,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello I'm new here and hope someone see's this and wouldnt mind helping me out. We can call me S. I'm married to my husband going on 1 year in April of this year. Super happy and proud. We've been together for 2 years. I'm super happy and he's on board for having a baby. I convinced and showed him I really want to start a family so in July of 2018 I went off birth control.

My history 

So I had my first period December of 2012 (I was 13). It was not fun painful. Stopped school for a week to cope. My mom told me that it would we weird and not consistent for the first few years. I took that as two or 3. And in that time frame I had periods on and off. They were usually super painful and bring me to my knees. My irregular periods continued on and 9 times out of 10 were super painful. They always last 7 days and the first 3 to 4 were super heavy and so fucking painful. I would spend weekends cooped up my room crying not eating and trying to breathe through the pain. My parents did not give me pain medication so I toughed it out and dreaded it. By around 15 I was worried they weren't coming in right but mom said keep track of them and let's see what happens maybe you need more time. Okay so I did. Age of 16-17 I kept great track whenever I had them (lost the app data). And by 17 I was worried. So I got a check up at 17 by my pediatrician about my periods and finally spoke up. It had been about 5 years and nothing consistent. I could go 6 months without a period it was crazy. On and off no type or rhyme or reason or pattern, fully random. Dr. Pediattician (Dr. P) said okay well let's get you some blood work and an ultrasound. I'm up. I do both. Ultrasound comes back fine blood test show a bit of increase in testosterone and that was all. Dr. P suspect I might have PCOS and said let put you on birth control. Dad said no cuz I dont want you to have sex, that's to stop babies. I tried to explain it to him but he shut me down and that was the end of that. 5 months into dating my husband I see Dr. P at age 18 and ask for birth controls. She give to me and says take it on the first Sunday of last day or period (something like that). Husband and I stop using condoms around this time and use pull out method. Now when I met my husband in Jan i had my period 3 times in a 4 month time frame (till April). No period May. I'm chill. No period June. I think I'm  pregnant  take a test or two and negative. No period in July. Negative test again. August my period come randomly. Not pregnant and I was okay. I always wanted a family but was still a bit early in our relationship so it wasnt the right time. I get on birth control called Sprintec 

(Please note from the time a met my husband till now I've been gaini ng weight. My whole fault I'm lazy and love junk food. Went from 120 to 200 lbs in the span of about 1 1/2 to 2 years)

Now for the recent stuff. I took Sprintec from Aug 2017 till early July 2018. Almost 1 whole year. By this time me and hubby are married and we had decided to start trying. I have my last period on birth control and we start doing the dirty like crazy. I test lasted July and early August and lasted August and nothing and I'm waiting on a period. Nothing. So I'm confused. September rolls around and wont lie we lost steam. I've been worried about this for awhile I've always wanted my own family and I want lots of kids so I'm starting to freak. Over analysis of symptoms thinking in pregnant all the time. So finally my husband knows my history and goes just see my PCP ( primary care physican) or some MD if you're so worried. So I do. I make an appointment with an OBGYN. See this lady (Dr. Z) and I tell her my history she order a blood test suspects PCOS and tells me to eat better and that will solve all my problems. She also gives me a perception on progesterone (dont remember if it had a specific name) and says take this and take some prenatal vitamins as well. I have to get all my vitamins and minerals and keep my insulin in check. Stop all carbs and stay away from sugar line the plague. So I do and try hard. I stood bringing juice to work and drink water and I cut back a whole bunch of crap no more soda only 1 glass of homemade koolaid with 2 cups of sugars. I try damn hard to stop everything. She said no processed foods and try to change everything. The progesterone I take for 5 days then after stopping for about 9 days I get a period. OMG, I got one. So it comes and it's the weirdest period ever. I'm bleeding on and off it last about 6 days and just overall a mess. I bleed most in the beginning like the 1st 2 days the sputter the last days through. It even stopped for a day then started back up for a second and then finally is done. So Dr. Z says my blood work came back with not enough certain vitamins need more of some stuff. I cant remember I'm sorry but it wasn super unusal. She says then that I should get back on birth control fix my diet and try to get off of it when my diet is good and I'm working well. In upset. We are in late October, Early Novmeber and it's been some time (please note as well I'm inpatient so this I do blame on myself)  I didnt want to go back on birth control at all (still dont honesty how would that help me). I felt like she didnt listen to my past history and blamed everything on my weight gain. Which cant explain all my problems can it? What about my history of irregularities? I dropped Dr.Z. And in December 2018 I seen my husband PCP (Dr.V). He listened and seemed to agree it probably wasnt my weight. So he says let's order another ultrasound (from when I was 17 to check how things are) and I also asked for my testosterone checked and I belive he did my thyroid as well. So I get that done in Jan 2019. Ultrasound is normal again all clear and looks healthy. Blood work come back. Testosterone was normal levels. I had his cholesterol and something else and they told me cut back in fatty and fired foods (fair statement).  Also note at this time dark veins on my hips and back of leg began to show up. Thought they were vericose vein by Dr. V said no. I did note I had a lot of them and referred me to a endocrinologist. I dont have the time or money with me moving houses and will kiss my april 12th appointment but want to see the lady.

So finally! My questions!
What is causing my periods to stop and not happen? Us it PCOS? Could it really be my weight with my history? The progestrone is the only thing to give me period besides birth control should I try those creams? What is wrong with me? I'm 20 and idk why I cabrio even get a period. Like I need a place to start. Should I go straight for invitro and hormone treatment. Was my first obgyn right? Wilk my diet solve all my problems?? I want to start a family so bad and it sucks. I see all these young people my age or who had kids my age who had accident babies and the minute I really want one I cant. Why cant I have a baby? What's wrong with me. what have i done wrong in my life? Do i have endometriosis or uterine fibroids with the painful usually heavy periods?? Any help? advice? What would you do? I kinda just wanna go for it and do IVF and take the money lost and have the baby I want.
