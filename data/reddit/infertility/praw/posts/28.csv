But just because there was some ""sheer luck"" that I had never been pregnant. Also, wacky periods, a lot of hormonal-related issues, etc.

I came on here and I was pushed to run my own tests. And I did. And they were not good numbers. And then I was pushed for find a REAL RE. So for that, THANK YOU. You know who you are, and made a HUGE impact on my life and health.

I went to the RE on Tuesday. The clinic was generally a car sales shitshow, and he knew his shit, but didn't want to say it -- he wanted to make a profit off of tests and more and more visits. He said we had ""4-6 months to freeze my eggs"" but wouldn't explain how this affected my body. No real timeline or health-related diagnosis. I had to even ask, straight up, if my numbers were ""DOR"".

I ended up getting a 2nd opinion. This doctor was amazing. She spent an entire hour sitting with me and explaining why my high FSH and E2 weren't really that relevant because my AMH sucked so much. She gave me about a year to be able to conceive naturally -- or, in other words, hit menopause early.

Yes. The words I was looking for.

The flipside; I'm currently in perimenopause. She won't know a more exact timeline (no one ever does) until she does the AFC. My eggs, until I totally dry up, should all be good quality due to my age. AMH does NOT correlate with quality. It does, however, explain the irregular period, and why I may not be ovulating. 

And here's what made me angry at this experience; the previous RE wanted to run a ton of tests to find the ""reason"" like PCOS or a Thyroid issue. This doctor? Clear cut: when you run dry early, it's genetic. (Which is another road I'll have to head down.)

And so there it was, not just DOR -- POF. She had a recent Thyroid test and she said it actually looked really great.

So now I can stop chasing tests and focus on exactly what is happening. Though, to be honest, that's really hard to accept.

But again, thanks to those on this forum who kept pushing me to get the answers I wasn't getting. 2 weeks is a RAPID amount of time for all of this to happen...but I'm glad I know now. And I wish this was a more standard part of care for younger women, not just for fertility but for what our bodies go through that so many just won't be prepared for.

I was hoping you lovely ladies wouldn't mind sharing your stories (the good, bad and really ugly if you don't mind) of mood-related side effects you've experienced from IVF drugs.

I apparently don't 'tolerate' artificial hormones. This is what I've been told given I have tried taking just about every drug combination of the oral birth control pill and all of them, within a few weeks, leave me in a depressed mess. And I mean seriously depressed to the point of being unable to function and nearly suicidal. I have never suffered from depression otherwise, and within a few weeks of the birth control being out of my system, I'm back to my normal self. 

I consequently am terrified of IVF drugs. I've been told by doctors varying opinions from ""you will never tolerate them"" to ""they're completely different to birth control so you'll be fine"". I've completed 5 rounds of IUI but used no drugs except for HCG trigger in the last 2 rounds. I had a miscarriage after the fifth attempt and now am struggling with how to proceed. I know it may seem gutless compared to what so many of you have been through but I just can't risk putting myself through that level of drug-induced depression / other mood-related side effects, even for the baby I want so much. I'd consequently love to hear how you've all found them. 

(And a quick intro because I realised I've never really offered one despite posting a few times. I'll be 30 in a few weeks. Sick of waiting for Mr Right to come along so at the start of this year, made the biggest decision of my life to try to have a baby on my own. I have suspected mild endo and unexplained high DHEA levels but am otherwise healthy with regular cycles and ovulation. I was told I'd be pregnant within 3 months with donor IUI which clearly was the definition of being given false hope. Recent miscarriage after the fifth cycle which I took very hard and now I'm questioning everything and just don't know what to do anymore. Not sure whether to continue with IUI given eventually the getting pregnant part of it did work. Or progress to IVF despite the drug risk. And sometimes I even think about just not going back to the doctor at all and saving myself from all this heartache and the unbelievable fear of another miscarriage but the no baby component of that option is pretty scary too..).

I’ve been a long time lurker over at Tryingforababy and finally decided to make an account and become part of the reddit community since our trying to conceive journey has started a little sooner than I was expecting. I am 25 and my husband is 24, we were originally set to start sometime mid 2017. Because of the family history of testicular cancer and past varicocele surgery (6 years ago), my husband has been seeing an urologist. He has had periodic SA to make sure everything is in check. Earlier this year, my husband had a hernia repair and the urologist recommended that another SA test be done 6 months after to ensure everything was still within normal ranges. 


The results we have received from this past test are not great. The past test results haven’t been the best, however they were within normal ranges, just maybe on the lower side. My main concern is the morphology decrease (last test it was 6%). I’ve been doing some research, and it seems that a really low morphology can conflict with trying to conceive.

HEAD DEFECTS | 84.5 | 98.0
NECK DEFECTS | 2.5 | 0.0
TAIL DEFECTS | 6.5 | 1.0
NORMAL FORMS | 6.5 | 1.0

| DUPLICATE |    |
| CLUMPING | 0 | 
| ROUNDCELLS | 2-3 |
| VISCOSITY | 0 |
| DAYS OF ABST | 10 |


My husband has an appointment later in September for a check-up. Unfortunately, the nurse in the office said the doctor would not call my husband sooner to go over the results. These test results make me pretty anxious. I really do not want to wait that long, but it seems like we will have to play the waiting game a little longer. 


My question to y’all is, has anyone experienced similar results? What were the recommendations? We have not tried to conceive naturally and I am currently still on oral contraceptive. On the bright side, I am glad we know there is an issue early. I can’t imagine trying for a year and then going through testing to find out. 


I’m excited to be part of this supportive community! Thank you all.

Cysts. Tech told me one on each ovary (but she might have meant to say both ovaries were affected) and nurse says two on left and one on right. Their info sheet says they typically do two weeks of BC then check again for cysts. I guess with three rather large ones (should've gotten measurements) they decided to just bench me for a cycle. Which sucks because timing next month will be way worse than this month. I'm going out of town one week, my sister and mom will be in town a week later, and we've just got a full schedule in general.

Very Important Project kickoff meeting went great this morning, but things broke while I was in it so I've spent almost 4 hours fixing other people's mistakes. I can't believe it's only Wednesday.

Also, meds. I ordered my Gonal-F from ivfmeds.com because it was like half the price of Freedom. Great customer service and I highly recommend them. But you do have to wait for it to be shipped from the UK. So I ordered Friday and paid expedited shipping. That's an extra $50 over what it would've cost me if I'd known I'm waiting an extra month. And the tracking said expected delivery today, but they tried to deliver yesterday. Since they require a signature, they left a note saying they'd hold it at the post office. I went to pick it up at lunch and the post office employee was dumb as a box of rocks. He asked me for the slip 3 times (that I didn't have on me) and couldn't remember my name or address. He looked for *20 minutes* for this package and couldn't find it before giving up and letting his coworker look. Who found it immediately.

So I head to the pharmacy on my very late lunch break to pick up my letrozole. They don't have a record of the prescription. Weird, but whatever.. then as I'm walking away I hear her talking to a pharmacist and say my name. I turn back in case they need to talk to me. And I'm glad I did because it turns out there was confusion over my script and they had it on hold instead of filling it. Apparently the script they got said 10 pills, 2 pills twice a day for 5 days. That's 20 pills. So they called for clarification. And heard 1 pill twice a day for 5 days. So they fill that. I correct them (after waiting another 20 minutes for them to finally fill it) and they say insurance won't cover 10 pills. They'll cover 5, so I'd only have to pay $2.12. But if they try to give me 10 pills it'll cost $194. Their solution was to give me the 5 pills now and try to fill again for the other 5 tomorrow. If that doesn't work, I'll let them know that I don't need them for another month now...

After all that crap I decided to go to the bank and get a stack of ones. I'm going to the strip club tonight come hell or high water.

Edit: Forgot to mention the part about getting absolutely drenched in thunderstorms at lunch while running all these errands and the headache from not eating because I spent my entire lunch break getting medications and it doesn't matter since I wouldn't be able to force anything down right now anyway with as stressed as I am.

Instead of waking up from anesthesia to hear the expected HUGE number of eggs retrieved (expected ~25-30), I woke up to receive the news that 4-5 follicles were retrieved and there were no eggs in any of them.  
RE believes the Lupron trigger may not have worked, even though my LH and Progesterone were exactly where they should've been, and that I did not ovulate on time.  I was told to go home, inject my Ovidrel HCG trigger, and come back tomorrow morning so that we can try again.  WTF?!?  
Up until this failed ER, everything was right on track.  12 days of gonal-f, then ganirelix, then a Lupron trigger after my Estradiol spiked and a fear of OHSS, my bloodwork was always great and my ultrasounds showed 50+ follicles growing steadily, many 19-21mm pre-trigger.  
What the HELL happened?  Has anyone experienced this?  RE thinks this second trigger could do the trick and tomorrow's retrieval could produce all of the eggs we wanted!  However, he said if I happen to ovulate between now and then, we could also come out with ZERO and then I start this whole cycle over.  I'm pissed, I'm sad, I don't know how I will feel going into this procedure for the second time in 24 hours, but I will surely not be as excited as I was this morning :(.  

UPDATE: total fail, zero eggs.  OK, 2 immature, unusable something's.  He tried his hardest today but something didn't work... Didn't ovulate or just had empty follicles.  This is the best, most seasoned RE in town and he has never had this happen before.  He says we'll try harder next cycle.

I'm not a frequent contributor to this sub, but I see the support you give each other and I admire that. I feel I could use your insight and supper in this matter.  After three failed IUI's, my husband and I are taking the next step to IVF very soon (CD1 is quickly upon us).

For those that don't know, a bit of background...

I've had two laparoscopies; one (2006) for an ovarian cyst (this led to my endo dx), and the second (03/2016) was for removal of adhesions caused by stage 4 endo. HSG (01/2015) and hysteroscopy (03/2016) both showed clear tubes. Sonos show regular ovulation patterns, uterine lining growth, OPK positives, etc. Husband's numbers are phenomenal, and got better with each IUI. He's such a trooper!!

We tried to conceive for about a year on our own before my gyno referred us to an RE. Upon the first appt with our RE (whom we adore), we tried naturally four cycles. Took a couple months off prior to the surgery. After the second lap, we waited a cycle, tried naturally one cycle and went right into the IUIs. My fear is that even though the adhesions were removed, my tubes are still unable to grab my eggs. We tried IUI despite feeling IVF was our best chance, yet here we are anyway. 

Thanks to the lovely redditors of this sub and others like it, I have a rough idea of the physical timeline. We have typical standard, textbook questions. I am lucky enough to have a thorough understanding and appreciation for my situation. An early endo dx allowed me to educate myself years ago and know this is where my road would lead. We are fortunate to have amazing jobs with flexible schedules, and the funds to pursue this venture.

Originally the doctor wanted to do a frozen embryo transfer, but according to the calendar I’ll be doing fresh. When I emailed the IVF coordinator, she said it was because we chose not to do PGS that they decided we could attempt to do a fresh transfer.

I remember during our WTF appointment, part of the reason why he wanted to do frozen was because the success rates were higher. IVF coordinator says “they differ by a few percentage points, it really doesn’t matter but we can do frozen if you’d rather do that.”

I’m sorry, a few percentage points matter when I’m paying $20k+.

So I guess I’m just looking for opinions since I know a lot of you have done tons of research and are fairly knowledgable about it all. Right now with my preliminary research and gut feeling, I’m leaning toward doing a frozen transfer.

And I'm wondering if I should reconsider doing PGS. I'm 33, husband is 34. We are unexplained. I was born 2 months early (if that matters). My karyotypes have been tested, and all came back normal (though I don't know if that really has any relation to PGS needs).

As for IVF calendar: start stims on 9/7, possible ER 9/18 or 9/19, and (if we do) fresh transfer on 9/24 or 9/25.

This is my first IVF and I've had a bit of an ""interesting"" day today so I felt the urge to share it with you lovely people, on the off chance that this might help someone at some point. 

I've been suppressing for over 2 weeks now and was told by my clinic to call them if I had not started bleeding by Sunday. True to form (because my body doesn't like doing anything it's supposed to do!) nothing happened so I called the clinic when they opened Monday. They booked me in for a scan and blood test this morning. 

I was also told to take a pregnancy test in the morning, just in case the lack of period was for the very best news reason. See above for the fact that my body is a jerk, so needless to say the test was negative! 

When I got to the clinic they did an internal ultra sound and within seconds said they could see the problem. I'd developed a 4 cm cyst this month which was preventing me from bleeding and responding to drugs as expected. 

They explained I had a couple options: 1) wait and see if it went away on its own, which would delay treatment but was the simple course of action because cysts are fairly common and usually do sort themselves out (but might take a couple months); or 2) have the cyst aspirated (drained) today and (all being well) be able to delay treatment a week or so but be on course for this cycle. 

I decided to go for option 2. 

The procedure is fairly straightforward. It's the same as egg retrieval but you are awake for the process. You lay in the seat with your legs in the stirrups. They put a wad up first with an antiseptic type solution to clean where they will work. Then the pop an ultrasound wand up (but with no lube so it's more uncomfortable). Then for the worst bit. 

They then use a needle to pierce through the wall to the cyst and drain off the fluid inside. The piercing is the worst bit, I'm not going to lie, it hurts. I should've guessed when there was a nurse in the room who had the sole job of holding my hand and making sure I was ok!  

I was asked to cough ""a big strong cough"" and as I was doing so they broke through. Ouch. It wasn't really painful after that though, just uncomfortable. 

The draining only took a couple minutes. They filled four vials with fluid and showed me what it looked like. Basically it looks like a strong colour wee. Bit gross. I couldn't believe how much came out though. After it finished I had to cough again as the needle was removed but that wasn't as painful as going in. 

I then was slowly sat up ( to make sure I didn't feel faint) and got dressed and sat in a comfy room and was given a couple paracetamol. 

They then explained that my blood tests from earlier in the day showed the cyst had been producing oestrogen which is why I hadn't had a bleed yet. My levels were something like 3400 and after 2 weeks of suppression I should be under 100! So they expected with the cyst drained the oestrogen levels would drop over the next week and I should then bleed. I therefore continue on the same dosage of injectables for the next week. 

Had a little bit of bleeding post procedure (normal) and a little cramping but nothing too bad. Just got to wait and see now but hopefully my body stops being a dick and starts doing what it should now! Wish me luck!

If anyone else has had a cyst aspirated and gone on to stim I would be really interested to hear about your experiences too. 

In the meantime I'll keep injecting every day and see how we go.

Ran labs last week:
FSH: 10.0 mIU/mL 
LH: 5.7 mIU/mL 
ESTRADIOL: 72 pg/mL
AMH result: 0.54
....not ovulating, irregular cycles. 

So I finally saw the RE today. It wasn't quite what I expected...he bounced around a lot between my health history, my cycles, what my husband had to say and then my lab results (which he was SUPER impressed that I had ....so THANK YOU ALL for convincing me to get them!)

The breakdown of the hour with the doctor was a confirmation that I have DOR, though he seemed very hopeful about it.... at least in terms of ""oh, we can do more labs and scans to see what's really going on."" I was VERY clear that we wanted to understand our chances to have babies in 5ish years. He was also pushing us to freeze my eggs within the next 2-3 MONTHS. All of this was in a very hopeful attitude, but he did clarify that in a few years, I would be VERY unlikely to get pregnant. He also said he couldn't be sure if I'm ovulating with an irregular cycle, meaning I could get pregnant now, but I might not. And there is the egg quality issue.

There was also the SURPRISE! that they wanted many many many more labs and tests that my insurance doesn't cover (it doesn't cover fertility stuff at all.) Ultrasounds, follicle counts, tube analysis, egg analysis, and another batch of the CD3 and Clomid challenge too -- all during my next cycle. We're talking about $5k of work. 

HA.

My husband and I had agreed that if it's clear that this process would be financially and emotionally draining...especially for years...we just can not. Kids were an option for the future, but if its now or never, that future was just taken from us. So...we will deal.

Aside, the RE does want to do some work to figure out what's wrong with my cycle. He thinks PCOS or Hypothyrodism. Previous lab work has revealed possible hypothyrodism, and I have no symptoms of PCOS...even my labwork is opposite of it. I'm not sure I want to go down that road, as it seems to be a money grab fro this lab. I can run the TSH test myself. Did anyone here find PCOS despite no signs or numbers?

Link to original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4wvhks/cervix_bleeding_after_using_clomid_doctor_is/)

Today I finally got a call back about test results for the pap smear and chlamydia test. They where both negative as suspected(though I did worry about the pap smear). This means that there is no answer as to why I am spotting other then the fact that my cervix is inflamed and therefore bleeding.

So they are sending me in for a Colposcopy and if nothing is found they will preform a cauterization with silver nitrate to stop the bleeding. My doctor wasn't sure how long the waiting was for a colposcopy but she estimated 2-4 weeks, It has to be done at a different hospital/department(My RE is a hospital RE). I didn't pay attention to which hospital she had refered me to as I live in the capital and most likely it will be the one in central Copenhagen, so with morning traffic the drive might be 45 minutes top(normal 15-20 minutes).

Soooo if I'm lucky the Colposcopy will happen sometime in september and then by my CD 1 in start of October I will be starting IVF. This would mean there will have been no answer as to why I am bleeding and that is annoying. I would like some answers.... 

I am happy that the smear and chlamydia test are negative. Those are results, not answers unfortunately. :)

1. Having to comfort *them.* I know they're both disappointed and heartbroken right now, but it is not my job to help them through it.

2. Answering questions about when our next cycle is. We made the total newbie mistake of telling them when our transfer was. That immediately led to an endless stream of texts from MIL (a nurse) demanding to know the results of every single beta test and ultrasound. Next time around, if it works, we're waiting until I'm on the verge of showing to tell anyone.

3. Platitudes. I know you want to help, but don't tell me it'll ""work out next time"" or ""it'll happen when it's meant too"" because you don't know that.

4. Lectures and armchair medical advice. Don't tell me I need to stress less, or sleep more, or eat better, or take different vitamins next time or whatever else you read about in Oprah magazine. Again, you think you're helping, but what I hear is ""you probably did something wrong that made this happen"" I *know* that isn't true, but if I have to listen to it, I'll still end up saying something we'll both regret.

5. Voodoo hippy angel bullshit. MIL is religious and likes to talk about prayer and God's plan. My mother is a fan of psychics and of reading the first chapter of whatever mass-market New Age self-help book is currently in vogue and then playing amateur life coach to me and anyone else who'll listen (Turns out all my problems are the result of the ""negative energy"" I send out, who knew?)

70,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"We are in the middle of IVF #5.  We are, for the next 24-48 hours, in a peculiar and Kafkaesque situation -- and I am casting out this post in the hopes that someone else has been through this and can offer me some counsel.

In our prior IVF's we used different protocols but always got like 2-6 eggs, of variable quality.  The last two IVF's we got 2 quality blastocysts returned both times, they just didn't implant.

We are doing round #5 with a new RE, and HAVE TRAVELED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY (at great expense) to do it at a clinic where several couples we know had been successful.

Before I went under the anesthesia for the retrieval, the nurse asked me five times like: ""When did you take the trigger shot?""  I  did everything properly, at the time the doctor told me to take it.  I told her this 3 or 4 times.  (None of my prior REs have ever asked that question)

After I wake up from the retrieval, the RE tells us that all four follicles were empty.    o_O  Zero.  Zip.  

The RE (a dude) starts asking, ""When did you take the trigger shot? Did you take both shots?  Maybe you were too nervous to inject yourself with them?""

By this time I'm sobbing because I am pumped full of hormones and just came out of the OR and can no longer think clearly.  My husband is sitting there in a total state of shock and rage.

I mean, come on, this is not my first rodeo -- of course I f*$&#ing administered the trigger shots correctly.

The next words out of his mouth are, ""Well... given your AMH... you know... you are 37 but our ovaries are much older.  This is a scenario in which egg donation would be strongly recommended.  Let's talk in a few days.""

More sobbing.  

I run out of the clinic to sob on the lawn away from the other patients who are also having a tough day.  

The RE, of course, knows we are still booked in our hotel here for 10 more days, and have already spent an exorbitant amount of money, and so, in theory, he could unfreeze some donor eggs and we could ""salvage"" the cycle.  He would make several more thousand euros off us in the process.  That would be a real a win-win for the clinic -- this cycle would not be reported as ""unsuccessful"" in their statistics (which they must report to the EU).

This is the doctor who, not 6 weeks ago, said we could keep going with our own material as long as we wanted; we had not yet reached the ""donation or nothing"" point.

Has anyone gone through something like this, particularly in international IVF in the EU?

We are, for the next 24-48 hours, in a peculiar and Kafkaesque situation -- and I am casting out this post in the hopes that someone else has been through this and can offer me some counsel.</p>

<p>In our prior IVF&#39;s we used different protocols but always got like 2-6 eggs, of variable quality.  The last two IVF&#39;s we got 2 quality blastocysts returned both times, they just didn&#39;t implant.</p>

<p>We are doing round #5 with a new RE, and HAVE TRAVELED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY (at great expense) to do it at a clinic where several couples we know had been successful.</p>

<p>Before I went under the anesthesia for the retrieval, the nurse asked me five times like: &quot;When did you take the trigger shot?&quot;  I  did everything properly, at the time the doctor told me to take it.  I told her this 3 or 4 times.  (None of my prior REs have ever asked that question)</p>

<p>After I wake up from the retrieval, the RE tells us that all four follicles were empty.    o_O  Zero.  Zip.  </p>

<p>The RE (a dude) starts asking, &quot;When did you take the trigger shot? Did you take both shots?  Maybe you were too nervous to inject yourself with them?&quot;</p>

<p>By this time I&#39;m sobbing because I am pumped full of hormones and just came out of the OR and can no longer think clearly.  My husband is sitting there in a total state of shock and rage.</p>

<p>I mean, come on, this is not my first rodeo -- of course I f*$&amp;#ing administered the trigger shots correctly.</p>

<p>The next words out of his mouth are, &quot;Well... given your AMH... you know... you are 37 but our ovaries are much older.  This is a scenario in which egg donation would be strongly recommended.  Let&#39;s talk in a few days.&quot;</p>

<p>More sobbing.  </p>

<p>I run out of the clinic to sob on the lawn away from the other patients who are also having a tough day.  </p>

<p>The RE, of course, knows we are still booked in our hotel here for 10 more days, and have already spent an exorbitant amount of money, and so, in theory, he could unfreeze some donor eggs and we could &quot;salvage&quot; the cycle.  He would make several more thousand euros off us in the process.  That would be a real a win-win for the clinic -- this cycle would not be reported as &quot;unsuccessful&quot; in their statistics (which they must report to the EU).</p>

<p>This is the doctor who, not 6 weeks ago, said we could keep going with our own material as long as we wanted; we had not yet reached the &quot;donation or nothing&quot; point.</p>

<p>Has anyone gone through something like this, particularly in international IVF in the EU?</p>

1.  Any folks out there have experience with failed PGS-normal embryos? Was it just a matter of trying again or did you need additional treatments or tests to find out the root cause of the problem?

2. I want to do another embryo freezing cycle and my doctor is recommending doing a frozen embryo transfer at the same time with one of our 3 remaining embryos.

Thank you all.


Here's our history.

Me: 34 years old, probable egg quality issue, never had a positive pregnancy test, MTHFR homozygous C677T, family history of autoimmune problems
Husband: 35 years old, no known issues, no kids

Started trying to conceive in January 2015 and would like to have 2 children

Mother has history of 3 miscarriages, but managed to have 4 live births also (though for 2 pregnancies had to be on bed rest with progesterone injections)

I had luteal phase spotting, so we tried progesterone supplements for about 6 months in the second half of 2015. A hysteroscopy in 2015 found (and removed) a small septum.

I also have a retroverted (tipped) uterus though doctors say this probably isn't a problem.

I've been doing acupuncture for a year, including during the transfer. No idea if this is helping.

Husband's basic sperm assay was normal

In 2016 we started IVF to try to create embryos to use later for a second child

Embryo freezing cycle 1

* Menopur, Follistim, Ganirelix, HCG trigger
* 24 eggs collected
* 22 eggs mature, embryologist noted some eggs didn't look good - egg quality issue
* 14 fertilized with ICSI, significantly lower than expected
* 14 survived to day 3
* 8 survived to blast
* 5 had high enough grades to be biopsied
* 2 normal by PGS - this is lower than normal for my age (34)
* mild OHSS symptoms

Embryo freezing cycle 2

* long lupron protocol + Menopur, Follistim, HCG trigger
* 21 eggs collected, no quality issue noted this time
* 12 eggs mature, lower maturity rate than last time
* 10 fertilized with ICSI, fertilization rate was expected
* ? survived to day 3
* 2 survived to blast
* 2 normal by PGS

Transfer 1
* Estrogen patches, progesterone injections, aspirin, steroids
* 1 female PGS normal embryo
Transfer failed (success rate with PGS-normal embryo is 50-60%)

Just wanted to give you wonderful people a update on the WTF appointment.

Our REI RE spend more than an hour explaining things, and answering all our questions in details, she was really kind. 

But, she started plain blank saying that they always do a peer reviews of the complicated files (she said that our files if not complicated *per se*, as the issue is clearly the translocation). So, anyways, 8 RE discussed our files, results at different stages, and they all agree that they recommended IUI with donor. 

Husband said he was relief, as it was a clear ""Nope, not worth it to do another micro-tese and all"". 

So, we are waiting for the appointment with the geneticist, just to have a confirmation (now I'm a bit afraid she gonna tell him that statically there is x chance, but he said that after 8 REs agreed on the course of action, even if the geneticist say something different, he doubt he would want to try again). 

We also need to have an appointment with a psychologist to get vet for the utilization of donor gametes. 

Told husband to really think about it, that I was also ok with the option of letting it go, that we tried and it did not work. And he said that he would prefer donor to nothing at all.

But then, we'll see with the psychologist.

So, it was a bit of a relief. We also mention the possibility of a mixed IVF cycle, with a donor. RE said that of course, they do mixed IVF cycle, were half the eggs go to a donor. But they normally offer, in special case of massive MFI, it at the second IVF, after a failure of first IVF (we refused a back-up donor at that time, and we saw another RE to discuss the WTF of the first IVF and get the prescription to the second IVF, we saw the PGD dude that did not explain that option. He was not really good that guy to explain things, but anyways, husband was not there yet). But anyways, that in our case, she did not recommend that option, as it would reduce the chance of success, as giving the empirical data, donor only would be better. But that of course, the end decision is ours, and if we want to try whatever, she would help us.

I was so afraid of trying and failing again.
Ok, mind you, the IUIs might not work at all, but failing trying nothing new is less bad, somehow.

So, for more, need to redo a pap test, more bloodwork, and we wait for the geneticist appointment and the psychologist.

I'm so glad that we got to try with the micro-tese and all, tho.

So, will see how it goes.

Just wanted to say many thanks to all the lovely people here, you are such a lovely support system, and apart of our parents, you'll the only know knowing about it.

My situation is a bit complicated, because I'm being treated by both an out-of-state clinic and getting monitoring care by a local RE in Texas.  We initially began our care with the local doc, but transferred to Shady Grove in MD because it was way cheaper and we get better care. 

Today I go into my local RE's office for a follow-up ultrasound to find out if I'm having a miscarriage.  This is the first time I've even seen the doc since we transferred to SG. Mostly I've been dealing with her staff (her incompetent, incompetent staff).  Before even starting the ultrasound, while I'm lying there, twat in the air, she starts grilling me about why I changed to a different practice.  I'm like ""they were more affordable"" (also they're too professional to pull shit like this). Can we just get this show on the road please?

We find no heartbeat.  I'm now set to miscarry at 6 weeks. RE mentions I could do a D&C or just take Cytotec and do it at home. I opted for Cytotec. She writes me a scrip. I walk out through a swarm of pregnant women (their fucking office is *across the hall* from a giant OB practice) trying not to cry. 

I get home to a message from my SG RE telling me I need a D&C so they can do genetic testing on it, also because they're worried that a natural or Cytotec miscarriage might lead to scarring or a missed m/c.  I call back local RE at 1pm.  She's taken off for the weekend. Her nurse (who is clearly as dumb as a cabbage) is obdurate in insisting that they can't do genetic testing on a 6 week pregnancy.  Also the very earliest they could get me in is a week from now.  She says if miscarry something I recognize as a yolk sac (how would I know? Does she want me digging through the clots to find it?) I could keep it in the fridge over the weekend and bring it to them on Monday.  (Are you *kidding* me?)

I call SG to tell them this. My doctor there opines that local RE are being cunts because I'm not their patient and they don't want to deal with me because there's no real money in it for them (I'm paraphrasing).  She tells me she really doesn't want me doing a natural miscarriage and wants me to stay on hormones until Monday so we can get this sorted out (sure, why not just keep pumping myself full of hormones so I can hold onto this empty egg sac for another week? That's cool. I jut love being a walking mausoleum) She suggests I call ""my OB instead.""  Problem: *I DON'T HAVE AN OB.* I never needed one before.    

I call my PCP for a referral to an OB.  They give me one.  I call the OB.  Yeah, well, since I'm a new patient, they can't see me until the end of September.  I'm hysterically crying at this point. Sometimes that magically opens doors and cuts through red tape, but not this time.  It's now 4:30 on a Friday and good luck getting hold of anyone else. I get to wait until Monday.  

If this bullshit doesn't get resolved Monday, I suppose I can just drive my ass to Planned Parenthood and walk through all the pro-lifers with their fucking bloody fetus pictures so I can finally get this over with.  Or go to the ER maybe?  I don't know. 

For those of you who've been through this, what did you do?

UPDATE: finally got ahold of my primary RE and she gave me her blessing on stopping hormones and letting nature take its course. She also said she'd start making calls Monday to her Houston contacts so that I have someone on standby if I do end up needing a D&C for some reason.

We (36 and 37) have only been trying for just under a year, but I was right to start testing sooner rather than later as I suspected that something wasn't quite right. We did all the tests and my partner is basically good other than being borderline on the forward motility. As for me ... well a few things (the rest is in the 'normal' range):

1) HSG showed that I'm a unicorn. That means that only 1 of the two 'ducts' developed so I have only 1 kidney (which I've known since being an adolescent) but also only 1/2 of my uterus and also only 1 tube. So much for the gynes in the past saying that the reason for low flow and tampons sometimes appearing to only get blood on 1 side was just because I was on the pill and because of the way the tampon was placed.

2) very light periods combined with 'only 3mm thick' lining found during the pelvic ultrasound (which was done at CD11). They also found a cyst on one ovary. 

3) GP found mild hypothyroidism and after two months on meds the levels went up, not down as they are meant to... so I'm on double-dose now and waiting another week before getting tested again.

I'm now almost done with the 3 month wait to see an RE and starting to compile the list of questions for the Dr.
I think I have questions about issue #1 covered so for you ladies out there, any ideas of what could be causing #2 or #3? 

I thought the lining was meant to be ~10mm around CD10, so I guess 3mm is a bad sign. Anything I should look into or ask specifically about for that? I think that lining build-up is driven by oestrogen but my estradiol levels were fine on CD3.

How about cysts? From what I read they seem common and come and go (mostly go with BCP or time). Should I be worried? Anything I should ask about those?

Anyone else experience issues with TSH levels going up after starting to take medication? Mine is not 'bad' it's just a bit high for someone trying to get pregnant. I already switched from evening (as I was doing before) to first thing in the morning (but hoping my breakfast isn't interfering with the meds?)

Another question I have is regarding financing and timing in IVF: I'm trying to get my head around fresh vs frozen. We are thinking frozen because of PGS as I'm assuming it'll be a 1 embryo at a time deal because of the small uterus (which is going to be complicated enough with 1 foetus let alone 2) but is a FET basically twice the cost of IVF or is it basically just extra medication costs? Or somewhere in between? How about the timing? If you are doing   stims, retrieval, PGS (wait), FET, what time-scale would we be talking about to get to transfer? I don't know it it's 6 weeks or 3 months. We'll be paying for it because ...well... Canada (and not Ontario) so cost is also a concern.

I'm curious what you have been told the ""wait"" time is on proceeding with treatment post-travel. By that time, if our IUIs fail, we would be moving to IVF. When I went in for my IUI yesterday, they did ask me about travel, but I didn't think enough to ask more about it.

UPDATE:  Thank you all for your responses. We will see how the next few months play out. Thankfully, we have travel insurance, so I at least inquired with our travel agent as to what we would have to do should we need to cancel.

108,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"TL;DR:  I held a tiny hand and it broke me.

I've had trouble being around pregnant folks and babies for quite some time.  Going through this struggle just seems to breed resentment for infant lifeforms.  

I've never had issues with little kids, though, and found it hard to relate to y'all when you talk about it.  In my entire life, I have RARELY been exposed to small children.  I'm the youngest.  I wasn't around any Aunts or Uncles with kids.  It was just never a ""thing"" for me.  I've been around a few kids here and there, of course, and at best they've been cute, and at worst they've been unholy terrors that I didn't care to spend any time with.  Never a true emotional connection, though.  

Until yesterday.  My husband was getting his first acupuncture treatment (a 2 hour appointment), and I was sitting in the lobby alone, crocheting these awesome ear warmers that wrap around baseball caps.  There was no receptionist on duty, so it was just me and my hooking.  

A little blonde girl, maybe 3 or 4 years old, opens the interior door to the rooms and peeks out.  I smile and wave at her.  She darts back in, and I go back to my crocheting.  

About 3 minutes later, she comes out that door fast, heading for the front door to leave the office.  I'm still the only person there.  So, of course I toss my work off my lap and say in the nicest *I'm not a 'bad' stranger* voice, ""Hey Sweetie.  Can I help you with something?""  She starts crying and says ""I want my mommy!""  It's not an annoying cry.  It's a scared little girl cry.  

I tell her, ""Let's go see if we can find her, then.""  She looks up at me, and just puts her hand in the air for me to grab.  It was the sweetest, most innocent gesture.  Just, ""Okay, hold my hand and take me to my mommy.""

I went back into the therapy area and knocked on the door that I knew my husband was in (I didn't know what level of undress other people were in, and I knew Mr. Feetos wouldn't mind), and asked the therapist if she recognized the little girl.  We went to a few different rooms, and another therapist recognized her and said, ""Oh, your mommy just went to the bathroom.  Come on back in here and we'll wait for her.""

And it was over.  Just like that, the tiny little hand left mine.  She looked back and I waved to her, and went back to my crocheting.

The moment has been playing over and over in my head.  First, I'm grateful we had to reschedule this particular appointment to yesterday because of my IUI.  Otherwise nobody would have been in that lobby to catch her before she went outside.  

But mostly, I miss that tiny little cold hand in mine.  It was such a sweet, gentle moment.  I've never had a kid do that to me - ever.  I've never held a tiny little hand while we walked.  I just wanted to grab her up, stuff her in my car, and go home.  To heck with Mr. Feetos.  He could hail a cab!  (Not really, but I'm sure you understand).

So, anyway.  Here I am, sad and obsessing.  Maybe it's the hormones, or the TWW that I'm less than half-way through.  Either way, I totally get it now.

I have been trying to get pregnant for over 2 years now, to no avail (never even been pregnant, not even a miscarriage). I'm not that young anymore, so I have been starting to feel like it's never going to happen. I've already reached that stage where I'm jealous of pregnant people, and even looking at babies almost reduces me to tears.

As a result of all this, I have started IVF treatment. I only get my cycle every other month, so my IVF cycle process takes longer than it should. Also, my doctor said that I don't have good eggs, and the ones I do have are low in numbers. I'm afraid I'm going to go through menopause soon.

Fast forward to the past couple of weeks - my doctors cancelled my IVF because I didn't make enough eggs (despite all my injections). They switched it to an IUI (basically artificial insemination). I found out yesterday that my body didn't take, and I am not pregnant. I already knew due to getting my period, but it's still devastating.

However, plans are moving forward. I start my next round of IVF at the start of September. In the meantime, I have to have surgery to get a polyp removed next week (polyp may be affecting getting pregnant).

Even with all of this going on, my BIGGEST issue has been something stupid and petty. Even thinking about it makes me want to cry! My problem? Husband is inviting his best friend and pregnant fiancee to visit us (they are from way out of state). NEXT WEEK!

I JUST found out that I am not pregnant. I have to have surgery next week. I have to do all of this stuff to prepare of my next IVF protocol, and we have to entertain guest?! Work has been busy, my schedule has been switched around to compensate for people out on MLOA and everything. I cannot handle having people over, MUCH LESS a very pregnant woman.

Husband understands why I don't want people over, but he's doing it anyway. I get that. I see that he wants to see his best friend, but he's going down to visit them for his best friend's wedding in just a few months. There's no talking to him anymore about this; it's led to arguments that I'm too stressed out to have now.

Am I selfish for not wanting to have people over? Is it wrong and stupid to feel inferior and upset over having a pregnant woman shoved in my face? Sure, I have to face pregnancy in the real world - but this is my home! I should feel safe, right?!

Questions

IVF 2: 18 eggs harvested, but only 10 were mature (IVF 1 : 26 harvested and 18 mature ).

* What would be the ideal protocol to increase the number of mature eggs?
* Can the low percentage of mature eggs be attributed to the trigger?
* Could a longer stimulation and HGH trigger help? Could HGH help improve quality if we do injections during the cycle?

* CoQ10: Useful to increase quality?

* HGH injections to stimulate the testicles: useful in our case?

* Is a combined cycle (half the eggs fertilized with donor sperm and the other with husband's sperm) possible?

* Donor: get our blood types. What is the CMV status? Factors to consider?

* Do we need to check my hormone levels?
Level of hormone releasing hormone during stimulation? (FSH and LH).

* Can we check antibodies (Cause of failures TEC). Should we redo some tests? One way to know if the uterus is correct and receptive?

* Options for IUI : not even sure ovulating (OKP inconclusive, first RE told me not to bother with that, and never ask, as direct to IVF.) So... what about IUI options?

* Request for karyotype.

* Could someone run the mathematical model to know the chance of normal embryo with the translocation? It have been done. And per scientific literature, might be hopeless with chromosomes 13 involve. 

*  Can we have a request to consult the specialist in PGD at McGill? We would like more details on translocation to determine whether it is worthwhile to repeat an IVF with micro-tese, or if the chances of success are too low.

The count ended up being 9.9mil with just over 70% motility, so pretty good. They said they like the count to be 10mil or above.

I can tell there's been some activity going on because I've felt bloated, crampy and some brief sharp pangs. The nurse said that I am ""definitely ovulating"" because I had a lot of cervical mucus. As always, fingers are crossed.

That caused some stress (pay for one cycle, more, etc), but we paid for one cycle (that was converted to IUI). About a week after I got my period, I moved to new state. 

I made an appt with an RE at an academic clinic here that was recommended by my first RE. That was yesterday and now I have decisions to make. 

First, I really liked the RE I met. I loved my first RE, but didn't see her much going through the process. I think that might be a little better here (it seems likely that it's a bit more personal). His recommendation matched and even augmented the plan that was recommended after my WTF call (didn't have a formal WTF appt since I wasn't continuing at that practice). 

*side note, he says that there is some pretty good evidence that human growth hormone supplementation can help with ovarian response/egg quality... it isn't definitive (nothing is), but it may even be more evidence than CoQ10... just throwing that out there for info*

Anyway, we agree that IVF is obviously still the way to go (husband's TMC fluctuates after clomid between 6 and 15 million) and that while my dominant follicle was a problem with the first IVF round, we're going to go all out with this one and throw everything at my ovaries to make sure that they get their shit together.  (This means for me, bc suppression, lupron microdose, then high dose gonadotropins and hGH). He says his aim is that at the end we aren't left wondering if ""maybe we had..."" or ""I wish we had"" and know we gave it the best shot. 

While that sounds great, it sounds so scary, too... that we'd have to consider donor eggs/embryos after just one full attempt? 

So all of that novella leads into the question... do we pay for a single cycle? Do we do one of the AttainIVF programs where you pay for up to 2 egg retrievals (I think for our situation 3 really makes no sense)? I know this is everyone's question, but I'm throwing it out there.

129,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This post will probably be all over the place. I'm still trying to process everything, but I have questions.

To recap: Lost a tube to an ectopic 8 years ago now. Initially got the referral to an RE for my short LP. Finally found the progesterone dose that fixed that the same cycle as my first visit, but I decided to start the process anyway. AMH and HSG for me are both great (almost 3 for AMH and my existing tube is clear) and SA was very middle-of-the-road numbers, well above the low ranges. 

Two Clomid cycles with 3-5 17-26mm follicles each, at least 1 or 2 on the ovary with the tube. Took a month off to travel for my sister's wedding and got diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Took a couple more months off to get that fixed and suddenly my 8-9 day LP is now 13-14 days. Get my TSH levels tested at 2.something and have an annovulatory cycle. End that to try one last Clomid cycle now that my thyroid is fixed. This time, ovary without the tube has two decent follicles and ovary with the tube has zero. Doc asks for an appointment to discuss next steps.

I'm currently somewhere between 3 and 10 DPO. I didn't track because I expected to trigger, but my temp the day after my monitoring appointment where we realized it wasn't worth triggering was firmly in pre-O territory and the past 3 days have been firmly post-O territory.

So I show up to the appointment today intending to ask for injectables and IUI. We've sorta discussed that before, and he was OK with injectables but didn't think I needed IUI. However he said he'd do it if I asked.

We talk a bit about how my most recent Clomid cycle did not get results on the 'good' side. He says (when I bring it up) that the first two Clomid cycles failing probably weren't due to my hypothyroidism, since that can disrupt ovulation but I definitely ovulated well for those two cycles. He does think that the unmedicated LP lengthening was due to my thyroid levels being fixed, though. He then says ""but you don't know for sure that you aren't pregnant this cycle yet"". I'm like well.. I haven't had my period.. but I had no follicles on the ovary with the tube. Sure, we've both heard it's theoretically possible for the other tube to reach over, but not very likely.

He asks what I want to do next. I say IUI and better drugs. He thinks about it for a minute and says that's fine, since the TI hasn't worked even with a good Clomid response so far. He says if I have one IUI with 6 follicles on the correct side, he may not recommend a second. Either way, he doesn't think any more than 2 'good' IUIs will be worth it. At that point I should just save for IVF. That was kind of my game plan after 2 anyway, so I'm OK with that. Still odd for him to say he might not recommend even a second with 6 or so follicles, isn't it? I thought that even with a really good response docs liked to do 2-3 cycles of IUI.

I'll go in for a baseline on CD3, which I haven't done before. He says he'll put me on Femara CD 3-7, Follistim CD 5-9, and ultrasound on CD10. If that's good, I'll trigger (that night or the next night, I think?) and come in two mornings later for the IUI. This all seems reasonable, right? 

He doesn't do blood work for IUIs, even with injectables. The ultrasound tech (which technically isn't part of his office, he just visits my town once a week and the tech I see is part of the office he visits) has said before that anything but Clomid is generally given blood work to check estradiol levels. Is it normal to not have blood work with Follistim?

He then says ""Man, it'd be great if you were actually pregnant this month."" I'm like.. yeah.. but.. we already talked about how I didn't respond on the side with the tube.. I get that he's trying to be optimistic, but we both know reality. I almost think he's hoping for me so hard this month just for the medical novelty of getting me pregnant on an ovary without a tube.

He moves on to the next patient and I talk to nurse a bit more about the scheduling and scripts. She says if I don't have a preference for pharmacy, she'll call Gonal-F instead of Follistim into Freedom. Anyone know if there's a better place to go for this? I know I'm getting into more expensive meds now and I'd obviously like to minimize that as much as possible, being self-pay and all. Also, I forgot to ask what dose.

So a lot of you know my story. Retrieval last November followed by cancelled fresh cycle due to severe OHSS and months of FETs cancelled due to lining issues. I finally had an ERA in June and it looked great. My doctor was off all of July so I've been waiting to finally do our first FET... for real this time!

This cycle the clinics communications had been TERRIBLE, for CD1 it took 3 days for a nurse to call me back, left a message every one of these days asking someone to call me as I had questions...  I only ever called once a day to be respectful and not bother them. 

I had my lining check yesterday (I had it done in a hospital in Alberta, I receive treatment in Ontario). Once my US was done I called the clinic immediately and told them they should expect to receive it within a half an hour (this was around 1pm ON time). I felt kind of brushed off. And she sounded annoyed that I was even calling to let her know. 

No call yesterday with further instructions. So I called this morning to check to make sure they received the US. Which she confirmed and said a nurse would be calling me... fast forward to 230 no one has called. Nurses are finished at 3. I call the clinic again and plead to talk to someone. Let them know I'm quite anxious as I should be starting meds tomorrow according to my schedule. Nurse comes on, fumbling around can't find my US results... I definitely get the sense I've been forgotten... I'm told she will call and leave me a message in 10 minutes with instructions. 

I pick up the message ... they have changed my transfer days.... from the 22nd to the 24th..   I've booked ALL my flights around it being on the 22nd... was to be leaving on the 24th.... you have to be kidding me!!! After all of this! And now the nurses are gone... I'm crying now... 

So I call my RE doctors office (separate from the fertility clinic)...and explain to the receptionist... she says she will have a nurse call me. 

When the nurse calls me she was SOOO insensitive. Blaming it on me. Asking me why I booked flights without being told a transfer date... I explained..  that actually she was the one who gave the transfer date 2 weeks ago... it was of course based on my lining being ok... and then she has the balls to say... well what if your lining hadn't been ok... then what would you have done?? BUT my lining is fine... how dare you even bring that up?! Then says to me well we didn't get your US results until today.... actually no no you didn't. 

So anywyas it turns out my days were switched not for my benefit or to increase my chances, but because there are now the max number of procedures booked for the Monday.... Really??? So she says it's out of my hands now that'll she'll have to talk to the doctor and head of the lab..  

She calls me back and says they've agreed to ""let it go this time"" (again I feel like placing the blame on me)... and we are going ahead with transfer on Monday. 

This should be such an exciting time for me... finally getting to transfer. But the way I was treated today felt so unfair. She took no responsibility for what happened. No empathy or compassion for what I have gone through or am going through.

Am I over reacting. Are the hormones making me crazy or do I need to adress this further??

I was thinking about this because yesterday we ended up selling a used fridge to the husband of this woman I kind of know from a book club.

Let us know if you ever want to borrow one!"". He obviously has no idea about our IF but I wanted to punch him.

But my worst thing is this one (which some of you know):
I was telling a very close friend of mine about my MC. She had a baby back in Jan and has PCOS and it took her 9 or 10 months to conceive (I know) which she acted like was the longest ever, so you'd think she'd have some sense. But when I told her that I would have been due in December, she said ""well, nobody wants a Christmas baby anyway"". 
I mean, seriously.

She had also said something about us both getting pregnant together this fall, even though she knew we were doing IVF. Like I can just up and decide to get pregnant.

At the time I let it go - I know she had good intentions, but  
I've come to realize what an incredibly stupid and selfish thing to say, and am now distancing from her.

My husband and I are undergoing all of our preliminary testing for infertility. So far my SIS and HSG appear to be normal.

I'm wondering if my symptoms are more related to my thyroid (because when my bloodwork is normal, I have less menstrual cramps with my period). I was involved in a forum discussion recently about endo and all of the women had short periods and bad cramps which scared me because it sounded so similar to my symptoms.

My periods are regular between 28-31 days. I spot brown for 2-3 days before my period. My ""full flow"" period is 2-3 days of a light to medium flow. I then spot for another few days as my period is ending. I do get cramps, but they seem better now that my thyroid is treated. The cramps are painful and usually I'll take a few extra strength tylenol so that I can function (especially if I need to be at work).

Back in end of May, the clinic/lab submitted all my claims at once to insurance, even though many were out of network.

I've been lurking for awhile after finally unsubscribing to TFAB because, well, it's TFAB. I'm 30 and my husband is 35. We've been trying for #1 since November 2014. I had high prolactin and wasn't ovulating so we fixed that but I still wasn't ovulating normally. 


Three cycles of Femara and one chemical pregnancy later, we started Follistim/Ovidrel. First cycle didn't work, had to skip a cycle due to hyperstim. Currently on CD15. Details and questions below: 


I am on my second cycle of Follistim/Ovidrel injections. The first cycle was a couple months ago and I was on the verge of cancellation due to lots of huge follicles and estradiol at 1400 but we went ahead with the cycle. It didn't work, obviously. My CD1 follicle scan after that showed 40mm+ follicles so we had to skip a cycle to let them calm down.


Fast forward to today! I'm on CD15. We've been manipulating my Follistim dosage every couple of days to hopefully not hyperstim this time. Last Friday I had a couple 10+ ones so we lowered the dose even more for the weekend. Today, however, I had almost 10 over 10mm and 4-5 of those were over 18mm. They wanted to immediately cancel but I asked for an estradiol level first. It was 1052 so they said we could go forward with the emphasis on high risk for multiples, obviously.


My question comes in here: the RE said to just do 1/2 of the Ovidrel dose (so 125 miU instead of 250miU) to lower the risk of hyperstimulation (which the HCG can do). But will it even work? The IUI is scheduled for Wednesday morning. I'm nervous we did all of this finessing just to end up with a failed ovulation anyway.
Has anyone ever done a half dose? Did it work?


Edit: going to add a question: 3 hours after my trigger shot I had what I usually feel as mittelschmirz on the side the large follicles were on. I'm worried I ovulated early and the IUI will be a waste. My temp this morning was 98.4 (pre-o average is 97.1 for me) but it was also earlier than I normally temp.


Wondering if we should go ahead and have sex today in case it was ovulation but don't want to lower his counts for Wednesday.

I have DOR (at 31 y.o., 3-5 follicles per cycle, AMH .55) and after stimming 8 days, they said only one follicle was maturing well. It was 19mm and the next largest was 13mm. I felt like we could've stimmed a few days longer and maybe snagged them both, but the Dr said we might risk losing that nice big one if we waited. So the one egg we got this morning was great quality and hoping to find out tomorrow if it fertilized. 
Then they said something else that was surprising, and that was that if it does fertilize, they'd implant on day 3. This, they said, was bc of it just being one egg; they'd normally wait the regular 5 days if they had 2 or more embryos to choose from, but since they don't, there's no benefit to growing it in the lab and not in my uterus. No one has at any point mentioned FET as an option or alternative.
Additionally, when they told us Saturday that we'd stop stimming early and trigger, they offered to cancel the retrieval and opt for an IUI, since IVF would only be doubling our odds instead of tripling or quadrupling, like it would if we'd have gotten more eggs. They offered to cancel so that we could save our money for donor eggs if we wanted. 
Maybe it's just because I've read too many of y'alls stories and haven't heard anything like this, or maybe it's bc I'm too optimistic, or maybe it's bc I really want to have a baby with my own eggs, but all of this sounds very odd to me. Am I being paranoid? If this doesn't work out should I get a second opinion from another facility? I really trusted them, through this whole process I've felt very strongly about that, but this just feels weird. I'm trying to be realistic that DOR and low AMH often means poor response to stims, and donor eggs are often the only solution, but I don't know. I feel a little weirded out by the way it's progressed. Any advice?

Need your valuable suggestions. I am currently suppressing on BCP before starting IVF and have 10 days to get,

-	Insurance clearance
-	Financial coordinator clearance 
-	Order medications (never guessed this part would be so tricky!)

I have infertility coverage through my provider (UHC) with a lifetime cap of $18000.

Based on what I gleaned from some earlier posts on this topic, I talked to an in-network pharmacy (Freedom) to get an estimate of cost if paying out of pocket vs insurance (co-pays).

They quoted around $7000 (including rebates) if paying out of pocket and $1200 through insurance. As good as this sounds, the deal breaker is... they are billing the insurance like crazy.

I grilled the pharmacy rep for a little bit more and learnt that I will be paying lower price for the same medication than what they would bill insurance. For example, 1 Gonal-F pen would cost me $950 out of pocket, and insurance would be billed > $2000.

<p>I have infertility coverage through my provider (UHC) with a lifetime cap of $18000.</p>

<p>Based on what I gleaned from some earlier posts on this topic, I talked to an in-network pharmacy (Freedom) to get an estimate of cost if paying out of pocket vs insurance (co-pays).</p>

<p>They quoted around $7000 (including rebates) if paying out of pocket and $1200 through insurance. As good as this sounds, the deal breaker is... they are billing the insurance like crazy.

So, after 4 years of trying to get, and stay, pregnant with clomid, letrozole, timed sex and IUI, my husband and I are moving on to IVF. I have ""lean"" PCOS and possibly also a low-ish thyroid (TSH is 3).

My doc says I can start IVF as soon as I get my period again (which, because I have pcos with long, unpredictable cycles could be anywhere from this week to 3 weeks from now). I'm on the fence about starting this month as planned, or waiting until the following cycle, when our move and Labor Day fun time will be over with. The downside is because my cycles are so long, that could push us into an October start date. And after 4 years of trying I just want to be pregnant already and get this IVF shit over with.

I had two embryo&#39;s transferred on 8/4/16 meaning I&#39;m on my 2 week wait before my blood test. I&#39;m on progesterone 3 times a day until hopefully, fingers crossed, 10 weeks pregnant. I have three more day until I go for my testing and feel absolutely nothing. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m pregnant, no symptoms at all except for sore boobs which is a side effect from the progesterone. Has anyone else had a positive after IVF with no symptoms? I&#39;m freaking out that this cycle has failed and I&#39;ll have to start all over again. I might also just be overthinking this and worrying because I&#39;m in the TWW. </p>

I'm not a frequent poster here, but I lurk fairly often because I feel as though you are the only people who really understand how I've felt at times. That was solidified for me the other day, with a comment my mother made. 

My mother went into the hospital recently for a hysterectomy. She is 45 years old and has a whopping **seven** children. Before she left for the hospital I asked her how she was feeling.

""Oh you know, I wasn't planning on having any more children but I hate that they are taking the choice away from me and I don't feel like any of you *(implying the family)* understand""

I don't think I can at all adequately express the sheer rage she filled me with when she said that. My first thought? ""No b*tch, LIFE took the choice away from you when you could neither afford nor properly raise the children you already have!"". But I bit my tongue and instead thought about how she could dare to say that to her infertile daughter who hasn't ovulated since she was 15/16. Who she constantly pressures to make grandbabies for her.

Yeah, sure. No one understands how you feel, losing the ability to conceive when you have **seven** children that you don't ever seem to appreciate. Children that you take ANY opportunity to leave in my care while you go out. 

I am well and truly hurt by how insensitive she could be. She has always been in denial about my infertility, assuring me that I don't know my own condition or my own body as well as she does. Now, she has invalidated all the pain I have gone through for years trying to cope with this. The pain of feeling like a freak as a teen, of worrying I would never be good enough for anyone because I might not be able to give them children, of feeling unfeminine and a sub-par woman. She has been extremely mean to me in life, but this...This felt down-right cruel.

With my husband, we have been trying to NOT have kids by using the withdrawal method. Not really super effective, but for us, it has worked.

Actually, it has always worked for me. I have statistically defied the odds since I was 19.

Here's the short story:

19-21: serious college boyfriend. condoms
21-23: another serious boyfriend. also condoms and the pill

23 -- started seeing a new psychiatrist. at 17, I was misdiagnosed bipolar and given an antipsychotic. I'm still on it now, at a lower dose. At 23 I was then given anti-anxiety meds and an anti-convulsant type med to help combat side effects of anti-convuslant. For those who don't know: These are all documentd, by by FDA, to cause infertility. Unknown if stopping them helps, though I'm working on that anyway. It'll take about 5 years due to the weaning off/withdrawal process.

23-25. Kinda slept around. I had one stable guy I had a ""thing"" with, and we used withdrawal method, no other birth control. The other two years were a blur. I know there was at least 2 other guys I slept with that condoms weren't always used with, and I vividly remember a few accidents and thinking ""ah, whatever, I won't get pregnant."" Never did.

Then I really got into my career, hyperfocused, dated someone else for 2 years. Condoms always. Tried birth control again, hormones almost landed me in hospital. So, no hormones for me.

We broke up, I was sad, then eventually met my husband. I was on depo for one round (3 months) but that's it at the very beginning of dating. He always does withdraw completely. 

My issue is now this: Out of X number of times I've had sex, I'd have to say, including marriage, about 60-70% of them were using the withdrawal method. This seems like, at some point, I should have become pregnant, which makes us think I might have a fertility issue.

I'm meeting with my doctor about this, but I'd like my reasons to be taken seriously.

I&#39;ve decided to not have kids, so far, but the option is not off the table. With my husband, we have been trying to NOT have kids by using the withdrawal method. Not really super effective, but for us, it has worked.</p>

<p>Actually, it has always worked for me. I have statistically defied the odds since I was 19.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the short story:</p>

<p>19-21: serious college boyfriend. condoms
21-23: another serious boyfriend. also condoms and the pill</p>

<p>23 -- started seeing a new psychiatrist. at 17, I was misdiagnosed bipolar and given an antipsychotic. I&#39;m still on it now, at a lower dose. At 23 I was then given anti-anxiety meds and an anti-convulsant type med to help combat side effects of anti-convuslant. For those who don&#39;t know: These are all documentd, by by FDA, to cause infertility. Unknown if stopping them helps, though I&#39;m working on that anyway. It&#39;ll take about 5 years due to the weaning off/withdrawal process.</p>

<p>23-25. Kinda slept around. I had one stable guy I had a &quot;thing&quot; with, and we used withdrawal method, no other birth control. The other two years were a blur. I know there was at least 2 other guys I slept with that condoms weren&#39;t always used with, and I vividly remember a few accidents and thinking &quot;ah, whatever, I won&#39;t get pregnant.&quot; Never did.</p>

<p>Then I really got into my career, hyperfocused, dated someone else for 2 years. Condoms always. Tried birth control again, hormones almost landed me in hospital. So, no hormones for me.</p>

<p>We broke up, I was sad, then eventually met my husband. I was on depo for one round (3 months) but that&#39;s it at the very beginning of dating. He always does withdraw completely. </p>

<p>My issue is now this: Out of X number of times I&#39;ve had sex, I&#39;d have to say, including marriage, about 60-70% of them were using the withdrawal method. This seems like, at some point, I should have become pregnant, which makes us think I might have a fertility issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;m meeting with my doctor about this, but I&#39;d like my reasons to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Is there reason to think its just THAT effective?</p>

<p>Otherwise, aside from my backstory, what do I need to ask for in terms of testing or referrals?</p>

The thing is, I can't have my cell phone at work and I don't have access to email outside of my work email.  So if I miss their call while I'm not at my desk, I have to call back.  This isn't really a bad thing, except they always seem to call me at the end of the day (and their office closes at 3:30), so I have no way to actually speak to someone if I miss the call.

They also routinely call my home, even though, their sign in sheet asks what number you will be reachable at during the hours where they call with the monitoring results.

I have repeatedly asked if I can be one of the earlier calls, as I'm usually around my desk at that time and I get a ""Oh yes, definitely!""....and then I'm not.

Also, my nurse that I've been dealing with for the past year inexplicably left the clinic two days before my betas were run on my last cycle.  When I was overseas, experiencing my chemical, I had to keep calling the office to ask who I was even supposed to talk to which was really frustrating since they couldn't figure out how to call me back on the international cell phone number.  I didn't find out that my nurse had left the practice until my repeat beta earlier this week.

I still don't have a new nurse assigned to me, and this is particularly frustrating because if I have to go on BC for my FET, I need them to call in a refill for the BC.  I called this morning to ask, but since I don't have a nurse assigned to me, they didn't file the note with anyone.  I just had to call back again.

I was really pissed off about it at first, but then I was like ok whatever, I'll use this time for a few more last chance tries before we do the IVF (already had three failed IUIs in the last few months). So the meds they had me on for the IUIs definitely messed with my schedule. One thing that has been good, yet obviously frustrating, is that I am like a well oiled clock when it comes to my schedule. Always 28 days, always ovulate at the same time in my cycle, seriously my cycle should win an award... if only it would allow me to get pregnant.

I had a failed IUI two months ago. (The last of the 3) Tried on our own the following month. Nope. Tried on our own last month, got my period, so nope. Got my period only a day off last month (2 weeks) ago, but it's my ovulation that seems messed up now.

While being on the meds, I noticed I ovulated very late. Figured it was because that bad boy was cooking in there or something. Came off the meds and it appears I'm ovulating super early. Also I had really bad cramping when I ovulated this time, which I never had in the past. This week I should have ovulated Saturday-Monday, because I ended my cycle on Friday of last week. So you can imagine my shock yesterday when I went with my gut and peed on an OPK stick and got 2 red lines yesterday. Which meant screaming at my husband to come home now... super sexy.

I've felt almost sick all week, had cramping bad, very ""full-feeling"" ovaries and even back aches.... seriously wtf?

I was really pissed off about it at first, but then I was like ok whatever, I&#39;ll use this time for a few more last chance tries before we do the IVF (already had three failed IUIs in the last few months). So the meds they had me on for the IUIs definitely messed with my schedule. One thing that has been good, yet obviously frustrating, is that I am like a well oiled clock when it comes to my schedule. Always 28 days, always ovulate at the same time in my cycle, seriously my cycle should win an award... if only it would allow me to get pregnant.</p>

<p>I had a failed IUI two months ago. (The last of the 3) Tried on our own the following month. Nope. Tried on our own last month, got my period, so nope. Got my period only a day off last month (2 weeks) ago, but it&#39;s my ovulation that seems messed up now.</p>

<p>While being on the meds, I noticed I ovulated very late. Figured it was because that bad boy was cooking in there or something. Came off the meds and it appears I&#39;m ovulating super early. Also I had really bad cramping when I ovulated this time, which I never had in the past. This week I should have ovulated Saturday-Monday, because I ended my cycle on Friday of last week.

She went through the whole past cycle with us. She showed us our embryo ratings for each day and how they were all pretty behind from the start. She said it will worry her if we end up with a similar result in the end because obviously with 19 follicles, we should have ended up with *something*.

Without my provocation, she said she'd like to switch me to an antagonist protocol. She's worried about the lupron trigger for me with PCOS (as sometimes that doesn't cause a surge), so we'll have Ovidrel as a backup the next day if the bloodwork doesn't show I have an LH surge the morning after. She wants to keep me on a pretty low FSH protocol - 150 a day but it will be split between gonal-f and menopur which she is hoping the LH in menopur will be the secret to the crap results that happened last time and get my eggs to their proper maturity. I asked why we wouldn't bump up the FSH to try to get more eggs, and she said that more isn't always better, and that could just give us more immature follicles rather than get any of them to maturity. She's going to have me wait to trigger until my lead follicles are at 23mm instead of 21mm, as well.

Knowing that this is synching up pretty well with what my 2nd opinion RE said yesterday, I'm feeling a lot more confident now about staying with my original RE. The 2nd RE cycles everyone together and had the FSH amounts even printed on the calendar sheet, which made me hesitate a little when I was reviewing everything last night. I'm sure he would have adjusted according to my response, but it just was a bit odd to see that they're giving everyone the same calendar and protocol from the start.

I am glad my original RE is keeping it real with us that there may be an egg quality issue that is causing this problem, but we're also trying something different so that we can pinpoint if it was the protocol that was the problem or if it's me.

Best of all - she's not making me wait to start stimming until I return from vacation. She's having me bring my meds with me and start 3 days before we return so she'll do my first monitoring the day after. That makes it so we're not getting retrieval pushed out into October - we should be somewhere in the final week of September.

This is the first day since last Thursday that I haven't felt totally broken, so that's good. I know I need to curb my optimism because we could end up truly devastated again, but at least I'll know we're not repeating our mistakes and getting another good set of datapoints to work with.

Basically, I was supposed to do injectables this month plus monitoring and TI but because of my RE's office staff and their inability to call anyone back in a timely manner, we are now benched this cycle. And they didn't even have the decency to apologize to me. 

I called them on Friday to tell them that my period had started because I needed a baseline ultrasound before CD6, but they are only open until noon on Friday and you have to leave a message for start of menses, so, of course, I didn't get a call back. They waited until 3 o-fucking-clock to call me on Monday when they close at 4. Unfortunately I missed the call. I called back and got a live person for once but the nurse had already left. I had talked to the Dr. Friday and he told me  not to worry about the ultrasound, so I told them to just call me back in the morning to tell me about medicine and all that. Tuesday morning they called me at 9 but, again I missed the call because I'm a teacher and it was opening day and I was in a meeting. I called back at 9:45, was put on hold for 20 minutes and then told the nurse would call me back in just a little bit. I waited for an hour and a half and then called back and was put on hold for a half a fucking hour when the fucking nurse finally picked up the phone. All of that to tell me I couldn't start the meds unless I had an ultrasound. She said the doctor didn't know/realize who he was talking to on Friday and that it would be a bad idea to start the meds without the ultrasound.

So I'm basically between a rock and a hard place. There's no way I can get to the clinic before they close and my gyno is booked solid except for 1:30 the next day (today) which I absolutely can't do (first day of school).

If they had called me earlier on Monday instead of waiting until fucking 3pm I COULD HAVE COME IN FOR THE ULTRASOUND THAT DAY. 

I am absolutely livid. Because of them, I'm stuck waiting another month. Because of them I get to live this fresh hell that much longer. Because of them I have basically no hope this month. I mean, we can try on our own but since I don't fucking ovulate, it's pretty well a lost cause.

Even though I had a ""perfect"" 22mm follicle on CD16, there were some other mishaps during the cycle (I somehow managed to lose my last femara pill and I was in Africa attending my sister's wedding at the time so I only took it for 4 days, and on the morning of the IUI we lost the majority of our sample due to me holding the cup at the wrong angle... but I digress). This cycle I was determined that everything was going to go right. I had my CD12 ultrasound on Monday 8/8 and that was a little disappointing, only one follicle ""committed to growth"" at 14.4mm but I remained super optimistic.  Things are going to go right this cycle, they have to, last time was just beginners bad luck. Last night, I come home from work & open up the fridge to get something out for dinner and notice that it is unusually warm... Long story short, our newish refrigerator (purchased it in 2012) is broken. Thinking that I will be triggering the next day I panic about my Ovidrel having sat in a non-working refrigerator all day, and immediately get on the phone with the pharmacy, all thoughts of dinner vanished. Thankfully the pharmacist assures me that as long as I use the meds in the next 30 days there is no need to worry about them coming up to room temp, and I am reassured. In my mind it's another blow to my hopes of a perfect cycle, but I can handle it. This morning I go into the RE for CD14 ultrasound - the same CD last cycle where I was informed of my perfect follicle and told to trigger that evening. There is a new sonographer who I have never seen before doing my ultrasound, but I am not worried because I am going to have another perfect follicle. She then proceeds to jab me in the vag for almost 20 minutes without ever getting a clear image of my left ovary (where the growing follicle was located 2 days ago), requests that I press on my stomach, and when I complain that this whole procedure is very painful tells me ""I'm sorry honey, but if I don't push I won't be able to see anything"". I'm no ultrasound tech, but I've never had an issue with any of my other numerous ultrasounds, the first of which was at age 15 when I was still a virgin and received my PCOS diagnosis. My ovaries are very PCOS-y so I can always see them in all their polka dotted glory pretty clearly. This time I felt like she was pressing the wand so far inside of me that I might split open, all the while taking measurements of what looks to me like arbitrary lines of static on the screen. When she decides we are done she tells me that she couldn't find anything bigger then 12mm and I'll just have to come back in another 2 days. I am fuming... I don't want to blame her but at the same time I've never felt like this after an ultrasound. The pain was almost as bad as my HSG, and that is saying something. Instead of going to work like I should have post wanding I headed straight back home to complain to my husband and so he could hold me while I cried. Now that I'm done being sad & pissed, I'm just full of questions. Is it possible for a growing follicle to shrink after 2 days? Was it not really there on Monday in the first place? Do I have any hope for a decent sized follicle on Friday? Will I walk into the room and see the same lady and have a panic attack? Who knows... I took the day off today and I'm going to sit at home in my yoga pants, cuddle my fur children, eat some ice cream, and try to get my mind right for whatever comes next.

I&#39;m excited and sad at the same time. I just want to get this show on the road.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, this past cycle I had barely an fertile CM, but that might be cuz I tried Guaifenesin. Pretty sure it dried me up, or it could of been all the sex we had too haha. Is there anything I can take to produce more CM? I take evening primrose oil, I don&#39;t see much difference. </p>

<p>Anything else I can do to make myself more fertile? Or should I just &quot;relax it&#39;ll happen&quot; (sarcasm)... </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve taken you advise and booked back in with my doctor to get the referral to the RE. I&#39;ll ask about clomid if I do iui and see what he says but for now I&#39;m saying no. </p>

Did 4 cycles of clomid from Okt 2015 to Jan 2016 with no noticable problems. The first cycle without clomid I started spot bleeding every day(CD1 was the 2. feb). I wrote my GYN who had done the IUI and it also coincided with the first visit with he Hospital for IVF (22. feb.). I told the hospital about this bleeding and they did a quick twat-wanding and assured me  my uterus looked great and I should just see if the bleeding stopped by it self. No time frame was given. The answer I got from my GYN was the same via email. ""lets wait and see""

The bleeding became less and less and often I though ""Now it has finally stopped!"" only to realise that I was still bleeding but it was staying inside my uterus long before coming out. So I was really battling if I needed to call the doctor or if everything was on track as it was getting less and less. (realisation hit around May, had a scheduled meeting in June but it was a large auditorium and 2 hours talk so completely forgot to ask at the end. July was closed for the holidays....)

Now:

The hospitals RE has been closed for the summer all of July and I was in Poland all of last week. So called them up Monday morning and they wanted to see me and I got an appointment today which I have just gotten back from.

She listen to me and says, well we sure want to figure out what is wrong before we start IVF! We will do a water-scan of your uterus, claumydia test(mandatory) and a Smear as yours is over a year old. (luckily it is just before my ovulation else I would have had to wait longer!)

Got up and she did:

* Twat-wanding for a quick check - Everything looks perfect! Nice lining.
* Physical check where she opened with a speculum -  hmm there is quite a bit of blood here... (damn...). I can see where it is coming from.
* Claumydia swap after cleaning blood away
* Smear test after cleaning again....
* water Scan - you Uterus looks perfect, all smooth not even a tiny blemish

She explained that the bleeding is coming from the cervix is due to the ""transformation zone"" being very open so the inside of the cervix walls are exposed to the outside(vagina). She told me that normally the transformation zone are positioner so there is only a very small opening into the cervix and thereby protects the more sensitive cervix walls.

This explains the bleeding but doesn't explain why I has suddenly appeared after Clomid. Going to have to wait 10 days for lab reports on the test she took. Then she will contact me but she isn't ruling out polyps yet. She said I would probably have to go for a colposcopy for further analysis.

What is bugging me is that she said that after 1 month of spotting these tests should have been started. No one gave me any time frame to work with, when I voiced my worry, and It had been going on for 20 days when I was at the hospital where I was told everything looked fine and to wait and see. Why wasn't I told ""If you are still spotting next cycle call us"" or something similar. When I don't get a time frame I assume it can be a while. Al I was told was to focus on loosing weight and then you know life happens and you keep getting distracted by the million other things you have to remember to ask about.

Part of me is a little frustrated that I'm having to fill in some of the blanks for her. She started out the call saying that she's so sorry, and that maybe ""this"" was the issue all along. So I said, ""do you mean egg quality?"" Yes.

So to recap, I started this shit journey with irregular cycles and a OBGYN who wouldn't do anything to help me. Fast forward and my RE confirms PCOS and hypothyroid. I complain about immense cramping during my period and through this sub come to realize it's probably endo. We do a lap - stage IV endo. We muddle through IUIs with me having to essentially take off every other cycle because cysts. Then I have a polyp. We finally *finally* get to IVF. I respond well and think with 19 eggs that for sure we'll get at least one blast. [And here I am with zero.](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4w6ly4/ivf_1_absolute_fail/)

She wants me to do my same protocol (long lupron) again this time adding in menopur because she thinks the small amount of LH it has may help my eggs get to maturity. She also wants to wait an extra day to trigger because I had a lot of follicles in the 15mm range, and she hopes to give those a boost.

I asked if this next cycle fails, if we'll be able to change anything and try again or if donor eggs are basically the next option. She said that if this cycle doesn't improve, that would be her next recommendation. I'm definitely not prepared to move there yet, but I wanted to gauge how shitty my situation is.

I told my husband if this 2nd IVF fails, I want to take a 3-6 month break and eat clean, lose weight, and see if we can get some better eggs queued up. I feel like only trying one IVF protocol with a slight variation in stims isn't really trying all of our options. [I read this article](http://haveababy.com/fertility-information/ivf-authority/case-study-poor-quality-eggsembryos-in) which I know is consulting Dr. Google - but it's more about the fact that I want to exhaust all our options. Since I am a high responder I feel like we'll be jumping the gun after 2 IVF cycles to move to donor eggs. 

Lastly, I asked her about metformin again and she said there aren't any studies on that helping egg quality. Only helping ovulation for PCOS ladies, and the reason she never put me on it before is because I'm not IR. It kind of annoys me because I know it's being studied basically as a wonderdrug for anti-aging... like why not put me on? Just to try?

So now I wait until I can get put on BCP and try again. Of course we have a 10 day trip scheduled in September, so I'm sure that will fuck with the timing of everything.

Supposed to be 7 weeks, but then my HCG fell and the doctor could only see a small tissue on the ultrasound. Had a D&C.

I got a call last week that I have hypothyroidism (I swear I was screened for this before and it came back normal, but I guess not this time). The doctor phoned in a prescription for me, and I have an appointment with him Friday. I googled and it says hypothyroidism could lead to fertility issues and miscarriage (also, I know it's vain, but I hope I lose weight on the medication). After all this time, part of me is tempted to take this medication and see what happens. What if this is all that's been holding me back? Or am I being naive?

I'm planning on talking to him about it on Friday, but was wondering if anyone here had any experience with or knowledge of this condition.

Little back story, my ex best friend and I had a falling out after my house burnt down almost 3 yrs ago. We lost everything. Worst off we lost our dogs. And it was one week before Christmas. My life legit fell apart. So my best friend was nowhere to be found when this happened. It took her 2 days to answer my text when I told her what happened!

""Oh sorry, didn't know what to say..."" 

How about, ""sorry and you know all that clothes you gave me a few months ago, do you need a pair of pants?""

Apparently that was ""too difficult"" for her. She didn't want to deal with me being sad. Because if everything isn't all about her, she wants nothing to do with it. 

A few weeks go by, we had tickets to a play (pre-fire), she texts me to say she'll sell my ticket for me. Wtf? I say no and go to the play. She all but ignores me. 

Another few weeks and I invite her and 2 of my other friends who like dropped everything to be by my side over for pizza. The night isn't about her so she is a BITCH to my other friends. That was it. I went full on NC with her. 

So last night, I randomly log into FB and see one of my friends has knit her something for ""the baby."" I seriously felt like I had been kicked in the teeth and the gut. Yep, she's due in a few weeks. 

I had a good 10-15 minute scream and cry session where hubs TOTALLY had my back. Today I'm better bc her life has no bearings on mine. I'm sure her almost 40 yr old BF who sells tshirts he makes in his parents basement has everything under control. (I'm not kidding.)

ER is slated for Tuesday.

Since low AMH means that not as many follicles show up to the party, I am living with the anxiety/concern about the retrieval and of course will any of the few make it to transfer?  To top it off, this morning I had some doctor I never met before and he didn’t show me the screen or talk to me much except to say that I’m ready for trigger and “things look good”.  My last wanding two days ago I had 3 on the right, 4 on the left with all on the left outpacing the right and a possible dominant.  

Mr. Ruin has had three SA’s with different morphology results of 0% (the result that sent me running to an RE in the first place), 5%, and 4% so we’ll be doing ICSI.  Insurance wanted us to do six iui’s since his morph wasn’t low enough to require IVF and then my amh came back at 0.5 soooo yeah, insurance came around.  

Stims were okay and the advice to take things out of the fridge for some time before really cut back on some of the burn.  Mr. Ruin is doing my injections because I’m someone who can’t watch needles go into skin and he has done an A+ job except for Friday night when I felt some Cetrotide leak down the side of my belly as he was removing the needle.  I freaked out and even cried a little in fear that I was going to ovulate early or that now all would go terribly wrong.     In my crazed paranoia I drew up an ml of sodium chloride and trickled it down my belly to simulate the amount I felt earlier.  It felt like a lot but seems it was only a little according to my extremely scientific calculations.

This sub has provided much support & is a welcome place for info & support outside of those other places with the stupid short hand & garbage. Thank you for that!

Our Story: 
Me 33, Husband 34 - April 2016 = 1 year of trying without success

April: full blood panel workup done & sent husband for SA.

May: full blood panel came back with flying colors, scheduled HSG & husband went for 2nd SA. By end of May we had the news: MFI & I have a blocked tube & the other is most likely blocked. 

Do not pass go, do not collect $200-- straight to RE 

June: Met with RE-- Was told IVF with ICSI was our best option. Call on cycle day 1 when ready to start. 1 week later-- here we go!

July: stims, retrieval & fresh transfer (1 embryo) 

18 retrieved, 17 mature, 15 fertilized
15 at day 3-- 11 at day 5
transfered 1 4AA on day 5 & froze 1 4BB blast
Day 6-- froze 3 more
Totals: 1 transfered, 4 on ice

Beta: positive (holy shit, what?)
Beta 2: HSG not increasing enough, miscarriage indication (fuuuuu)

Call on cycle day 1 when you're ready. Schedule WTF w RE

4 days later-- cd1 & WTF appt with RE

FET cycle, off & running as we speak. Transfer estimated for Sept 13


Positives:

- Husband is supportive & we are ready for whatever outcome we end up with, for now we are anyway.

- We got started FAST & don't feel like we lost any time between the ""1 year"" & getting started. Helps a lot with morale. 

- Very happy with our RE & we are in a big city so we have access to fantastic facilities without long drives.

- Close friend went through 3 retrievals & 5 transfers, my IVF guru & go to for questions, support etc.

- Said friend sold me her leftover stim meds for over 50% off (I did my retrieval for $1k in meds which is ridiculous)

- I had enough leftover & a coworker is starting her first IVF this month. Not only can I sell her my leftovers but I can pass on the discount.

- A friend & neighbor is also going through IVF at the same time as me. We are off by 2 weeks. Her path is different, of course but we meet once a week for dinner & it's amazing to have a friend going through this shit show at the same time.. goes without saying. 

Cons:

- No insurance coverage. FML

- My nurse & I are not compatible at all. I had to send her an email before stims to level set. 

- NOT prepared for the numbers to drop so much from day 3 to 5...

- Not educated/told/given the option of PGS prior to retrieval & wish we would have done that once the RE told us 1/3 of our embryos wouldn't work based on my age. 

- Going to visit my brothers  for 4 days in 2 weeks -- one has a 1 year old, another has a 1 month old..... And we are splitting the trip between both brother's houses...and I'll be doing injections and one of my SILs is nosey as hell

- Boss doesn't know I'm doing IVF so leaving for all the appointments is.... tricky

- My family has said some ridiculous things to me (whose hasn't!)

- I'm scared we will run out of embryos if we get pregnant on this next FET (or the next one) then be left with 2 embryos & wanting a second kid when I am 35+ & past ET prime...",[],False,,0,False,"Long Time Listener, First Time Caller (Intro)",[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_4wgrei,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,False,1,,self,False,,{},,True,,1470532621.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve been lurking since we visited the RE for the first time in June.

<p>Our Story: 
Me 33, Husband 34 - April 2016 = 1 year of trying without success</p>

<p>April: full blood panel workup done &amp; sent husband for SA.</p>

<p>May: full blood panel came back with flying colors, scheduled HSG &amp; husband went for 2nd SA. By end of May we had the news: MFI &amp; I have a blocked tube &amp; the other is most likely blocked. </p>

<p>Do not pass go, do not collect $200-- straight to RE </p>

<p>June: Met with RE-- Was told IVF with ICSI was our best option. Call on cycle day 1 when ready to start. 1 week later-- here we go!</p>

<p>July: stims, retrieval &amp; fresh transfer (1 embryo) </p>

<p>18 retrieved, 17 mature, 15 fertilized
15 at day 3-- 11 at day 5
transfered 1 4AA on day 5 &amp; froze 1 4BB blast
Day 6-- froze 3 more
Totals: 1 transfered, 4 on ice</p>

<p>Beta: positive (holy shit, what?)
Beta 2: HSG not increasing enough, miscarriage indication (fuuuuu)</p>

<p>Call on cycle day 1 when you&#39;re ready. Schedule WTF w RE</p>

<p>4 days later-- cd1 &amp; WTF appt with RE</p>

<p>FET cycle, off &amp; running as we speak. Transfer estimated for Sept 13</p>

<p>Positives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Husband is supportive &amp; we are ready for whatever outcome we end up with, for now we are anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>We got started FAST &amp; don&#39;t feel like we lost any time between the &quot;1 year&quot; &amp; getting started. Helps a lot with morale. </p></li>
