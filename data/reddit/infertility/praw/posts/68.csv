First time poster here, and looking for opinion or thoughts on our current IVF cycle. I hope this is acceptable to post here.

DOR - Secondary Infertility. 
IVF #1 resulted in 1 embryo PGS tested no result (13 retrieved, 9 mature, 8 fertilized)
Protocol was HGH + antagonist (150menopur, 375 gonal-f)

We are currently in transfer prep mode and I was informed today that my estrogen dropped significantly and my lining is no longer “organized”. I’m currently sporting 4 estrogen (.1) patches and inserting one estrogen 2mg tablet vaginally and tonight is my last night of Lupron. My RE would like to put it on hold and try a stimulated transfer protocol. Meaning, a stim cycle to encourage natural estrogen production and trigger and then transfer our embryo. She feels that comparatively my lining is substandard from previous u/s and does not recommend proceeding (although she is not refusing it).  I have never heard of a stimulated transfer cycle and am trying to wrap my head around this. Also questioning if we are already doing a stim cycle why aren’t we just doing another IVF cycle and transferring our frozen embryo after retrieval and any eggs retrieved we then have as a back-up in the event our embryo does not work out. We have insurance coverage after the first of the year and I cannot help but feel we are being played. I do trust our RE, but there have been two very questionable financial situations which have my husband and I questioning....are they just trying to get another cycle out of us? Or is this just my anger that my body isn’t responding how I planned. 

Our current plan is to retest my levels tomorrow and u/s and make the call (all other meds start tomorrow morning) but I cannot imagine my uterus will be reorganized by morning.

We are in the midst of Secondary Infertility treatment (I had my son after a successful fresh transfer. This is our first rodeo with FET's).  So far we have had one medicated FET of a PGS tested normal embryo that resulted in a negative beta. So, just nothing.  Our RE said that we could do a natural cycle next or do a mock medicated cycle with an ERA.  We only have 1 girl embryo left, so I chose the ERA. 

However, I am doubting that decision or at least curious on if I should have chosen the natural cycle.  I do not have problems with my lining or with ovulating (our issue seemed to be more that my husband's sperm gets confused about how to get into the egg).  I am SO curious as to why a fresh cycle worked for me and now I feel like maybe it is the medicated FET that doesn't work. 

I am also terrified of the pain of the ERA. But, I know that the ERA would give a good answer regarding implantation timing and at least we could figure out if that was the issue. But, once we have that answer, I would be doing a medicated cycle again. 

Thoughts? Has anyone chosen a natural FET over a medicated one and had drastically different results  (especially if your issue was implantation timing).  The timing is the only thing our RE can see that made the first transfer fail (especially since it was a PGS embryo). 

I think it is too late for me to turn back now because I started Estrace yesterday, but I am curious on what others think.

My clinic batches patients so most (if not all) patients are started on BCP to sync us up with our scheduled ER week.  I've read that patients can be on BCP for anywhere from 10 to 21 days, and even up to 42 days before starting stims.

But how long is too long to be on BCP?  

I have DOR (AMH 2.7, AFC 14, FSH 12.3) and am concerned about oversupression.  I have had good response (and even overstimulation) to prior injectable + IUI cycles, but those cycles were not preceded by weeks of BCP.  I just finished 21 days of BCP due to a cancelled cycle with cysts.  My ER week is 2nd week of Feb.  My RE said I will likely start BCP soon and continue it through Feb (probably with breaks between packs).  That means I will have taken ~3 months of BCP prior to starting stims.  This does NOT sound right to me.

I know several others on this sub have shared their experience and success/frustration with BCP in their protocols, but I didn't see significant discussion regarding the duration of BCP.  I asked about estrogen priming too, but my RE didn't really think I needed it.  Any advice or insight is appreciated.

I've only done one IVF cycle, but apparently I was very nearly cancelled and my doctor believes it will happen next time if we continue the same protocol. 

I respond tooooo well to the stims as I have lots of little follicles and polycystic ovaries. Due to this they want me to do a down reg cycle under general anaesthesia next time. My concerns are:

1) My first cycle I was under sedation, the GA is so they can collect more eggs but it will cost another $1600 more

2) The doctor said although she recommends this over trying the same IVF regime I did the first time, it's very likely I won't get any transfer out of it and will have to freeze embryos.

3) Because of 2) this means forking out more $$$$$ for another cycle for a frozen transfer..

4) The down reg cycle will make me very sick apparently

5) It seems like more of an expensive gamble and a LOT to put my body through for under 30% chance of success at age 36

I have been getting acupuncture done by a fertility TCM specialist in my area and have been chatting to her about trying a TCM/natural approach. I have recovered from hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) and she has seen hundreds of women with HA or PCOS (or both) and has had much success.

My husband and I just finished our first unsuccessful IVF. We only had 1 embryo.

Before the whole cycle, my husband saw a urologist who didn't seem very good. He was like ""everything's fine!"" whereas my RE thinks MFI may be a problem since our embryos arrested around day 3 or whenever it is that the sperm kicks in. Husband doesn't have a varicocele.

Here's his concerning stats:

* Morphology 0
* DFI 21 (borderline)
* OSA (Oxidative stress adduct) 4.5 (abnormal)

 I hate that we have lost 6 babies.  

&#x200B;

I never noticed how every single TV show and commercial has babies or pregnant women.  I hate them all.  I hate that it's so easy for most of the population to crank babies out.  I hate that every time we see a baby in public that it brings back every single bad memory.  I hate the idea that for the rest of our lives, if my wife and I are unable to have a baby, we will be constantly reminded of that fact every time we turn on the TV, or go out in public, or listen to co-workers and their amazing lives full of babies and pregnancy.  I hate that there's a very real chance I may never hold my own child or watch it grow up or do any of the things that seem so commonplace to everyone else.  I hate every news story about a baby or child being abused when i know that we would be much better parents than the evil people that do evil things to babies or children.  

&#x200B;

I hate that our marriage of 3 years has been full of either trying to get pregnant, being pregnant, terminating a lost pregnancy, getting over a lost pregnancy, or being afraid of the next pregnancy.  I hate that the joy of life is gone,  I hate that my wife has had the happiness stripped from her life, I hate that she has given so freely of her body and mind so many times and has nothing to show for it.  

&#x200B;

I hate that I am 42 and even if we have a child I will be over 60 when it goes to college.  I hate that my brother had a baby on his first try and it is the same age as our 6th miscarriage would have been if it had lived, and if we never have our own, then I am doomed to a life of watching it grow up and thinking about how that's how old ours would be, those are the things it would be doing if it lived.  

&#x200B;

I hate that our last baby was healthy and had a heartbeat, until the next ultrasound when the heartbeat slowed, and then the next one where it was nowhere to be found.  I hate that it was big enough to see a head and body forming and hold in our hands briefly after the cytotec did what it was designed to do.  I hate that we flushed it down the toilet in a panic of blood and tears.  I hate that we sent 'tissue' from the 5th one off to a lab to be disintegrated into a cloud of science and genetic material.    I hate that miscarriage is so common that my wife has kept an hour-by-hour diary of every one of the miscarriages so she knows what to expect and what is 'normal' as the cytotec rips the last shred of hope from her body yet again. 

&#x200B;

I hate that now we have to do IVF to even have a 50/50 shot at having a baby.    I hate that the money we have worked hard to save for a baby will all be gone to pay for IVF.    

&#x200B;

I  hate that we have to pretend that everything is normal and our lives are fine.  I hate that i can't touch her or make love to her because we are afraid of getting an unplanned pregnancy.  I hate that sex became mechanical and then absent as we figure out the IVF process.

&#x200B;

I hate the tests, the phone calls, the Dr.'s office.  I hate the word ultrasound, I hate seeing an ultrasound, I hate that this has been our life for years now.

Intro: I’m 32, husband 34 (I’ll work on figuring out flare). In 2016 we got pregnant our second month of trying (I remember thinking “wow, that was easy”. Ugh.) We had an early MMC, and I had a D&C. I was told everything went fine, I felt okay after, but never got my period back. Strong cramping each month, no bleeding. Months passed. Finally after doctors telling me it was very rare to get scaring after such an early MC and first D&C, I was diagnosed with Ashermans. Complete scaring of lower cervix. My RE at the time told me it could not be fixed, and I’d never be able to get pregnant. I joined an Ashermans support group, and made an appointment with one of the top doctors for treating Ashermans (he was seriously amazing). He was able to clear my scar tissue, and gave us the all clear to try again.   A year later and still trying, go to a new RE. All my tests come back normal, scaring is gone, but now we were diagnosed with MFI. We are going straight to IVF with ICSI, because I have some insurance coverage and insurance approved skipping IUI.

Neither can I figure out how to phrase it into a ""Googleable"" question in order to attempt to solve it. So, at 12:12 am I come to my fellow Infertilites for some semblance of resolve -- y'all seem to be the only ones who really *get* what it means to be ""grasping at straws"" here. 


Here it is : The more tests/bloodwork/genetic screenings/blahblahblahblah we seem to do, the more ""normal"" we seem to become. I understand that my need for a ""reason"" is why I think these things, but that doesn't get rid of the thoughts. I wish more than anything to have something to work towards, instead I just create bizarre scenarios like the one below....


What if Mr.ApolloBollo on one side of the room were to produce 25 equally amazing sperm (he seems to have no problem doing this in real life, so not much of a stretch) -- all things being equal -- and on the other side of the room we have 25 amazingly beautiful eggs. They are perfectly perfect in all the ways that matter. Now, let's say that these 25 sperm meet up with these 25 eggs and all our conditions are beyond ideal (these are the Olympians of Sperm and Egg). Theoretically, all 25 should be fertilized given all of our conditions and variables are beyond perfection, but we know that really won't happen given that life is a shitbox full of shitty shits.  


Does Mr.ApolloBollo's sperm have preferences? Like, does Egg #12 appeal to Him more than Egg #22 for whatever reason? Is there something that compels them to meet up and fertilize and produce a viable pregnancy, whereas Egg #22 just isn't his type? Or is this all just a crapshoot -- do they each have just as good of odds as the next? In life we have personality preferences, so why can't our eggs/sperm share the same ability to make choices and prefer A over B? Am I anthropomorphizing Sperm and Egg? 

The further I get from a ""why"" in regards to our inability to successfully get knocked up, the more my mind comes up with these ideas -- what if we just aren't compatible in that way? It seems possible, but this whole scenario is kind of reminiscent of Eugenics and not at all easy to test, so maybe I am just grasping at straws to figure out some kind of plausible reason why we are the way we are. Mr.ApolloBollo is my absolute Person. He was made for me, and I for him --- but maybe our genes are on a different page?

UPDATE: Ralph is benign! Already have an appointment with a surgeon scheduled for next Thursday. So ready to move forward and I’ve never looked forward to someone going in the back door more! 


I cannot put into words all of the events of the last 6 months and capture the true essence of everything that has occurred. That being said I want people to see that sometimes something real fucking shitty can happen but it’s occurrence can somehow be for the best in some weird “the universe has aligned” type of bullshit 

1. August 24th 2018 - miscarry at 6 weeks with a donor egg embryo. 

2. August 26th 2018 - go in for a d&c where a heart arrhythmia is discovered. Anesthesia is the best thing ever. 

3. Early September - go to a cardiologist, do a whole bunch of tests to determine the arrhythmia is not cardiac related. Cool. So I’m anxious even when I’m under anesthesia. 

4. Late October still no period after d&c. I start questioning whether I could have asherman’s. Go in for bloodwork, saline sonogram, etc. RE determines my body never reset after the miscarriage puts me on BC but I start experiencing a ton of pain in my abdomen so I’m not convinced so I start taking serrapeptase to reduce potential scar tissue. 

5. October 27th 2018 - end up in the ER as my acupuncturist thinks the pain may  appendicitis. It’s not. It’s colitis. Go home and I’m essentially better in a couple days and I blame the serrapeptase.

7. November 18th - start experiencing more gastro stuff so make an appt just for shits and giggles (pun intended). They suggest Crohns but say I need a colonoscopy. I’m 39. 

8. November 29th 2018 - colonoscopy day. Probably a huge waste of time. There’s NO WAY I have crohn’s. Anesthesia is still great. Arrhythmia resurfaced. We’ll just call that anxiety. WHAT I DO HAVE AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 39 IS A LARGE POLYP IN MY RECTUM!!!!

9. Same day, little high, but the doctor says “thank god you did this or you would have been one of those 42 year old tragedies we hear about.” 

Now I get to go see a proctologist to get Ralph (the polyp) excised. 

I’ve done the research. Had I not caught this there is a very real possibility I would not have had an opportunity to watch that baby grow up. I’m not happy that any of this happened.

Since I cannot fall asleep tonight, I started thinking about whether we should have done PGS. I was chatting with someone who works in a fertility lab today and she mentioned that a very small number of people opt for the testing in this city vs the one she was at before. This town is more religious. We are not against it, but chose not to due to added cost and perhaps fear.

This town is more religious. We are not against it, but chose not to due to added cost and perhaps fear.

Details:
My husband and I are on TTC cycle 4. I have suspected PCOS based on severe acne and ultrasound. BBT shows that I ovulate. Cycles are irregular and 27-41 days. I’m also new to the American medical system. Before we moved to the USA, we tried for about 6 cycles. Then we used condoms for 2 years. I’m 32 now.

My doctor gave me a referral for an RE, but suggested we try for a few more cycles to make sure I ovulate. Doctors at home are slow to refer, and only do if they 100% feel it’s required. Here they ask me “what would you like me to do?” and it makes me feel like I’m being a pushy patient when I just ask a question, or they throw referrals at me. I’ve never felt like I’ve needed to advocate for myself for the first 30 years of my life, so I don’t know when to panic, when to be pushy, and when to chill. That itself causes me to panic! I’m used to doctors taking the lead. Now, I don’t know if it’s a serious referral or they are trying to placate me.

I ordered my own CD3 tests hoping it would give me peace with waiting for a bit, or at least data to resolve the panic/chill state going on in my brain. My fasting DHEA came back at 64 ug/dL and the lab says 84.8-378 is normal. Everything else was normal but my LH:FSH ratio is 1.5. Is this something that should prompt me to go the RE sooner?

I  use to mostly lurk on this subreddit years ago when my partner and I initially started trying to conceive.  I am 33 F, partner 32 M.  Married for 11 years and we have never used birth control and never had a pregnancy.  We started really trying in 2013.  After a year we sought treatment and underwent 3 clomid cycles, 9 letrozole cycles (3 with trigger) all with timed intercourse.  My partner has underwent 3 SA's (everytime we have moved since trying - Army) and they have all come back normal.  HSG showed open tubes.  I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2014 when we started our first medicated cycles and was on Metformin for one year which I hated as it made me sick as a dog.  I stopped Metformin when we stopped officially trying for awhile to give  my body a break.  We moved to a new state and I took some time away from trying / monitoring because I needed a mental break and decided to pursue grad school.  

Fast forward to now, I am in a new city and connected with a new RE.  In preparation for an IUI last month, the ultrasound revealed a 5 cm endometrioma on my left ovary as well as multiple fibroids around my uterus.  I was greatly surprised by this as I've never been told I've had endometriosis and have always equated my pelvic pain to PCOS.  My RE said we could move forward with the IUI (we used 50 units of gonal F, 5 mg Letrozole, trigger shot & I am currently on 400 mg progesterone capsules  - beta on Monday).  I produced 3 follicles at 15, 17 & 18 in response to those medications.   
 I am not feeling hopeful about this cycle (been peeing on wondfo's all week) and am questioning if it was even a good idea to proceed.  I am worried that I might have severe endometriosis that should be addressed before we move forward with another cycle if this one does not succeed.  So I guess I am looking for support / advice here.  How hard would you push a possible laparoscopic surgery to address the endo?  How worried should I be about fibroids?

Cycles were clockwork until July when I had a hysteroscopy to remove some endometrial polyps. I had a 21 day cycle that month, then 47 days, when I learned I had two 5cm cysts (one on each ovary.) One resolved, then we drained the other one in office. They came back immediately, and 2 weeks ago I had a laparoscopy to remove the cysts fully. I started progesterone (200mg for 5 days) 2 days after surgery, and then waited a week. No period.

I'm now on my 3rd day of taking 400mg to see if that forces a withdrawal bleed. Since my cycles went haywire in July, every ultrasound has showed a thick lining, so I'm really hoping this works. RE wants to start clomid on CD 5 and ""not waste anymore time,"" even though when we started this process we talked about doing a few natural cycles to reduce the risk of multiples.

I'm so irritable and frustrated. It's so hard for me to believe it's just a coincidence everything went awry when we started poking around in there. AMH was .374 in May, FSH 9.9. I'm hoping my ovaries didn't cough up their last few eggs while we were trying to get things going? On top of it, I'm normally content to be doing this alone, but right now I'm on a shame spiral about not being able to do this the ""normal"" way, with free sperm. I'm so angry at myself somehow for not being able to get a partner, and thus not being able to try this whole time. When I thought about becoming a single mother by choice, I couldn't have imagined having to try so hard while simultaneously not being able to try at all.

Anyway, /endrant. Anyone have luck getting their uterus to bleed with a 400mg dose of progesterone?

I am a 33 year old female who has been trying to start a family with my husband for nearly 2 years. I have PCOS, Endometriosis and the AMH levels of a 40 year old. Husband has clean bill of health and no known problems. We have no idea what the issue is - could be any or all of the above. No achieved pregnancies at all as of yet. 

PCOS: I am on Metformin which keeps my weight steady but i struggle to lose anything at all. Currently I am 5lbs into obese category which means I am not eligible for NHS funding for IVF (which I have been told is my best chance). 

I have been trying for months but my weight just will not shift. I’ve signed up to a 10’week PCOS challenge starting January to try again to lose some weight, but I’m terrified it will just be another failure on my part and leave me with even more guilt. 

Endometriosis: I had a hycosy which suggested my left tube is stuck in the wrong place and subsequently blocked. Also get a lot of pain on that side regularly so I am booked in for a laparoscopy a weekday on Saturday. 

I am hoping they’ll sort it out as much as possible but also concerned since previous fertility consultant told me to avoid lap at all costs “best not to fiddle - go straight to IVF). Consistently get inconsistent advice which is not helpful - next consultant said it would increase chances both naturally and with IVF hence why we are going for it...but worried in case it makes things worse.

AMH: I was frustrated by the two issues above, but felt like I could at least try to do something to fix them! I have no idea if I’m just left with dodgy eggs and all efforts are in vain because it’s too late anyway!!! Mentally this is the hardest one for me to come to terms with.

Another pair of good friends sent me a scan photo thise evening and it’s just pushed me some what over the edge. I don’t want to be jealous or upset anymore. I am slowly losing hope though - with every pregnancy announcement I feel more like I can never imagine it happening for us. 

I sometimes feel like I don’t know where to start to try and fix it all and I don’t know if I even can! How do I keep hope going - it’s just too painful! I feel like I would feel better if I could be proactive - and I’m trying to be - but regular failures are making me rebellious and struggling to start again...again! Any thoughts most welcome...

We tried for 18 months before we finally got on Clomid. Clomid didn't work, i maxed out the dosage, my doctor labeling me as a Clomid failure after 4 months. Next, I had to wait 6 weeks to take the injectibles class, then another few weeks to get a period and try. Next, i maxed out menopur within two months and was deemed a menopur failure. Finally started Gonal F for the first time this past cycle. Finally produced some small follicles, and then the Doctor increased the dosage and I got TOO many, i had 8 mature and 2 more almost mature. We decided to skip the IUI this time, as 10 babies is a bit scary, LOL. It's been an exhausting year!

I'm really frustrated that my cycle was cancelled 2 weeks ago.  And despite 2 weeks of BCP since then I have 5 cysts remaining on one of my ovaries.  This is the first time I have ever had a cyst, let alone 5.  

We had 10 measurable follicles and several smaller ones (8 mature) from Menopur x 8 days , which is why the IUI was cancelled. To say I was overstimulated is an understatement.  But now 5 follicles/cysts are still hanging around and a few of them are \~2cm in size.  We had planned to squeeze in one more IUI cycle before moving on to IVF, but now that plan is out the window.  I know it has only been 2 weeks on BCP, but how are there so many large cysts still hanging around?!?  Feeling panicked that IVF could be delayed (again) due to these persistent cysts.

Has anyone else gone through this?  How many cysts did you have?  How long did you have to take BCP?  How long did it take for the cysts to resolve?  Did you end up having them aspirated?

We started with 8 eggs, 7 fertilized, 2 made it to the day 5 blastocyst stage and 2 are still hanging out and growing with the chance of being frozen. My question pertains to the 2 we had at the day 5 blastocyst stage. Our doctor noted that they both had fragmentation and she wasn’t super optimistic about them being successful so she suggested we place both. We did the placement, but now that I’ve had time to think I’ve come up with the following questions:


-what causes this fragmentation to occur? 

-will this always happen then if we try to do more rounds of ivf in the future? 

-Is there anything we can do to prevent it? 

-what are our odds of becoming pregnant this cycle? 

-if we do become pregnant is there a greater risk for birth defects and such? 


I’m sure my doctor will answer as well but just wondering if others have input in the time being. Thanks!

I just wanted to make a post about PIO tips learned the hard way. Some people here gave me tips that helped enormously so I am spreading the knowledge and love!

1. If you have someone giving you the shot, then lay down pigeon toed and hug a pillow. (If you are doing it yourself, you are a badass! Also, I heard if you are doing it yourself to put all your weight on the leg not getting the shot and do it in a bathroom with a mirror.)
2. Heat the shot with a heating pad (or run it under hot water for 10 seconds.)
3. Heat the injection site with a heating pad (Some people use a numbing cream or ice it. I do not.)
4. Follow the directions for the shot, put it in (edit: put it in quickly like a dart), check for blood, then very very slowly inject it.
5. Massage and heat the area afterwards.
6. Then very important, walk, squat, climb stairs, go on a treadmill, take a hot shower after, do anything to move that muscle. If you don't you are in a world of soreness in a few hours.

Please add anything I forgot, or take down if it is not an allowed post.

Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I typically lurk but I wanted to reach out because I could use some guidance on how to proceed going forward. We had a complete shitshow of an IVF cycle and we're lost as to how to proceed.

&#x200B;

Quick background, my husband and I are both 30 and have been trying for 2.5 years. We've never had a positive test in this time. While our doctors have considered us unexplained there have been a few things that could contribute. On my end AMH and AFC are great, I ovulated normally and have consistent 30 day cycles, and I had a small polyp removed earlier this year. Elevated prolactin was discovered on one blood test and has since been controlled with cabergoline. I suspect some degree of endo due to increasingly painful periods since stopping the pill. For my husband, he has low morphology with most recent one around 5%, and DNA frag of 30% down from 33%. A semen culture grew some stuff which he took a round of antibiotics. A repeat still showed E coli growing, urologist recommended another antibiotic but this came after our retrieval.

&#x200B;

Before our IVF we did 2 letrozole + TI cycles, letrozole with IUI, then injectables + IUI, all negative. For IVF I did a standard antagonist cycle, with BCP for 16 days, and stimmed a total of 9 days with 150u gonal f (doc was concerned about overstimulation) with 75u menopur. After a few days menopur was increased to 3 vials. Did cetrotide for 4 days then did a dual lupron and HcG trigger. E2 was around 3800 by retrieval. We had 26 eggs retrieved, and we were so excited! However the following day we got the news that only 3 fertilized with ICSI. Yes that's correct, just 3. Out of the 26 eggs, only 3 were mature enough to be fertilized. We were obviously beside ourselves, and our doctor later admitted that he triggered us earlier because he was concerned about OHSS. I'm pretty sure I still had some degree of it because I felt absolutely terrible for several days after the retrieval. From the 3 eggs, only one made it to day 5 (a 4BC) which we froze, and skipped PGS.

&#x200B;

For FET, I did oral estrace 3 times a day, then started PIO and prednisone 5 days before transfer. Lining was only around 8mm which is a way lower than it typically is on a natural cycle. Transfer went fine and I continued meds. Yesterday was beta and it was a hard negative, no implantation.

&#x200B;

We are devastated. We always expected to have to possibly do more than one transfer, but to have 26 eggs and only end up with one ok embryo and have no sign of implantation is pretty messed up. On top of all this, we used all our insurance money. Luckily, husband's family has kindly offered to help out for another retrieval.

&#x200B;

I suppose I'm looking for advice on what to do next. I'm not well versed with all the protocols so I'm not sure which to look into in terms of producing a better batch of mature eggs? Also would like to look into ERA and receptiva to test endo angle? I feel like something is wrong in terms of implantation since we've never had a hint of a positive so what can help with improving this? Since our doctor fucked up so badly I would not mind any recommendations for NYC docs/clinics that can actually produce results. I'm honestly not sure if I want to have a WTF meeting with this guy because we're really upset.

&#x200B;

<p>We are devastated. We always expected to have to possibly do more than one transfer, but to have 26 eggs and only end up with one ok embryo and have no sign of implantation is pretty messed up. On top of all this, we used all our insurance money. Luckily, husband&#39;s family has kindly offered to help out for another retrieval.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;m looking for advice on what to do next. I&#39;m not well versed with all the protocols so I&#39;m not sure which to look into in terms of producing a better batch of mature eggs? Also would like to look into ERA and receptiva to test endo angle? I feel like something is wrong in terms of implantation since we&#39;ve never had a hint of a positive so what can help with improving this? Since our doctor fucked up so badly I would not mind any recommendations for NYC docs/clinics that can actually produce results. I&#39;m honestly not sure if I want to have a WTF meeting with this guy because we&#39;re really upset.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>tl,dr: 2.5 years trying with no positives, IVF cycle resulted in 26 eggs, 3 mature, and only 1 ok embryo, FET failed. Looking for advice on different protocols and testing to do to improve egg maturity and increase chances of implantation.</p>

Reluctantly scheduling IVF #1 for early 2019 at SIRM NY. We’re more or less unexplained - my husband has low normal morphology and I have slightly long (32-34 day) cycles. Everything else is textbook. I’ve never been pregnant and we’re going on 4 years off the pill, 3 years since my cycle returned with regularity. 

Our plan was to try 2 more IUI’s while waiting for IVF. We did 3 Letrozole cycles, the last with IUI earlier this year - but insurance denied us the opportunity to do it without meds. Incredibly strange as I know several people who had no issue getting natural IUIs covered - and I actually have unlimited medicated IUIs at 100% (realize I’m lucky to have this coverage - UHC Oxford). Letrozole made me batty so I’m not really into trying Clomid, which my dr suggested. 

So our options for Dec/Jan are now:

1) Natural IUI out of pocket at $850 a pop
2) Get prescription for Clomid and not take it just so insurance will cover and tell my doctor (unsure how she’d react)
3) same as #2 but NOT tell my doctor
4) same as #2 but actually take the Clomid 
5) ask to try injectables which might help with diagnostics for IVF 
6) just try naturally (I’m on cycle 27, so this is highly unlikely to work) and gear up for IVF

WWYD? Really appreciate your honest gut feeling answers, I’m not getting much help from my husband or my clinic to decide how best to move forward.  

Also, for those who were in the same stage as where I am, did you get multiple IVF consults? I also have a call in to Dr Sami David - he’s expensive but certainly less than IVF so figure it might be worth a shot to try some of his voodoo.

189,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"My husband is infertile. Inherited genetic disorder from BOTH parents that went undiscovered until after we got married. Healthy sperm exists but it’s blocked from reaching the semen. IVF is the only treatment option, which we tried once and failed. We found the entire experience of IVF off putting for a million reasons, and didn’t want to try again. I never really wanted kids so while I was disappointed, I wasn’t hugely devastated, and he seemed to accept his diagnosis. We put it out of our minds, time passed and we stopped thinking about it. 

Then something happened and everything turned upside down. My sister in law recently announced she is pregnant. I’ve had other friends and family become pregnant since our own ordeal, and I’ve never minded. I felt a bit self conscious maybe, but that’s about it. For some reason, this pregnancy has greatly upset me. I feel angry. It reminds me of a really painful, invasive, confusing and sad time in my life, and while I’m happy for her, I’m sad for my husband and for myself. My husband is infertile while his sister isn’t, and the elephant in the room that time has helped to quiet has now just erupted. What also makes it harder is that my mother in law told me after we discovered my spouse’s disorder that she felt “no guilt whatsoever” because she didn’t know she had the gene. While I don’t expect her to crucify herself, her comment horrified me and I never got over it. My husband’s father, on the other hand, was devastated over the news, and didn’t come out of his study for two days. Again, I don’t want people to punish themselves but his reaction at least felt more respectful and honoring of our situation.

Since my SIL’s announcement, I have avoided her whenever possible. I was obligated to attend a birthday dinner for my spouse’s brother (who has refused to test to see if he is also infertile), where I would see my sister in law for the first time since her announcement. I had hoped there would be a sense of awareness within my husband’s family and sensitivity and tact would prevail. It did not. We weren’t even fully sat down before the baby talk started between the two fertile siblings. I wanted to die. Fortunately, my spouse deftly changed the subject and it took the heat off for a while, until his sister asks, “Do you guys want to guess the gender of the baby?” My husband deadpanned, “No,” which seemed to catch her off guard. When she told us it was a girl, we said in a very flat tone, “Congratulations.” My prayer was that would be a clear signal to the rest of the family we were simply there to celebrate a birthday and weren’t interested in baby talk.

Since that night (a couple of months ago) things have been quiet. My husband’s parents haven’t discussed anything with us; I think his father is keenly aware and knows this is just too delicate a subject, my husband’s mother, I think, is clued in as well because she doesn’t talk about it at all to me. A small comment once or twice about what kind of wine to get my sister in law for her first glass after the baby is born. But nothing beyond that. In general I enjoy a polite yet emotionally distant relationship with my in laws, which serves very well usually. 

Then last week I receive a invitation to the baby shower in the mail. Again all my emotions came flooding back. Anger, sadness, a twinge of jealousy, and outrage. Also anxiety and despair. Up until now I haven’t had to see my SIL so there really hasn’t been much opportunity to confirm or deny the existence of an issue, but there most definitely is one, and it will come to light whether I attend or decline. The former by my clear discomfort and the latter by my absence. My sense is they must be aware to some degree, because neither my MIL or SIL have mentioned a word about the baby shower to me, and I’m usually the one who plans all the special events in the family. I helped coordinate her bridal shower. But I’m still worried somehow they aren’t clued in, and if I decline it will open Pandora’s box. My absence will be very obvious, because I’m close family. 

I’ve talked to my spouse about it who explains  he’s not as upset about it as I am and had made peace with not being a father. He doesn’t blame his parents for his misfortune and I understand. How could he? He wouldn’t be here otherwise. I wish I could be as well adjusted as he but I do blame them. And it makes me angry that they’ll be celebrating their daughter while their son has no fucking ability to father children. And I’m sorry if saying that doesn’t make me a bigger person but it’s a fucking outrage, and none of them could possibly imagine what we went through and the little daily reminders since. And the most tragic part of all is that this couldn’t have happened to a kinder, gentler man. It breaks my heart.

My husband supports my feelings and takes the position that we are a unified front. He thinks he should confront his family and let them know we’re happy for his sister but it brings up a painful time in our lives and people need to respect that and tone it down. But at the same time, I know that’s unfair and this baby isn’t going anywhere. Can I really dodge them forever? Of course not. But I really can’t seem to cope. 

I’ve been an emotional mess. I’ve considered going back to IVF to somehow solve “the problem” but every time we discuss it neither of us are really excited to go through it again. It was a horrible experience compounded by the irony that I am fertile with no medical issues.
And every time you go through a round, your odds of developing disease increase. However it’s one thing to say you don’t want kids, it’s another to be told you can’t. I can get pregnant just fine on my own and it’s weird knowing that. It just seems wrong to put my body through that when I don’t have to. But I’m also getting closer to an age where my own fertility will eventually be in decline. Neither of us want to adopt or use a donor. 

My feelings are completely all over the place. It’s forcing me to confront a lot of painful things, private things, my marriage, my in laws, my reproductive future. I’m dreading Christmas because my in laws are very wealthy and it’s always a million gifts and now my mother in law has this new baby to lavish, and I can NOT sit there and watch my sister in law open baby gifts that my husband and I likely never will. My husband feels strongly that he should tell them to do any baby presents before we arrive. I’m conflicted because I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. 

Please tell me if I’m crazy. Am I being unreasonable? What do I do? How do I handle this? I’m not coping well. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

TL;DR - My husband inherited infertility from both parents but his sister is pregnant. I’m angry and I don’t know what to do. I feel it’s totally unfair that everyone is celebrating my sister in law’s pregnancy and my husband and I are ghosts at the feast. I also literally don’t ever want to be around this baby which I know is impossible.

192,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi everyone.  I've lurked on Reddit for years but recently made an account to specifically be able to post on this sub.  My husband and I have been together since 2005 and began trying as soon as we got married in June 2017.  After no luck, we went to the doctor in August 2018 to see what was up.  Everything came back ""normal"" for the both of us so we made a plan to do 3 IUIs and then move to IVF.  I never even considered that IVF would be something we would ever get to.   Our first IUI was scheduled for the end of August.  I took 50mg Clomid on CD3-CD7 and trigger shot, back to back IUIs two mornings in a row.  I was 100% convinced that this was going to result in a pregnancy because there was nothing ""wrong"" with either of us and I just assumed we needed a little boost.  Man, was I naive!!  I got my period the morning I was scheduled for my first beta test and was devastated.  So round 2 started that day.  Did everything the same -- 50mg Clomid w/ trigger shot and back to back IUIs.  Got my period 2 days before beta.  Started round 3.  This time they upped my Clomid to 100mg w/ trigger shot and 2 IUIs.  Nothing again.  

At this point, my husband and I assumed we would be moving to IVF.  The doctor said it would take 10-14 days for the insurance to approve IVF and asked if I wanted to take the month off or do anther IUI.  I chose to take the month off, and after I hung up the phone felt an immense sense of relief.... Short lived relief.

I&#39;ve lurked on Reddit for years but recently made an account to specifically be able to post on this sub.  My husband and I have been together since 2005 and began trying as soon as we got married in June 2017.  After no luck, we went to the doctor in August 2018 to see what was up.  Everything came back &quot;normal&quot; for the both of us so we made a plan to do 3 IUIs and then move to IVF.  I never even considered that IVF would be something we would ever get to.   Our first IUI was scheduled for the end of August.  I took 50mg Clomid on CD3-CD7 and trigger shot, back to back IUIs two mornings in a row.  I was 100% convinced that this was going to result in a pregnancy because there was nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with either of us and I just assumed we needed a little boost.  Man, was I naive!!  I got my period the morning I was scheduled for my first beta test and was devastated.  So round 2 started that day.  Did everything the same -- 50mg Clomid w/ trigger shot and back to back IUIs.  Got my period 2 days before beta.  Started round 3.  This time they upped my Clomid to 100mg w/ trigger shot and 2 IUIs.  Nothing again.  </p>

<p>At this point, my husband and I assumed we would be moving to IVF.  The doctor said it would take 10-14 days for the insurance to approve IVF and asked if I wanted to take the month off or do anther IUI.  I chose to take the month off, and after I hung up the phone felt an immense sense of relief.... Short lived relief.  My doctor called the next day and said insurance would not approve IVF until we did IUI with injections (because there was no actual diagnosis of something wrong, they need to go through all other options first).  So IUI round 4 started the next day.  This time I was on 75mg of Follistim for CD3-CD8 and then was upped to 100mg Follistim for CD9-CD13.  Even after all that I only have one follicle measuring at 16 and another at 13 on my left side.   Tomorrow night I am taking my Ovidrel trigger shot and IUI is scheduled for Monday and Tuesday mornings.</p>

Or my friends who never struggled because they say casually cruel things like “Maybe it’s for the best; you felt really ambivalent about it after they passed that tax bill.” (This is a true thing someone tried to say to me a week after announcing her second success.)

I can talk to my friends without kids, because it’s not a threat to them or their senses of self. But they are dwindling. 

So here I am. I guess the background bits to get it out of the way? 

Just turned 31, husband is 30. We started trying in October 2017. When I got my iud removed all my hormones went wonky, I started sleeping 18+ hours a day nearly every day, stopped being able to even take the stairs without crying from exhaustion, my appetite dried up, and I somehow gained 30 lbs in about two months.

I have a short cycle so I hit my 11th cycle back in June or early July. By cycle 9, we decided to start at least doing some preliminary tests since we had hit our out of pocket and wanted to get as much done this calendar year as possible. I had bloodwork done, my husband had an sa. Surprise! My tsh was 3.8, which did not concern my pcp IN THE SLIGHTEST. (She also noted that I was suffering from depression, and had gained no weight.) My husband has low concentration, had low motility, his lh was high, and his T was low. He’s been on Clomid since mid-July. The re was concerned about my tsh and fatigue/weight gain so she put me on levothyroxine. I got through a my friend’s bachelorette and wedding weekends with no naps, which is amazing, so that’s improving every day. 

We’re getting our third iui on Saturday. The first time I ovulated on my own on day cd9 so they had me in on cd10. Last cycle, my follicle was 21mm by cd8 so they had me trigger that night and come in the next day in case my body went on its own. I’ve been on letrozole for each cycle and last month they put me on estrogen during my tww because it turns out my lining doesn’t regenerate as quickly as my egg matures. 

Between all of our social, work, familial, and medical obligations, my husband and I have not had a normal day alone since Oct 7. 

I used to be a preschool/toddler room teacher and started nannying five years ago. This is part of why most of our friends are older with well-established families. My old director asks me if I’m ready to go back to teaching every six months or so and I’m getting to a point where I want to say yes even though I want to keep writing my novel full-time. (A year and a half ago I got an agent and the youngest child I cared for aged out of needing me so I’ve been spending my time doing backup care and writing and now, well, medical appointments.) But I want something in my life that is guaranteed. I am working on a novel that might never sell and trying to do something medically that might never work and if I go back to teaching it’s both comfortable and has a clear forward path. Lead teacher for a year or so again before moving into admin. (I have director certification and my old boss is jonesing to work together in that capacity.) It’s just... hard to swallow.

I wanted to add that we read this sub and marvel at all of you. Driving hours to each appointment, saving every penny, and living through the heartbreak every month. We are so grateful to be in the position we are in, and so motivated by how hard each of you is working toward success. I don’t know how folks do it with a full-time clock-in job but we are amazed and impressed by all of you.

**Results Thread**

The results thread is where your **first** positive beta results (regardless of level), and/or all positive HPT results go. Negative results can go in the results thread or you can post them in the daily threads.

*Any questions or concerns you may have in the time between a positive HPT through second betas go in the results thread.*

The results thread is posted every Sunday. Early in the week the link to the new results thread will be posted in the results link index at the bottom of the ""Read This"" sticky on the top of the page to make it easy to find. I update the sticky manually and sometimes it gets missed for a few days. Feel free to message or tag me to remind me to update it.

**Post-Beta Thread**

The post-beta thread was created after a need was identified for those with positive, yet questionable betas to post if they need support from the community. This thread is stickied to the top of the page for the rest of the week.

People posting in this thread may have actual beta results not rising or dropping (definition of *beta hell*), may be going through an ectopic or blighted ovum (note that on-going miscarriages can be discussed in the daily threads with a TW once the loss has been confirmed by a doctor) or may be anxious and unready to post in IFbabies and need support on an on-going issue. This thread provides a safe space for these members of our community to get support from people who know and care about them without members who may not be in the right place to see these kinds of updates having to see them. To put it bluntly, if the first reaction to your post are “CONGRATULATIONS”, that post does not belong in this thread. It should go in the results thread. 

Post-beta thread was created out of necessity so that those who have truly questionable pregnancies have a place to go that’s not full of well wishes when everything, for them, is up in the air. This thread is not for people who are *worried their initial beta results may be poor and then update that their 9dp5dt beta is 400.*

Positive updates to questionable situations ARE allowed in the post-beta thread. For example: if someone's second beta doesn't rise, or drops, and their third beta is okay, an update within the post-beta thread indicating that all is well and they have a confirmed positive is okay. This is permitted because people participating in the post-beta thread do so knowing that they will be discussing positive pregnancy test results and may see early pregnancy issues/concerns.

After much consultation with this community over a year ago, the above two threads were the best way that we could provide the support and safe spaces needed to all members of our community. We recognize that the first weeks after a positive beta can be anxiety ridden and scary for many of us. The post-beta thread fills this need, while the results thread continues to provide a place for *initial results and congratulations* and consolations as needed.

I'm pursuing ivf/pgd to prevent potentially passing on Huntingtons Disease. I'm 28 with no known fertility issues and on bcp for the last decade. I met with two fertility specialists in my area but now I'm struggling to decide which to choose.


Clinic 1: I picked this clinic initially based on gut feelings. They seemed organized and explained cost, timeline, etc clearly. They also had me jump start the pgd testing, which I'm glad about because it's taking two months to complete. However, I did blood work with them (AMH, FSH, etc) while on BCP and they said it was ok to on the pill. It also sounds like they want me to keep taking the pill up to starting meds since they would be putting me on BCP to start anyway. I've voiced concerns about being on BCP for so long and doing blood work while on the pill but they said it's fine. I also looked at their SART score recently and it's really low. They also don't do many IVFs compared to the other clinic.

Clinic 2: This clinic was harder to schedule with and seemed a little chaotic. They recommended I stop taking BCP and come back after 2 cycles for an ultrasound. They told me not to start the PGD process since we weren't ready. They ordered the same blood work as clinic 1 and told me to stop BCP before getting tests. SART score is significantly higher too. They also do 6x more IVFs than clinic 1.

My PGD test is supposed to be ready in Dec and now I'm questioning if clinic 1 was the right choice. I feel like I got conflicting info from each doctor and don't know what to do. Any advice is really appreciated!

I&#39;ve voiced concerns about being on BCP for so long and doing blood work while on the pill but they said it&#39;s fine. I also looked at their SART score recently and it&#39;s really low. They also don&#39;t do many IVFs compared to the other clinic.</p>

<p>Clinic 2: This clinic was harder to schedule with and seemed a little chaotic. They recommended I stop taking BCP and come back after 2 cycles for an ultrasound. They told me not to start the PGD process since we weren&#39;t ready. They ordered the same blood work as clinic 1 and told me to stop BCP before getting tests. SART score is significantly higher too. They also do 6x more IVFs than clinic 1.</p>

<p>My PGD test is supposed to be ready in Dec and now I&#39;m questioning if clinic 1 was the right choice. I feel like I got conflicting info from each doctor and don&#39;t know what to do. Any advice is really appreciated! </p>

I suffered two known ectopic pregnancies and a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (three total fails). Two were towards the end of my marriage, to which my ex-husband now has a living child that he conceived while I was losing my third pregnancy. It's been two years since the divorce has been finalized. I now have an IUD due to found endometriosis (causing the ectopics) and can't move on. I don't date, I am terrified of being hurt again. I'm terrified of losing more babies. And I just want to give up.   


I'm so unbelievably sick and tired of all of these happy ending stories and people trying to ""spin"" things towards the positive. It's all crap. Everyone wants to ""fix"" it. Or place blame. That second one is always fun when people say, ""what could you have done differently...""  


I absolutely feel alone and terrified. I have no prospects towards the future and little hope. And all anyone can talk about is ""Mom's are awesome"" and ""My kids xyz"".   


To top it all off, I've been looking for a therapist, but can't seem to get any to call me back - apparently everyone has a full practice, or I'm too challenging. Even if some therapist does call me back, I just think they're going to say all of the same crap everyone else has said.   


I hate to say this, but right now it's true for me, I hate pregnant women. 100%. I just do. They break my heart.

I had to use every ounce of tact to keep my thoughts to myself. I would have loved to have told her my story about when I got the first call that I was losing my first baby. Or how during the second loss I ended up in the hospital for a DNC because the doctor didn't want to believe it was ectopic (even though I had a prior ectopic) he had to make me prove it by sucking me dry and calling in a pathologist to ensure it wasn't in my womb and then following up with methotrexate when he was wrong. Or how my third one ended just two days after my positive test... and how she should keep her happiness and joy to her damn self because some of us are drowning in sorrow.   


I don't even know what to do, or where to begin. I just know that it hurts. It's been years, and it hurts so bad.

After getting a referral to Hannam Fertility in Toronto 7 months ago, I finally have been accepted for OHIP funding for IVF!! So far my clinic has been great; the staff is attentive and my doctor (Dr. Garbedian) is very very reassuring and amazing. I have endometriosis and my tubes are blocked and it's been absolutely frustrating waiting for surgery to have it properly removed, to see if my tubes can be unblocked.. but with stage 4 it's very unlikely.

I am going to ask my doctor if I can do a retrieval before surgery, since there is a risk for impacting my ovarian reserve/function for removing the endo cysts from my ovaries. I would be so much less stressed if I knew I had some embryos going into surgery.

I have my phone consult tomorrow with my doctor to discuss a plan but I'm curious about a few things:

1) Now it's my understanding the new OHIP covers 2 medicated cycles, but end after retrieval (whether it was successful or not). Has anyone gone through the new OHIP coverage at all? Did you do one medicated cycle just to see how you would respond, and then used the second one for retrieval (or just went right for the retrieval if you responded well)?

2) I'm also wondering if, because of my surgery, I qualify for Fertility Preservation, as I have a condition that could impact my fertility, but it doesn't sound like it would cover transfers. But the idea of having two covered retrievals sounds beneficial, but not sure if it works that way; can you only get one or the other?

3) is PGS worth it if you have no reason to believe you won't have eggs that are good quality, or considering OHIP covers transfer of every embryo anyways? 

4) Meds. My clinic seems to need upfront for medication... but I am doing all my cycle monitoring locally. I'll have to ask the doctor about this, but how did medication work for you? I should be able to buy my own, or try to put it through insurance right? Did anyone have their insurance cover some or all of their IVF meds? 

5) Anything I should ask my doctor about tomorrow?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance. :)

I'm just starting my first cycle of IVF after four years of unexplained infertility, slight MFI, and lots of long delays (including a six-month waiting period after visiting a country classified as a Zika risk). 

I just started my ovarian stimulation yesterday. It was a hard-fought battle because after a routine Pap came back abnormal, I had a colposcopy that turned up two areas of CIN 2 and 3 (basically cervical abnormalities that could lead to cancer and thus should be removed). I had to get a note from my doctor that it was okay to continue with egg retrieval meds because I had already started Lupron. So, while I can go on with the retrieval, the transfer process is going to have to wait until I get the CIN 2 and 3 areas removed from my cervix.

My hospital offers the LEEP/LLETZ procedure, but my uncle who's an OB told me to look into the use of CO2 laser removal, saying that the recovery time was better and that less cervical tissue is removed because it's more precise (I mean it's a laser!). From some googling, though, it looks like LEEP is preferred because they actually remove tissue that they can later examine, while with the CO2 laser, the offending tissue is just destroyed. So, even though my uncle recommended the laser procedure, I'm inclined to just go with whatever my hospital offers, because adding more complications seems like more than I can handle at the moment. I am so tired of talking to doctors at this point...or, rather, trying to get ahold of my doctors and failing. 

I am wondering if anyone has experience with either of these two procedures, and also how long they waited to attempt the embryo transfer afterward. I have no idea what my schedule is going to look like now.

297,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone. I post a lot over in r/stilltrying but I have posted on here before as well, especially after my first hsg showed both tubes blocked at the proximal end. After I went in for a tubal cannulation and they discovered both tubes we're infact open, and going back through the original images showed that the doctor had made a mistake (there wasn't a proper cover on my cervix possibly due to natothian cysts), I went back to r/stilltrying. But as we're about to hit our 2yr ttc 1yr post start of testing intervention, and as our treatment cycles become more in-depth and complicated I find myself lurking on this sub more and more. I'm 26f, unexplained infertility. We've done three rounds of clomid, two rounds of femara (I do not respond to femara we've discovered, even on the higher doses), and waiting for my period after my first cycle being back on clomid. This was my first cycle with what they considered aggressive monitoring, plus my first cycle with a trigger shot and precautionary progesterone suppositories (prometrium). I had only one dominate follicle this cycle, that went from 15mm CD 12, to 17mm CD 14, to 24mm CD 16. The last ultrasound was done at an ER, and there's question about whether the measurement was accurate but that's another story. I triggered the night of CD16, with only 5mm lining. On CD 12 my lining was measuring at 7.6mm, but the two ultasounds after both showed 5mm lining, the last showing tri pattern. 

Obviously with 5mm lining there never was any hope for his cycle. The question is what to do next cycle. My RE wants me to do clomid, trigger, and progesterone but add in estrace. I have concerns about the estrace because I've read about it causing the follicles to stop growing. Has anyone ever used estrace to help thicken their lining? How did it work and what impact did it have on your follicles/rest of the cycle? We're assuming that the clomid is to blame for the thin lining as I've always had normal lining in the past, but with this being our first monitored medicated cycle it's hard to say. All other ultrasounds have been at random points throughout my cycle and none have been recent, so I'm really wondering if the thin lining has been an unnoticed issue for us on medicated cycles up until now. Also, while we are unexplained, I do have hypothyroidism (hashi's), and my cycles the past couple years randomly became very long, sometimes lasting four or five months before I get an lh surge followed by a normal 14 day luteul phase and normal length and flow period. There was talk about switching to follistim.

I post a lot over in <a href=""/r/stilltrying"">r/stilltrying</a> but I have posted on here before as well, especially after my first hsg showed both tubes blocked at the proximal end. After I went in for a tubal cannulation and they discovered both tubes we&#39;re infact open, and going back through the original images showed that the doctor had made a mistake (there wasn&#39;t a proper cover on my cervix possibly due to natothian cysts), I went back to <a href=""/r/stilltrying"">r/stilltrying</a>. But as we&#39;re about to hit our 2yr ttc 1yr post start of testing intervention, and as our treatment cycles become more in-depth and complicated I find myself lurking on this sub more and more. I&#39;m 26f, unexplained infertility. We&#39;ve done three rounds of clomid, two rounds of femara (I do not respond to femara we&#39;ve discovered, even on the higher doses), and waiting for my period after my first cycle being back on clomid. This was my first cycle with what they considered aggressive monitoring, plus my first cycle with a trigger shot and precautionary progesterone suppositories (prometrium). I had only one dominate follicle this cycle, that went from 15mm CD 12, to 17mm CD 14, to 24mm CD 16. The last ultrasound was done at an ER, and there&#39;s question about whether the measurement was accurate but that&#39;s another story. I triggered the night of CD16, with only 5mm lining. On CD 12 my lining was measuring at 7.6mm, but the two ultasounds after both showed 5mm lining, the last showing tri pattern. </p>

<p>Obviously with 5mm lining there never was any hope for his cycle. The question is what to do next cycle. My RE wants me to do clomid, trigger, and progesterone but add in estrace. I have concerns about the estrace because I&#39;ve read about it causing the follicles to stop growing. Has anyone ever used estrace to help thicken their lining? How did it work and what impact did it have on your follicles/rest of the cycle? We&#39;re assuming that the clomid is to blame for the thin lining as I&#39;ve always had normal lining in the past, but with this being our first monitored medicated cycle it&#39;s hard to say. All other ultrasounds have been at random points throughout my cycle and none have been recent, so I&#39;m really wondering if the thin lining has been an unnoticed issue for us on medicated cycles up until now. Also, while we are unexplained, I do have hypothyroidism (hashi&#39;s), and my cycles the past couple years randomly became very long, sometimes lasting four or five months before I get an lh surge followed by a normal 14 day luteul phase and normal length and flow period. There was talk about switching to follistim. We&#39;re all out of pocket for everything from the two HSGs I&#39;ve had, to the ultrasounds, to the meds and we are going to struggle to afford the injectables if that&#39;s the path we take. Obviously it would take care of the thin lining problems caused by the clomid, but if there&#39;s a chance that the estrace will help I think it&#39;s worth trying.
