I have been on this website for a while, but only just became a member so that I could join this community. Both me and my husband are 30 and have been diagnosed with unexplained infertility. All the testing looks normal to this point. November will mark 3 years of trying. So far I have been on Clomid 25mg for 3 unmonitored cycles, then Clomid 50mg for 3 cycles with an ultrasound and hcg injection with timed intercourse. With the Clomid I usually had one good sized egg on each side. After 6 cycles of Clomid, my RE switched me to Letrozole 5mg. Last month he didn't monitor anything, so I used some OPKs and temperature to estimate ovulation...and it all seemed normal. This month I asked for some monitoring and low and behold at CD14 I had a bunch of tiny follicles with the largest measuring 11mm. The OPK was positive and my typical ovulation symptoms happened on this day.  They asked me to come back CD17 to see if it had grown...  and there was nothing there. So maybe I ovulated that itty bitty egg. 

My question: Has anyone who ovulates on their own, and ovulated well with Clomid...just not responded to Letrozole? From what I read online, people usually have better responses to Letrozole, so I just don't know what to make of this.  

As a side note, I went and got a second opinion from another RE last week and he said we've given Timed Intercourse plenty of opportunity to work and it was time to move onto IUI.

He will never see our baby. Our first appointment was next Monday. He was supposed to see our baby then. I came home and the neighbor had hung Halloween decorations in their yard.

I work with my mom and she had announced to every regular customer that I was expecting, well after I asked her to stop and told her I was worried about exactly this. She wanted me to call my aunt and tell her, too. I said it was too soon and I didn't have it in me to have to untell everyone if the worst happened. She dialled the phone and pressed it into my hand anyways.

I keep thinking about ""arguing"" the gender with my in-laws. The playful banter when you think you will get to know a gender. My mother-in-law said, ""well, it is what it is already."" And, in my head, over and over, I just think, ""yeah. It's a dead baby.""

The only things I have left of this baby are the clothes it will never wear, the coupons that outlasted them, the positive pregnancy tests I couldn't bear to throw away, and the tissue I will soon lose, too.

<p>I work with my mom and she had announced to every regular customer that I was expecting, well after I asked her to stop and told her I was worried about exactly this. She wanted me to call my aunt and tell her, too. I said it was too soon and I didn&#39;t have it in me to have to untell everyone if the worst happened. She dialled the phone and pressed it into my hand anyways.</p>

<p>I keep thinking about &quot;arguing&quot; the gender with my in-laws. The playful banter when you think you will get to know a gender. My mother-in-law said, &quot;well, it is what it is already.&quot; And, in my head, over and over, I just think, &quot;yeah. It&#39;s a dead baby.&quot;</p>

<p>The only things I have left of this baby are the clothes it will never wear, the coupons that outlasted them, the positive pregnancy tests I couldn&#39;t bear to throw away, and the tissue I will soon lose, too. I slept with a positive pregnancy test in my hand, because it was the closest I ever got to them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to kill myself but if I could take a small break from being awake, it&#39;d be nice.</p>

I figured that between that measly chance and my extreme needle phobia (I have to take a performance anxiety drug for every shot and blood draw to stave off panic attacks) that we should stop dicking around and just commit to more needles with a much higher chance of success, rather than keep trying needles with such a low chance. 

But! It turns out that our ""great"" coverage doesn't cover even a penny of IVF, and our clinic (through Kaiser) doesn't do IVF anyway. This was pretty devastating news. My husband is looking into whether or not he has any insurance options through work that would provide us with any coverage, and we might be able to get some funding support through family, but even if those work out new insurance wouldn't kick in until January, and we'd still have to find a clinic and get into their system before anything could happen. That's at best months of delays.

So now I'm wondering if it would be worth doing the rest of the IUIs that we're covered for, just to be doing something in the meantime.

25,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Went for an HSG this week to complete my fertility workup with the hopes of starting IVF with PGD. I have a rare genetic condition which warrants the PGD. Unrelated to this, they found another rare condition on imaging:  unicornuate uterus. Essentially only half of my uterus is developed properly. Despite the radiologist's reassurance that women *can* become pregnant with this condition, extensive research and discussion with my RE confirms that women have difficulty *staying* pregnant. This is a devastating diagnosis to receive. The live birth rate is low, the chances of severe complications, including very preterm birth, miscarriage, fetal demise are very high. The RE is strongly recommending surrogacy as our best option to become parents. Other factors are in our favor, we are able to make embryos with my eggs and my husband's sperm. We don't have the cash on hand but I am a physician and my income potential is high, and we know that to even be able to consider surrogacy is a point of privilege.

I am devastated and grieving the loss of the possibility to carry my own child, and my husband is grieving with me. It has only been 3 days since the HSG, and less than 24 hours since meeting with the RE, and I know we are still in a state of shock about this new diagnosis. We have not shared our fertility concerns with almost anyone in our lives until this week. We are experiencing such an outpouring of love after reaching out to friends and family, and we are grateful for that. I have been missing work, but my boss is extremely supportive, and I have been at least doing the commute and staying for a couple hours at a time.

Although we have been trying for a baby for a long time, my husband and I are both shocked that there is an anatomic explanation for our infertility. It feels so final. It hurts more than I could have imagined. Before searching for answers, we tried to prepare for all of the possibilities, and were already on the same page about considering surrogacy if needed from some ""worst case scenario"" conversations. 

My intellectual/doctor brain is trying to stay calm and recognize that this is not a worst case scenario. We have a plan, and the most likely outcome from that plan is a healthy baby of our own. Over the next 6 months we will both go through the process of creating embryos and having them genetically tested. We will then take a lot of time to pursue the surrogacy path. I am also meeting with a high risk OB to better understand my diagnosis, if anything just to help make peace about this door closing. As the RE pointed out, the goal is a healthy baby, and surrogacy is our best option to accomplish that.

This hurts so much. I have gotten to some pretty dark places in the last couple of days. I have met with my therapist repeatedly this week, and I have spent hours on the phone with friends and family. My husband is the most supportive possible person. I know I am not alone, but it still feels like a very lonely place. This is grief.

I have a rare genetic condition which warrants the PGD. Unrelated to this, they found another rare condition on imaging:  unicornuate uterus. Essentially only half of my uterus is developed properly. Despite the radiologist&#39;s reassurance that women <em>can</em> become pregnant with this condition, extensive research and discussion with my RE confirms that women have difficulty <em>staying</em> pregnant. This is a devastating diagnosis to receive. The live birth rate is low, the chances of severe complications, including very preterm birth, miscarriage, fetal demise are very high. The RE is strongly recommending surrogacy as our best option to become parents. Other factors are in our favor, we are able to make embryos with my eggs and my husband&#39;s sperm. We don&#39;t have the cash on hand but I am a physician and my income potential is high, and we know that to even be able to consider surrogacy is a point of privilege.</p>

<p>I am devastated and grieving the loss of the possibility to carry my own child, and my husband is grieving with me. It has only been 3 days since the HSG, and less than 24 hours since meeting with the RE, and I know we are still in a state of shock about this new diagnosis. We have not shared our fertility concerns with almost anyone in our lives until this week. We are experiencing such an outpouring of love after reaching out to friends and family, and we are grateful for that. I have been missing work, but my boss is extremely supportive, and I have been at least doing the commute and staying for a couple hours at a time.</p>

34,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"First I want to thank everyone on this board! I'm a lurker so this is my first post here. :) 

My husband & I have been trying for 15 cycles & just had our first appt with an RE. I was guilty of not really researching - a friend had seen their practice in another state so I just found the same place near my house & took a chance. They have a mix of terrible & wonderful reviews online, which I'm sure goes for most places haha, so I took that with a grain of salt. A friend recently told me avoid this place at all costs & come to find my acupuncturist & therapist have heard some not so stellar things, but I kept the appointment because I waited a month & figured it couldn't hurt. 

Anyway, I'm an over thinker so of course this was in my head & I was worrying about picking the wrong place. We had the appointment & honestly it was fine! Did blood work, ultrasounds & set up my husband for an SA in a few days so it felt good to get the ball rolling & I liked the doctor enough. He blew off my MTHFR & said it didn't matter, so that was kind of weird but whatever. I did have 1 CP at the 10 month mark.  

I'm on day 45 of my cycle now so I'm getting annoyed with my body - he suggested Provera to induce my period (after they call with progesterone results to see if I ovulated) then monitored cycle with Fermara & IUI. His guess is I'm not actually ovulating. I asked my nurse what the side effects of Provera were & she looked at me kind of annoyed & just said ""none"" and walked away. A quick search told me otherwise, so that really annoyed me!

They just called & told me my progesterone was 9 (a few days later than they said they would but oh well! It was also some random nurse I never met but thats ok) so I ovulated & I just need to wait til I get my period and call them for a day 3 ultrasound and to set up an HSG.

So my question is...how many opinions did you get?! I have 2 more set up for next week & the following at different places. One is with a Dr. that came highly recommended but she works out of a hospital which kind of bugs me & I heard you can end up seeing any doctor thats there when you go, not the one you start wth. This sounds crazy but I spent a long time in the hospital getting treated for cancer/getting chemo so I pretty much hate them. I think going there a bunch for blood work would stress me out & bring back bad memories & I don't want to feel like a sick person again.

Second is with a place my therapist & acupuncturist both recomended. (it's Shady Grove if anyone has experience!)

I&#39;m a lurker so this is my first post here. :) </p>

<p>My husband &amp; I have been trying for 15 cycles &amp; just had our first appt with an RE. I was guilty of not really researching - a friend had seen their practice in another state so I just found the same place near my house &amp; took a chance. They have a mix of terrible &amp; wonderful reviews online, which I&#39;m sure goes for most places haha, so I took that with a grain of salt. A friend recently told me avoid this place at all costs &amp; come to find my acupuncturist &amp; therapist have heard some not so stellar things, but I kept the appointment because I waited a month &amp; figured it couldn&#39;t hurt. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m an over thinker so of course this was in my head &amp; I was worrying about picking the wrong place. We had the appointment &amp; honestly it was fine! Did blood work, ultrasounds &amp; set up my husband for an SA in a few days so it felt good to get the ball rolling &amp; I liked the doctor enough. He blew off my MTHFR &amp; said it didn&#39;t matter, so that was kind of weird but whatever. I did have 1 CP at the 10 month mark.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m on day 45 of my cycle now so I&#39;m getting annoyed with my body - he suggested Provera to induce my period (after they call with progesterone results to see if I ovulated) then monitored cycle with Fermara &amp; IUI. His guess is I&#39;m not actually ovulating. I asked my nurse what the side effects of Provera were &amp; she looked at me kind of annoyed &amp; just said &quot;none&quot; and walked away. A quick search told me otherwise, so that really annoyed me!</p>

<p>They just called &amp; told me my progesterone was 9 (a few days later than they said they would but oh well! It was also some random nurse I never met but thats ok) so I ovulated &amp; I just need to wait til I get my period and call them for a day 3 ultrasound and to set up an HSG.</p>

<p>So my question is...how many opinions did you get?! I have 2 more set up for next week &amp; the following at different places. One is with a Dr. that came highly recommended but she works out of a hospital which kind of bugs me &amp; I heard you can end up seeing any doctor thats there when you go, not the one you start wth. This sounds crazy but I spent a long time in the hospital getting treated for cancer/getting chemo so I pretty much hate them. I think going there a bunch for blood work would stress me out &amp; bring back bad memories &amp; I don&#39;t want to feel like a sick person again.</p>

<p>Second is with a place my therapist &amp; acupuncturist both recomended. (it&#39;s Shady Grove if anyone has experience!) They both said you&#39;re assigned a team that is with you the whole time &amp; they know your case really well &amp; actually call you back. I&#39;m just overally stressing about switching now that things are moving alone &amp; delaying treatment because I&#39;m in my head about every stupid thing.</p>

HI everyone- wall of complicated text coming at you- this is regarding very nitty gritty cystic fibrosis carrier screening issues…hoping that in the 9,000 +people on this sub someone else will have a clue about this!

I posted an intro awhile back, but have not been very active here because nothing is really going on TTC-wise lately. A quick recap is that my husband and I were probably going to need to do IVF for endometrosis reasons, I also have somewhat DOR, and then we got the word that we are both CF carriers so were told we had to go straight to IVF. The doctor that gave my husband’s results to me over the phone told me not to bother talking to a genetic counselor because they would just tell us to do IVF. When I spoke to my RE a month later, he again told us we were both carriers and said to talk to the genetic counselor at Invitae simply to get started on getting the PGD testing set up.

When I spoke to the counselor on the phone, she told me that Invitae/Good Start lab had just changed the criteria for CF carrier testing reporting. If my husband had been tested on the same day I was, he would have been considered negative as a carrier. But in the month between our testing, they widened the criteria to include people with mutations causing CTFR related disorders. (this means things like congenital absence of the vas deferens, chronic pancreatic issues, and possibly some degree of respiratory issues). It actually says right on my husband’s report that he is a carrier for “CTFR related disorders” and not a “Cystic fibrosis” carrier (which is what mine says). His specific mutation is called 5T 11TG. I have a classic type 1 mutation that would definitely cause CF if combined with another classic mutation.

The genetic counselor said that with the new changes, everyone is very confused, and that doctors either have not even gotten education on this or haven’t absorbed the new info. What both doctors told us is definitely incorrect- our potential offspring with both copies of our bad mutations would almost certainly not have classic CF. But no one can really say how likely it is that our offspring would be to have any issues at all, or how severe those issues would be. Chronic pancreatitis or being sterile seem like pretty big issues to me, and then there is apparently new evidence that is not even published yet about higher risks of respiratory issues.

At this point, no one can answer for me if any of the PGD testing labs will even offer embryo testing to us, and if it is even necessary to do it (and thus necessary to do IVF).  I have both the genetic counselor and an NP from my clinic trying to figure that out. Plus who even knows if an insurance company would consider this serious enough to cover the testing (invitae has already said it does not met their criteria for paying for the PGD, which they do for definitely life threatening diseases).  Apparently having a 5T mutation is not particularly rare, so this is something that is going to be coming up more and more. Even with a degree in biology and being an NP…I am SO confused! Help!

1) Has anyone banked embryos from back to back rounds in order to do PGS on the lot? 

Given my age (40) and 2 MC's this past year, we've agreed to test but I'm rolling right into another round of retrievals before the testing comes back. Given the out of pocket cost of PGS, I'm considering freezing any blasts from this round, then thawing them to biopsy with any blasts from next round. I know that this will put extra stress on them but if we only get a couple make it to blast, it seems very unlikely that any will be normal. We will have a maximum of 4 blasts (day 1 today and 4 fertilized). 

2) Any suggestions on things to do differently this time? Has anyone had their protocol evolve as they age? I've been doing 300 Follistim, 150 Menopur, cetrotide and have had decent response in the past (this round being the worst).

I walked in the door, say hello, she suspiciously asked me how I was feeling, then put her hand on my stomach and asked, ""are you?"" I of course almost start to cry, tell her that her question is not ok, she apologizes, and then she says goodnight and leaves the room. Then I go to the bathroom to do a PIO shot.  This all happens within 3 minutes of me walking in the door after traveling for 5 hours.

I understand that she is 81, that she really doesn't get how IVF works, and that she had no intention of being hurtful, and I'm still really hurt. For a long time, we told her nothing about trying in large part because she says super awkward things like this and also because I can't be responsible for her emotions around this. She always ends our conversations with something like, ""I'm so glad you're happy. I'm happy when you're happy."" I can barely be responsible for my emotions, let alone having to bear hers if I revealed that this infertility journey often leaves me miserable. 

Now I can't believe I have to stay with her for 4 more days.

Then I go to the bathroom to do a PIO shot.  This all happens within 3 minutes of me walking in the door after traveling for 5 hours.</p>

<p>I understand that she is 81, that she really doesn&#39;t get how IVF works, and that she had no intention of being hurtful, and I&#39;m still really hurt. For a long time, we told her nothing about trying in large part because she says super awkward things like this and also because I can&#39;t be responsible for her emotions around this. She always ends our conversations with something like, &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re happy. I&#39;m happy when you&#39;re happy.&quot; I can barely be responsible for my emotions, let alone having to bear hers if I revealed that this infertility journey often leaves me miserable. </p>

So per my fertility clinic's recommendation my husband and I have been doing the Keto diet for a few months. 

Have any of you done the keto diet for fertility and if so when did you stop? Transfer day, taking a pregnancy test, or did you just continue? 

I tried to ask the clinic and they said it is a good lifestyle.  Really I'm willing to do anything for IVF to work, (I will have my first cycle on my next cycle), but after it works or doesn't work, I'm not doing keto for a lifestyle change. I'm only doing keto for hopes of it helping fertility. Does anyone have any tips for me? It's a silly question, because out of everything eating preference isn't a big deal, but this is all stressful so it would be nice to know when I could eat a real cookie again.

Today we are starting a new cycle of IVF, and I had to get a fuckton of blood drawn and an ultrasound. My veins are small and it's always painful. (Not that it's a walk in the park for large-veined people, I'm sure).  The ultrasound was also very uncomfortable, some technicians are careful but today's was not. (Again, even when those go well, they're still not fun). Add in the stress of the fact that my job is being a dick about insurance right now and we have to pay out of pocket even though we shouldn't have to. I have to call my boss every other day to be like ""did you send in the form yet?"" On top of that work is just crazy busy. Because of all the stress I actually had an outbreak of shingles last month, which was not fun. 

So I'm not in the best mood. And bless her heart the technician was trying to make small talk but just kept saying the wrong thing. And I was nice to her, but when I'm recounting the events to my husband he's all, ""you could be more positive."" And just... oh my god. Come on. This is NOT the time. Technically, yes, I could be more positive. I could also technically be a lot MORE negative. And the best way to get someone to be MORE negative is to tell them to ""be more positive"" right in the moment when they're obviously stressed! 

So I'm just livid. I wanted to scream a string of abusive words, but that's not OK, so I let out a frustrated ""Argh!"" And I tell him, ""you get a pint of blood drawn and a stick shoved up your body and you can be as positive about it as you want to be."" Not de-escalating the situation, I know. But he can't just say, ""I see you are stressed and maybe we should take a break,"" he has to be right and keeps at it, making it so much worse. 

I don't complain because I want pity. I just want to let it out. I usually hold stuff in and then I get shit like shingles and alopecia and other stress-related physical illnesses. After a procedure I feel like I have a right to be negative. If he doesn't want to hear it, fine, he can say that. I get that it's annoying. I wish I could be more positive, too. 

But even so, he can't tell me how to fucking feel. 

BTW I don't swear when we argue. I'm just letting it out here. 

Ugh, we should probably go to counselling because we have the same fight all the time. I know I'm not 100% perfect, and I have been working on being more patient and positive, but I'm pretty sure he started it by telling me how to feel, as though what I am going through is nothing.

She fully acknowledges the pain and let’s me be me, and I’m so glad I have her in my life.

Background: Just completed first round of IVF (12 days of lupron followed by 9 days of gonal f/menopur stims, HCG trigger). 14 eggs, 9 fertilized, only 1 looking good on day 3. Transferred 3 (all others arrested by day 6). Resulted in chemical pregnancy. I have success once, with IUI (3 years ago). That's the only other time I've gotten any kind of positive. AMH is \~.7, FSH \~8, AFC \~5-8. It seems my diagnosis is DOR but I've never gotten that officially.

I'd like to ask:

* What does it meant that this resulted in a CP when I've never had one before? (Good thing? Bad thing?) I realize it points to an abnormal embryo but it seems significant that I even got this far.
* What would we do differently if we did another round? Are there specific DOR protocols I should ask about?
* Prospects of doing another round with my eggs vs donor eggs.

My mom is the one who told me about her pregnancy, because my sister in law felt badly about telling me. My nephew's second birthday is this weekend and my mom is pressuring me to congratulate her on her pregnancy (she even tried to guilt trip me yesterday by telling me that the things she regrets most in her life have been as a result of her own 'selfishness' - that felt good).  I'm honestly not sure I can physically get the words out without bawling in front of my entire family this weekend, so I contemplated writing her a letter, or just texting her.  I AM happy for her, that she gets to have another child, and especially after a loss, but I don't feel particularly ""congratulatory"". I'm bitter. She's almost 9 years younger than me and has lapped me.  I'm really not sure what to do or say.  I haven't talked to her since she found out she was pregnant (she knows all about our IVF struggle, and she found out she was pregnant again around the same time we found out our second transfer failed, so I knew something was up when she basically stopped communicating with me).

Does a simple ""Congratulations on your pregnancy"" text suffice after a miscarriage?  I don't want to make things awkward for everyone else, but I also am at such a low point emotionally, that I am absolutely dreading even going to my nephew's party this weekend, seeing my brother and sister in law, and acknowledging that she is pregnant and having her second baby at 26, while I've yet to even get pregnant at age 34 . Doesn't help that I'm also in the middle of another FET cycle. Thank you all in advance for your advice.

It's easy to let emotion take over when you're dealing with fertility issues, and I want to do my best to remain as clearheaded as possible.

I have a friend I've known for about 15 years who now lives halfway across the country. She dealt with her own fertility issues a few years ago, so I have felt comfortable reaching out to her when I felt like I needed support or just to give her updates with what was going on with me, which she actively asked for. In the beginning, she was super supportive, checking in every few days. It was nice to feel like I had someone I could lean on, especially back then (this was several months ago) when things were still kind of new and I didn't feel really comfortable talking to just anyone about my fertility situation.

Then in March I had a miscarriage. I sent her a text to let her know, and received one back from her saying ""I'm so sorry."" And that is the last time I heard from her since. Until two days ago, when she texted me to say ""Hey friend! I'm going to be in town X weekend, will you be around?""

I was very hurt when I suddenly stopped receiving support from this friend, right at the point when I perhaps needed it the most. I have not heard from her AT ALL for seven months, and for all that time it has bothered me that she dropped out of the picture. (My hurt feelings were probably exacerbated by the fact that this friend isn't the only person who has done this -- I have another friend who has done exactly the same thing). And then she randomly shows up casually asking if I want to meet up when she passes through town.

So here's where I would really appreciate your input: I asked my husband how he thinks I should respond to her. I am inclined to want to avoid her, because I feel dismissed. His answer to me was that he thinks I need to let this go, because ""sometimes good people do shitty things.""

Is he right? Do I need to let this go?

To be clear, I fully understand that things like infertility in general and miscarriages in particular can really wig people out, and sometimes they don't say anything because they don't know what to say. It's also very possible she feels a bit wrong-footed because, although she did struggle with infertility initially, she ended up having triplets after only two cycles with clomid (!), so she hasn't gone through the extent of things that I have. But still. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I can't help but feel a bit abandoned and angry.

What do y'all think? Take the high road, as my husband suggests? Or am I justified to feel the way I do? Don't hold back - I really want your honest thoughts. And I thank you for them in advance!

This week I finished Jenny Han's *To all the boys I've loved before,* which was similar to but different from the movie. At first I thought that the differences weren't a great thing, but as I read on I realized that the elements exclusive to the book help to make it a good book, and the elements exclusive to the movie make it a good movie. They were appropriate changes for the respective mediums.

After that I started Kate Alcott's *A touch of stardust* which follows the story of a would-be screenwriter, new to Hollywood, who gets her first job on the set of *Gone With The Wind* and ends up getting close to Carole Lombard. So far it's pretty enjoyable - not quite can't-put-it-down, but each chapter flows nicely into the next, and the plot is engaging. I'm not holding much hope for the romance to work out, though.

We have been trying over 3 years. We have been in active treatment with an RE for over one year (with a few months off in between RE's).  I am now on my first cycle that has nothing to do with IVF since May, which is when I had my retrieval. 

We have our WTF appointment on Monday after my failed ET.  For reference, back in May we had 12 eggs retrieved, 7 mature, 6 fertilized, 3 embryos and only one PGS normal, which failed =( just now.  I have never been pregnant, ever, so the assumption that this would finally be our chance really set me up for a hard fall.

I now feel guilty because if I'm being honest, I want a break.  Not to mention I have another wedding we are attending this winter, a trip to Napa in November for a friend's 30th that we agreed to go on after our failure, and I'm in one more wedding in March.  My husband and I are just ... tired. We used to travel and have adventures and 1/3 of this year was devoted to something that never came to fruition.  We are discussing the possiblity of Hawaii over Thanksgiving also, which I am soo excited about. Also, it's really nice being at work and being sharp and social instead of in a hormonal haze and wanting to hide from everyone.

The caviat with all this is with my break I am going to want to enjoy myself which means alcohol and not watching carbs. But then I feel guilty because if I go straight into another stims cycle over December, what is going to be the prospect of my eggs then? Should I wait a full three months to do the clean eating before another egg retrieval?  But then that's like a total of 6 months waiting from now and I get so impatient at the thought.  

Coming from a Catholic and fertile family, I never thought I would have to worry about drinking.  Well, if we're being honest, I never thought I'd have to worry about NOT getting pregnant, either, lol.  The sheer unfairness of the pressure that IF puts us under is so hard sometimes.

It will be interesting to see what my RE says on Monday.  I feel like if anyone can make this happen for me, it's him... eventually. Hopefully. Until then, the internal struggle between Guilt and Break wages onward.

I am in Ontario for family reasons and I will proceed with a retrieval here instead of home. Husband will fly in and out for his part (the fees are much cheaper here). The RE today was saying that his clinic offers a duostim cycle. 

A standard stim cycle involves stimming through the follicular phase, doing the retrieval and then letting the ovaries rest during the luteal phase, to wait for either a period or embryo transfer. A duostim cycle involves stimming through the follicular phase, doing the retrieval, and then stimming again immediately through the luteal phase. 

He usually does it for women who want their eggs retrieved prior to cancer treatment. He said there is no difference between duo-cycles and back-to-back cycles, and that there is some good literature on it. 

Has anyone else heard of this?

I am 40 years old, turning 41 in January. My AMH is 2.2ng/mL (up from 0.7ng in March after supplementing with DHEA), antral follicle count is 24 (again, up from 12 follicles in March).

<p>This study says CoQ10 supplementation (100 mg/2x a day) improved motility of sperm, but none of the other parameters.... and the only below normal number for our sperm analysis was motility.  Statins decrease your CoQ10. (see below link).   (How do you know how much CoQ10 is enough when taking statins?)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>shows statins decrease CoQ10:</p>

In the meantime, both of our high quality frozen embryos died while being defrosted for a transfer. The doctor told me there is a one in four hundred chance of both drying. We were still charged the full amount for the transfer and the clinic refused to refund us or give us a credit, even after they made errors with the medication and we had to make three EXTRA seven hour trips, and get time off work, to pick up the meds. 

I have since been diagnosed with a large vericocele that I have been telling doctors I have for over three years now. The urologists initial response was ""You probably have a vericocele but you have some sperm so we'll use that for IVF."" Well 3.5 years and over $50K later, no success... so a different doctor is sending me to get the vericocele fixed. 

To make things worse, my wife got fired from her job last week (thanks Trudeau), so we have one more kick at the can and then we are probably just going to get a bunch of dogs or something. 

Im in Ontario so surgeries are supposed to be free unless they are elective, but I have to pay for vericocele surgery. Does anyone have experience with this in Ontario?

Background Info:

I was 28 during the IUIs and 29 through all my IVFs. Mr. Icse was 51 through all of it except IVF #3. Never been pregnant at all.

Me:  
AMH (all day 3): 06/17 - 1.54 (Vit D - 33); 12/17 - 0.61 (Vit D - 31); 3/18 -1.28  
FSH (day 3): 12/17 - 6.9  
LH (day 3): 12/17 - 5.2  
E2 (day 3): 12/17 - 27

Mr:  
Count is between 20 to 24 million with the exception of the 9/18\* cycle where it was 12 million.  
Motility is consistently around 38% with the exception of the 9/18\* cycle where it was 50%.  
Morphology is consistently at 2.5% with the exception of 8/18 SA where it was 4%.  
\*9/18 cycle we tried something different than the 2-3 day hold. We did a 24 hour hold with regular every other day ejaculation through the stim process to reduce DNA frag and improve ""freshness"".

Diagnosis:  
Me: DOR, Endometriosis

Transferred 1 day 5 blast and 1 day 6 blast. Failure to implant (tested from day 1).

\-Fresh transfer of 3 failed (implantation failure); Heparin started day before fresh transfer

  
Whew, that was a lot of information. I'm meeting with my RE on Monday to try and plan our 4th retrieval cycle which may or may not be with donor sperm (Mr. Icse is getting the final word). 

Some things I'm planning on discussing with the RE:  
\-Priming protocol because in some ways EPP was better, in other ways BCP was better.   
\-Trying another upped dosed antagonist protocol or attempting a MDLF protocol instead (previously he was worried I might respond TOO well, but I'm pretty sure that's changed)  
\-PGS testing (previously decided against since I have a low yield and age, but maybe a consideration now?)  
\-Intralipids or immunosuppressants for next transfer?

My FSH has been swinging wildly from month to month.  I had a longish cycle of no treatment, found a cyst, took BCP for a month to squash it.

I did two IUI cycles this summer: June 14th and July 18th. Both resulted in negative betas. After my failed second cycle, we decided to stop fertility treatment and wait until next year when we plan to switch insurance so we can have IVF coverage. Anyway, I got my period for just two days (August 6th and 7th). Which is very weird for me even with my PCOS. Since then, I HAVEN’T GOTTEN MY PERIOD. I’ve taken multiple pee tests (all neg) and have even called my RE’s office to see if maybe i could have implanted late. They said no.  

I’m now on CD 51 and am going crazy. I have terrible cramps and keep thinking it’s just pms. But more importantly I’m worried that the meds messed with my body so much that now my period is all out of whack. 

I set up an appointment with my regular gyno for Friday since they won’t see me any earlier. Even they said it could just be stress and not the meds or a late implantation. 

Has anyone else experienced crazy periods after IUI?

It seems that we have had another big turnover of users here in r/infertility. We are always glad to see members graduate, and to welcome new users in to the fold. However, when this happens things can often get a little bit contentious between new users and old users and we often see an influx of messages and complaints to the mods.

If you haven't already, please read our sidebar and/or the sticky post listing our rules. If you're on mobile you can find this under ""About of Community"" at the top of the page.

**Mention of pregnancy/ positive results post treatment is only permitted in the results thread.** Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C"". **Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules.** This is to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Sometimes mentions of children/pregnancy is painful. **Unsolicited mentions does include flair** - a reminder to keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility and those with prior success are allowed to participate here**.  Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions.  *Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success.* It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success.  Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed at the moderator's discretion.

**Set up flair which includes information on your age, diagnosis, treatment status, and current status.** This information is very helpful for our members when responding to questions. [Info on how to set up flair here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/74p8da/suggestions_for_new_members_flair_and_post_titles/)

**Use specific titles for your posts** to make them more easily searched by users. ""IVF?"" is not super helpful.  ""MFI and Endo, First round of IVF - Should we do ICSI?"" is helpful and easily searched. 

**Use the dailies!**  There are morning and afternoon threads posted by the automod. 

* The Chat posts are for anything and everything not related to Active treatment. Have a gripe about a co-worker? Friends won't stop asking about when you're having kids? Funny story? All go in the Chat thread. We encourage off-topic stand alone posts for getting to know each other such as sharing pet pictures, talking about hobbies, and book club posts.

* The Active treatment threads are for updates on your current cycle, questions about medications, or advice on easier/basic questions.

* Stand alone posts should be used for more complex topics such as asking for opinions on studies, introducing yourself with your medical history and asking for advice, etc. Always remember that you are posting on an INFERTILITY BOARD. Questions phrased like ""has anyone else tried clomid?!"" are not generally well received. There are just about 10,000 subscribers here with the majority having gone through several different courses of treatment.

**Be kind to one another.** There is no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.

**This is a science-minded, realistic, sometimes cynical sub.** There are many communities online for people who want a more ""positive"" or ""upbeat"" experience complete with baby du$t and those who are seeking ways to ""cure"" infertility with natural remedies, gimmicks or diet cleanses have many places to go. People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).

**Sex, embryos, and sperm.** These are the correct terms. Infertility isn't cute, and neither are the terms we use.  There has been an increase in automod triggers for banned terms/acronyms. Our sub prefers that [these acronyms/terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7t7092/faqthose_damned_cutesy_acronyms_terms/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=infertility&utm_content=t5_2saej) are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.  AF means ""As Fuck"" and the use of AF for referring to a period is not allowed.

**No solicitations will be allowed for monetary or medication donations.** To clarify, we have had posts asking for where to go to find donated meds. We have left those up as they don't strictly break the rule. Straight up asking for med donations is not allowed and those posts will be removed. *Posts by members who want to donate their leftover meds to others here are allowed.*

**If you see posts that break our rules or that you believe need to be reviewed by a mod, please use the report button.** The ""report"" feature is in the menu of small text under the post or comment.

We started trying NYE 2016 (barf). I have since had three clinical miscarriages at 11 weeks, 9 weeks, and 8 weeks. All MMC diagnosed during ultrasound. I have taken misoprostol twice and had three D&C’s with... how to put this delicately... mixed results. 

My second to last D&C resulted in a suspected uterine perforation and a highly dramatic ambulance transfer to another hospital and a second D&C (this time with hysteroscopy) during which they found no perforation, a significantly more abnormally shaped uterus than was diagnosed during my first hysteroscopy and HSG, and also took pictures of our dead embryo which they showed me while I was waking up from general anesthesia (whyyyyy). 

Our MC history has had plenty of other drama, including a misdiagnosed uterine AVM (no. It was retained products obviously you idiots). Second MC positive for T13. Waiting for results on our third. 

We’ve also had 3 CPs along the way which are very painful in the moment but have faded into the background given all our other drama. 

Our RPL testing has been perfect. No thyroid, immune, clotting, or karyotype results. My husband’s SA was great except for a positive leucoscreen which ha has since treated. My AMH sucks as it turns out (0.94) and he’s going in for DNA frag soon. 

I’m getting really scared you guys. Our prognosis is a 65ish% chance of a live birth within 5 years. No treatment will change that prognosis, including IVF, but treatment could decrease our time to pregnancy. 

I cannot do this for 5 more years. I want my life back. I can’t have the old happy-go-lucky one but maybe I could have one where I’m not constantly trying to get pregnant, pregnant (which is very emotionally and physically difficult for me) or dealing with miscarriage and its after-shocks. I have spent 5 months of the last 17 pregnant, 3 actively bleeding post-MC, and many more trying to recover emotionally and physically. I certainly don’t want to do this for 5 years with the increasingly significant chance it will all be for naught. 

I’ve decided I can try for a bit longer, and then I am willing to do up to three IVF retrievals with PGS, and I’m willing to transfer I guess basically all our normal embryos (depending on how many we get), and after that I want to be done.

We started trying in November 2016, had severe MFI diagnosed in December 2017, and started IVF in May 2018. 

Anyhoo, we’ve just found out that our second FET failed. No implantation (well, HCG was 5 so basically none). Same as the first FET (zero HCG). Those were our only two PGS normal embryos. We have another frozen of questionable quality which couldn’t be biopsied. 

Between FETs we found out that I have heterozygous factor v leiden, a high level of uterine/endometrial NKC, and the MTFHR gene mutation. So this transfer involved prednisolone and Clexane. Plus the “bonus” of the biopsy (scratch) before transfer to increase implantation chances. But still no dice. 

I’m so sad. I didn’t think it was going to affect me this much. I should have known better, after nearly two years of trying. We had already agreed that if this FET failed we would take a break so that I could look for work and we could save up for another retrieval. Now that is a reality and I’m finding it so horribly depressing. But I do want to give my body and my heart a bit of a break for a while. 

I wanted to reconnect with people on here because I’m feeling so so alone right now. My friends don’t understand (I was recently told to “fuck off” because I turned down a dinner invite from a friend with gastroenteritis because I was on immunosuppressants). I feel like everyone I even started this shit with is now pregnant and while I am happy for them, it makes me feel even more alone and sad and like this is never going to happen. 

I feel like we threw everything at this FET. When we try again we will be changing clinics, we’re not happy with the patient care at this one. We need to save up again first anyway. 

I know i haven’t done a lot of treatment compared to a lot of you, and that my reaction might seem premature, and all I can say is you are all warriors who have always inspired me. 

I think I’ll be around quite a bit over the next few months, and hopefully I’ve learned some stuff that might be helpful to some members. 

So, hi (again!) and special hello to those still here who I know from before. I wish we weren’t here but can’t wait to reconnect.

The new endo said ""of course you have it!"" when reading the biopsy, my history of autoimmune disease, and my family history of Graves and Hashi's. Both the new endo and my RE don't think I need to be on any extra medication, but I was talking to a friend with Hashi's over the weekend, and she thought my free T4 sounded too low.

 Before I knew I was sick my hubby and I would discuss having 2 or 3 kids. I've always wanted to be a parent. I've been taking care of other people's children forever. I was a buit in babysitter for siblings, a tween babysitter, a nanny, and now a teacher.  

When the doctors gave me my diagnosis, they gave me the option to freeze my eggs. I rejected this option because it would have delayed my surgery and treatment. What's the point of eggs if I'm dead? My husband and family supported this decision. In fact, my younger sisters offered their eggs and they were willing surrogates. My husband said he was fine with this. We also discussed adopting and he was ok. 

Two years later...sisters backed out. Husband only wants his own. He just told me in the last month he doesn't want to adopt, he feels he can't love an adopted baby. This breaks my heart. I feel punished for being infertile. He also has a lack of interest in sex since cancer... I feel like I'm  it a true woman and he doesn't love or desire me or the life we have together.

He doesn't see it this way. Maybe I do because I've loved many children who weren't mine over the course of my life?

Firstly, I want to thank this sub so much for the input and opening up your personal experiences with me. It opened my eyes to fertility struggles, and the importance of awareness of your own fertility even if its not something that may be in the realm of thinking at a particular time.

I also want to stress how important it is to get a second opinion before egg freezing. After my post I started doing some research and came across a clinic that specializes solely in egg freezing (Extend Fertility in Manhattan) and with that, was able to reduce the cost substantially. 

If anyone is interested in the consultation process I’m happy to inform. They were so professional from the beginning and made me feel calm in that everything was taken step by step and I did not feel rushed into this with the same sense of urgency as the first clinic. 

I got blood work done since I’ve been off birth control since January and my AMH is now a 1.79 and they counted 16 follicles (conservatively). Although my amh is low for my age, it is still in the normal range. The doctor asked why I was so surprised and when I said I heard that there was a possibility that birth control could suppress AMH, he told me that there is more and more literature to support this. That even if a patient came in and was on birth control they would make her go off for at least 2 months before starting this process. 

I’m not upset with how the sequence of events happened because now I know that I need to monitor yearly, and it gives me more time to save money if it is something I will need to do in the next few years. I also hope that this is something that will be less and less taboo for patients who are seen for regular checkups in their late 20’s for something to be prepared for instead of gynecologists saying it’s not necessary.

\*\*FOREWARNING: This is a wall of text\*\* tl;dr at bottom

I posted this [tidbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/8y6kx2/where_to_start/) some weeks ago about coming out of the shadows and thought it would be good for me to post an update.

But real quick - Has anyone had success with IUI having diminished ovarian reserve? I plan on snooping around /r/InfertilityBabies here momentarily.

&#x200B;

**August 6th**

Hubs has his consult with the MF specialist (great guy, really). After looking over all the labs, etc., gave us a written list of options to think over. A few were

1. Biopsy to find if any sperm or no sperm
2. mTESE
3. Donor sperm
4. Adopt
5. Get another dog

The conversation afterward was *interesting*. A lot of it being about the costs, the surgery, and I mentioned possibly pursuing IUI.  Between now and our 28th appointment we decided to look into Fost/Adopt, priviate adoption, and donor sperm.

&#x200B;

**August 28th**

Alas! Our first initial consultation with our IVF specialist was *finally* here. Meeting was as expected; general overview of how the procedure is done, a timed schedule that is ruled by the universal gods (and so help you if you f\*\*k it up), more ultrasounds, more labs, and finding out the costs associated - which I must say I am *thankful* for having some coverage at all. I have to admit that throughout this whole thing I have felt somewhat rushed, especially in dealing with our IVF specialist. Mind you a few years ago when we worked strictly with our RE, he suggested I could pursue oral or injections wiht my DOR. I asked my IVF specalist if IUI was a possibility if we went with just DOR, and that was slammed shut immediately. I kept my mouth shut because I wasn't sure what we (hubs and I) had decided what to do, yet.

&#x200B;

**Where we're at Today**

This weekend I had some downtime and decided to do what we've all done - go on a hunt to find any inkling of success out there. In my case, finding DOR women who had successful pregnancies/births using IUI. I kept telling myself, if we're going to do this, then we're exhausting all available options.

Because...

1. IVF is shit-balls expensive!
2. My insurance covers IUI procedures
3. I have the means today to take \~$1000 for a vial or two of Donor sperm.

So last night I got myself registered with a sperm bank, did my forms, etc, but learned it was mandatory for my doctor to sign a consent for release of these puppies. Fine, no biggie. I ended up writing her a love-letter of ""Listen up! This is MY choice."" since she closed the door in my face last time, I needed her to understand where I was coming from. It also made sense to me as my numbers haven't changed much and therefore, wanted the option to try this method first. If I tried Clomid once before with a sterile husband, it just may work with a donor who has proven results!

257,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Quick background on me:

After a straight-to-IVF diagnosis of severe MFI, I did two fresh transfers at my first clinic. The second one worked until an mmc at 12 weeks. Each cycle had retrieval numbers in the teens. I was on dexamethasone from early on in stims  for both, and continued through to week 7 or 8 or so for my mmc. And PIO/oral estrogen.

RPL after that found factor V Leiden thrombophilia. Also I have controlled autoimmune hypothyroid that as controlled for years prior. 

&#x200B;

My next clinic (moved for PGS) was a shitshow of negligence from a half-assed doctor. Did multiple banking cycles with new protocols that ended up in very low retrevial numbers. RE insisted on day 3 PGS testing for a day 5 transfer, which makes me question the validity of the PGS results. Did an FET for the single normal embryo we got. No steroids were used that I remember (maybe only a couple days around transfer).  Added lovenox as well as the usual progesterone/estrogen. Had major cramping during transfer and it failed. We changed clinics again.

&#x200B;

Current clinic does the standard routine of: freeze blasts -> PGS -> FET.  We've done 3 stims, and our number of embryos frozen and euploid has massively increased, probably due to better doctor/protocol/lab quality. However we've failed 2 FETs here. In between the FETs, a hysteroscopy discovered some D&C scar tissue that wasn't seen before, so that could have been a factor for the first/previous failure(s). But the last failure was for a ""perfect"" FET so now it's looking like we are facing repeat implantation failure. Note, my current clinic only does 4 days or so of steroids leading up to transfer day.

I have a gut feeling that there is something autoimmune in play that isn't being addressed. None of the 3 transfers since my mmc have involved any kind of extended steroid use in case of autoimmune factors like my successful transfer did. And I have a known autoimmune disease, albeit controlled. 

We are now considering going back to a fresh transfer next time, since it has worked in the past. And we'll freeze/test anything left over. We have also averaged 70% normal embryos across the last 3 cycles, and all of our abnormals had the kinds of issues that would not lead to implantation. So it seems like a reasonable chance to take if it worked before.

My RE said we can use extended steroids next time. I'm not clear on exactly which one is best and am interested to hear what others are prescribed. She said it could be dexamethosne, which I used before,  or prednisone, which is what my clinic prescribes for the 4 days prior to transfer. 

And we will also be using lovenox, and the usual PIO/estrogen/baby aspirin/supplements. She has mentioned that the Factor V leiden could be a problem for implantation but I'm not clear on what we would do for that besides the lovenox. And for my mmc cycle, we didn't yet know about this so I was not on any treatment for it and still had implantation.

She also mentioned a few other options:

\-Neupogen injections - I think it's two injections with one done the week before transfer and one some time after. (not entirely sure about timing)

\-Enbrel - She seemed to mention this as an alternative to Neupogen. This seems like a pretty heavy duty medication, though I haven't had much time to really look into it. 

She said they do not do intralipids at my clinic.

As a note, I have not had any NK cell testing or anything like that. But I have shown high thyroid antibodies in the past that lowered after going on meds. Both parents have mild autoimmune diseases - my mom has renauds, and my dad has hashimotos also, though it wasn't discovered till recently in his 60s. So I really think there could be an autoimmune issue in play here.

I'm inclined to go with the extend steroids plus neupogen and lovenox.

So I’ve sent this question yesterday to my clinic, but I thought I’d see if anyone hear had any thoughts.

My husband and I are moving forward with the donor egg program and to be accepted into shared risk, I need to have a mock ET (fluid sonogram) and then the following cycle a mock EEP.

With all the testing I’ve done I’ve finally met my insurance deductible and would have 80/20 coverage for a medicated IUI. As I understand it, I’m only having to do the mock cycles because I’ve never had a medicated assisted cycle with a clinic.

I know it’s a BIG long shot, but if a medicated IUI would accomplish and gather the same information as the mock cycles, what would be the harm in doing a medicated IUI and at least spend the month with tiny tiny little more of a miracle shot.

My insurance caps out at 10,000 life time and figured why not use some of it if it does what we are trying to accomplish.

I got my birth control implant (nexplanon) removed in August of 2017 and have not used any birth control since. In 2009 I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) via blood test saying I had high testosterone, but recently I had a new blood test and it said my testosterone levels were normal and I don’t have any other symptoms of PCOS. I’m also a type 1 diabetic and have it it since I was 4 years old. Recently,  I got the insulin pump and my diabetes is in control and is actually in the best control it’s been since I was like 8 years old!! That being said, I am about 80-100lbs overweight.

Also, I don’t know if we should go just to have my bf get checked out too since maybe it’s not just me? 

Edit: I forgot to mention when I got my last blood work back my testosterone levels were 40 ng/dl, which according to the endocrinologist was on the higher level of the normal range, however when I look online at normal testosterone levels in women they say it’s 15-70ng/dl.

270,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"I got migraines with aura as a teen, and had my first one in years when on combined BCPs prior to a hysteroscopy last year, so have been using progesterone-only BCPs for IVF suppression. I've never had a migraine during an IVF cycle, though, stimming or FET.

It's CD1 and I'm starting FET prep today (BCPs, then Lupron Depot shot, then estrogen patches and progesterone suppositories), and am wondering if using progesterone-only BCPs could be negatively impacting me in any way.

I need to take some pill today, and I have progesterone-only pills on hand, but am wondering if I should go to the pharmacy and get some combined pills instead. My RE has been fine with me taking progesterone-only, but has just sort of said "" I suppose it's fine, I've never heard of anyone doing that."" Confidence inspiring, I know. He does have me on baby aspirin through all my cycles as a precaution.

I'm wondering if the migraine with aura was a fluke last time I was on combined BCPs. I mean, don't I have a shit ton more estrogen in my system during a stim or FET cycle?

I really want to give us the best shot of success this time, and it's just super fuzzy to me whether the BCP I choose to suppress with will have an impact.

Any ideas? I can't seem to find anything super reliable looking with an answer online -- just blog type stuff.

Thanks!

ETA: One of my concerns is that it takes me about a week, sometimes more, to get a period after coming off progesterone only pills. And I have a lot of break through bleeding I never had on combined pills, also. And my impression is that people get periods 2-3 days after taking the last active combined pill. 

I'm supposed to take Lupron Depot on day 17 of a 21-day pack of pills, then start estrogen patches once I get my period. So it seems like ""how long it takes me to get my period,"" and how that differs (potentially) depending on the type of pill could have an impact.

283,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"So last week I posted about being frustrated about even more delays to starting IVF.  Friday the 14th at my follow up hysteroscopy (I had surgery in Aug to remove uterine scarring due to Ashermans) my RE tells me he sees something that looks like a tiny bit of scar tissue or a polyp. Said if he had scissors on his office hysteroscopy scope he could have snipped it then and there that is how tiny it is.  Said I will need surgery but he is booked until November. Suggests I talk to my OB/GYN to see if she can do the surgery. Mentions next month I need to come back and see him when I'm ovulating so he can ultrasound to check my lining as well. Tells me to let him know if my OB won't do the surgery and he will see what he can do.  So that is how I leave that appt.

&#x200B;

I manage to get an appt with my OB Monday the 17th where I basically spent a $40 copay for her to tell me no. She doesn't feel comfortable doing the surgery and while she has done that surgery before....any of her patients seeing fertility specialists ALWAYS have their REs do that surgery. And while I was upset that I can't have her just do it quickly....I totally get what she is saying and agree.

So I email the clinic RN the next day telling her what my OB says and that I need to go ahead and schedule surgery.  Mentioned my RE also wanted me to come back next month to get my lining check. My response is: ""Call CD1 so we can schedule your ultrasound and he will discuss the surgery then"" WTF???! So I'm to wait a month before I can even discuss the surgery?  I email back that I was under the impression he was booked out so we need to schedule the surgery now.  And that CD1 for me was a good 3 weeks away...so it would be a month before I even get to discuss surgery.  Asked her very nicely to have the Dr call me(at his convenience of course) to very briefly discuss this. That it would put my mind at ease to at least know the plan instead of waiting a month to find out.

&#x200B;

That was tuesday afternoon I sent that email. Got a reply from her Wed am she will forward emails to the Dr. Still haven't heard anything else from clinic. No phone call. No email. Nothing.

&#x200B;

Am I justified in being really upset at the clinic right now?  Also...I turn 41 in 6 months so I feel the pressure on me even more. Hell my OB said because of my age my RE should make me a priority and fit me in. She said if the surgery is so minor he can easily fit me in one one of his surgery days.   My husband is pissed and wants us to see another Dr.  I told him that won't solve the problem and will mean even more waiting. Also...we have been seeing this Dr for quite a long time. We actually like him and the clinic and trust him. He is the best recommended RE in my area and we have never had issues before.

My plan is to wait until Monday  am (give my Dr the weekend cause he does see patients on the weekend) and if no contact...email the nurse again.  She wasn't in the room for the hysteroscopy so she didn't hear the conversation so I will review all he said so she fully understands my situation and what the RE instructed me to do.  Also remind them of my age (I don't look 40, my RE and all the clinic staff say that every appointment...which is great in general...but not great when you want your RE to grasp the urgency of the matter). Give her a list of questions that I really need answered for ease of mind either by email or phone call from someone ASAP.  Would you do this?  I'm a nurse as well and I understand how busy the clinic is...so I don't want to come off as some hysterical patient that asks a million questions...but I do want answers cause I can't go a month with no clue as to when my surgery is scheduled, what is going on, etc.

So I started the ICSI treatment that we needed cause of my husbands low sperm count thinking things would go well. Which was very naive I found out later. 

&#x200B;

the injections went well, eggs were growing fine, the pick up was doable, considering docs here do it with only naproxen, They retrieved 17 ripe eggs, and I was hoping there would be 5 embryos to freeze atleast, I had read a lot on the internet and I felt that wishing for 5 was ‘ not too much’.

4 days after the pick up we went for the transfer and there were 13 decent/bad embryos and 1 ‘ ok’ embryo, so they placed that one back.

I’ve been so worried since, thinking maybe my eggs are bad. The doctors here are not pro-active aswell, they feel we should try 3 times before changing something in the routine, while they also believe that I should have no hope after 3 tries.

my doc doesn’t really want to comment on why the embryos were bad, but I took a quick peek at the lab list and I saw that most of them weren’t ‘ even ‘ and they all had fragmentation.

&#x200B;

I'm considering IVF with PGD due to a family history of Huntington's Disease. I have a 50/50 chance of having Huntington's but I'm choosing to not to test myself for a variety of reasons (no cure, not symptomatic, etc). However, I'm in my late 20's and ready to start a family and don't want my future kids to deal with this disease. 

&#x200B;

I initially thought I would find out if I had Huntington's Disease before choosing to IVF but at this point I've saved enough money to cover everything. I met with a fertility clinic to discuss my situation and the possibility of doing IVF with PGD without finding out my own diagnosis. The doctor made it seem like taking the medications would suck for a little and the lab takes a while for PGD but this is an otherwise straightforward process and they have a 75% success rate. She said I'd probably only need to go through IVF once and we would just store additional embryos if I want additional kids in the future.

&#x200B;

I'm ready to start the IVF process and thinking it's a good option since I don't want to find out if I have Huntington's and I don't want to pass it on. Am I being naive? Part of me is worried I'm about to spend a shit ton of money on something that will be emotionally draining, possibly unnecessary (meaning if I'm not even positive for the gene), and could result in no baby. But part of me also know I don't want to find out my own diagnosis and would be willing to do whatever it takes to have a healthy kid.

So me and my husband kind of made our peace with the fact that it will not happen, after we tried to get pregnant for 3 years and after numerous tests and all sorts of medication and what not, we decided to stop everything. I know 3 years it's not a long period of time and that people have tried for longer but it was getting too heart breaking me. Every month seeing that all your efforts have gone in to vain. I just couldn't cope with it anymore. I was becoming stressed and depressed. 

Borh families are very reserved. So we never had told them as it was happening what we were doing and going through. We kind of discussed the situation at the end when we decided to stop to both our parents and siblings to let them know as we hadn't discussed or mentioned anything to them. It wasn't an in depth discussion as its still a bit of a sore topic and they seemed to be fine with it. 

Until two things happened recently. First - A few weeks ago my husband went to visit his parents on his own and they unleashed on him. Asking how many times we have sex, why we don't have kids etc. My husband try as he may to explain they wouldn't have it. We know that they are quite stressed at the moment due cancer issues with the grandmother so we just chalked it up to them venting their stress on him. I was really pissed off at them as of course they don't have the courage to bring up the matter when I'm there since I'm very vocal about my feelings and thoughts, but my husband is very shy and reserved. He came back home stressed as hell and I wanted to give them an earful for behaving that way.

Second- Today we found out that his sister is pregnant whilst we were out in a restaurant celebrating his mother's birthday day. I am happy for her but I just wanted to crawl up and cry. With no forewarning or anything she give us the news. I spent the entire meal holding back tears and not interacting much as I was constantly on the verge of starting to sob. Of course from when we left to now as I'm writing this out I haven't stopped tearing. 

I thought I had made my peace with it but it's very clear that I haven't. And I'm not sure what to do at this point as I know of course I will keep on having these feelings throughout her pregnancy.

Hi all,

When I saw my fertility psychologist last week, the upcoming holidays were the main thing I wanted to talk about. She gave me some great advice I thought I'd pass along. For our particular situation I was worried about visiting my husband's family for Thanksgiving. BIL just had a baby (after trying for a month) and I just don't know how I will be able to handle being around it and them, etc without bawling my eyes out the whole time. Last Xmas they told us in person during the family event they were expecting and I seriously still have PTSD from the experience. 

First thing, she said not stay in their house. (!!!) This had not even occurred to me, we can get a HOTEL. It will give me somewhere to escape to. BRILLIANT. Next is to get an idea of the schedule for the day, and to plan every bit out. Where I will sit, what I will do. I can sit quietly and read a book. This was such a relief to hear, I am ""allowed"" to just be in the presence of everyone but not have to talk to them. I can plan out taking a walk to get a break from everyone as well. Finally, she said to have an agreed upon time that we are leaving as a couple. This will give me an end point to focus on and avoid any fights with husband.

For Xmas, I don't really feel like seeing my own family (my own brother has a new baby as well) but would rather take a trip. Psychologist said this is perfectly fine and it's up to me to handle my own family, husband should support my decision. Again, what a relief.

We recently had our consult with a fertility clinic, its less well known and a little bit farther of a drive than the major/huge clinic here but its also much cheaper and they have comparable stats on SART. We decided to go with them because of this, I mean why would I pay literally 4 times as much to go to a more ""well known"" clinic with the same stats? Thats like paying for a brand name... She has been sending me email after email from the major clinics website about how to afford treatment or specials they have going on or ""hurry up our last cycle of the year is starting soon""... its frustrating because we have made our choice AND she's the one that keeps bringing up the fact that we are wasting money by doing something we don't need! We don't NEED to go to the big clinic either! 

&#x200B;

Normally I would just tell my husband to handle it because its his family but she's only sending the emails to me so if my husband brought it up she would just play the victim and say she was just offering suggestions of ways to pay for it at the new clinic (which I could believe except all the emails she sent to me came from the big clinic and were specific to their in house financing) and that its between me and her... I'm kinda over it at this point, I don't really care what she thinks about me but she would tell everyone else her little sob story and I like them.

I (24F) and my (27M) husband have been trying to conceive for 19 cycles. I have mild endometriosis confirmed via laparoscopy in 2015. The laparoscopy found a few spots on my uterus, which ended up being quite surprising because my pain got quite debilitating. The endo was ablated, however I now understand excision via a endo specialist is the recommend route. 6 cycles in my doctor referred my husband for a sperm analysis and myself for an HSG. This was due to the fact that after my surgery my husband and I had did not use any contraception or pull out method for a year, then I subsequently went back on bill control pills to prevent my periods from becoming painful again. His results came back normal, with a slightly low morphology (3%). My HSG while very painful came back clear.

We tried two cycles of low dose clomid without success. The only blood test that was run was my thyroid which came back normal. We ended up with a cross country move so we did not go further with any testing in home state. In current state we have begun the process of labs for me. My husbands redid his testing and all results came back great. My progesterone came back normal and I have to wait until the next cycle to run day 3 labs. My AMH came back at .39 ng/ml. I am pretty heartbroken as from what I have googled that is extremely low for my age. We were considering IUI, but with endo and my AMH is IVF our only option? I was considering having another laparoscopy due to pain, but I understand that can lead to an even lowered AMH. Previously my husband and I had discussed IVF being at least two years off if it came to that, but do we even have the time now? I suppose I am looking for endo/low AMH experiences or any advice on additional testing or questions I should use to advocate for myself. 

Thanks in advance for anyone who took the time to read this!

Hopefully this will help at least someone! Forewarning, I’m not medically trained person. I’m just a farm girl and horse owner that’s been doing IM and IV shots for them for 10 years and now doing all my own shots (up to #146 this morning) through all my treatments. If the medical people of this board would like to add on or correct me, please do!

Let's get important stuff out of the way:**ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE MESSING WITH YOUR MEDICATIONS AND USE A CLEAN SURFACE. STERILITY IS IMPORTANT! IF YOU DROP A NEEDLE, IMMEDIATELY DISPOSE OF IT!**

First, the basics where we’ll start with the explanation of needle sizing. The higher the gauge number, the smaller the needle! When you get your blood draws, that is typically a 21 gauge needle to give you reference. The little pen needles that come with your Gonal F/Follistim pens? 29 gauge. Insulin needles are generally 28 gauge. So when you look at all the different needles they give you, the higher gauge ones are generally the ones you’re going to inject with and the higher the gauge, the less you’ll feel the poke. I’ll get into specific needles for specific medications a bit later.

Now, let’s go into needle sizes and their purposes. Most of the time you’ll have ½” needles, sometimes some 1” needles, and 1 ½” needles. The ½” needles are meant for subcutaneous (subq) injections, those are the ones you generally do in your belly where you just want to pierce the skin and inject the medication into the tissue layer between skin and muscle. The 1” and 1 ½” needles can be for drawing medication or an intramuscular (IM) injection. For an IM, you want to inject the medication into the muscle and not just into the skin or fat, that is why you generally do it on the outer butt/hip or the thighs. (See this link for a diagram for gluteal IM shots, notice it’s at the TOP of the quadrant, above the butt crack: [http://d1yboe6750e2cu.cloudfront.net/i/5460901863d5cdf2bbea4888201fddcb4914a53c](http://d1yboe6750e2cu.cloudfront.net/i/5460901863d5cdf2bbea4888201fddcb4914a53c) )

Draw needles are important even though they can seem like a hassle. A draw needle is the needle you use to draw the medication from the vial and generally is a 22g x 1” or 1 ½”. By using a draw needle, you will keep your injection needle pristinely sharp which will make insertion a whole lot easier! A dull needle is harder to stick in your body and will cause far more pain than a sharp one. It only takes piercing the rubber of a vial ONCE to dull a needle.

Drawing medications from vials is tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll realize it’s actually pretty easy. Make sure to use the draw needle if there is one supposed to be used, some won’t like lo dose hCG or Lupron where you use insulin syringes with non-removable needles. The draw needle will be the longer and bigger needle (but with the lower gauge number, ie 22g x 1 ½”). Twist it onto the syringe (fun fact: this is called a leur lock style syringe) and draw enough air for the dose you need to withdraw. Insert the draw needle into the vial at a 90’ angle. Inject the air into the vial and then flip the vial upside down, pulling your syringe out to where the tip is just barely in the vial. Pull the plunger out slowly and steadily until it’s filled. You’ll see that there’s usually an air bubble at the top from where there was air space in your needle when you started to draw back. It’s an easy fix to do when you’re still drawing, just inject the liquid back into the vial until the air is gone and the syringe is full of solid liquid, then start drawing the medication back out until you get to your dose.

Once you’ve got your dose, withdraw the draw needle from the vial and then pull some air into the syringe (yes I told you to do something different a second ago, but I promise there’s a method to my madness!) so that when you remove the needle, all the medication is in the syringe and none in the needle. When you draw the air in, make sure you get the air bubble properly into the main part of the syringe, it makes getting it out much easier and lets there be only ONE air bubble versus two. Replace the draw needle with your injection needle and then push the plunger slowly to get the air bubble out until there’s a drop of needle at the tip of it. If you’re scared about pushing TOO much out because resistance, don’t push from the bottom of the plunger, but grab the neck only a little bit above the top of the actual syringe and push from there. That way your fingers will meet the syringe before you can go too far.

I can’t stress how important it is to get the air out of the needle. It will make your injection so much easier and less painful when you go to do it. If there’s multiple bubbles of air in there, simply flick the syringe until they become one big air bubble at the top. Sometimes that means you have to draw even more air into the syringe and that’s ok. When you get your one big air bubble at the top, carefully push the plunger until all the air is out before attempting to inject.

Alright, now onto specific needles for specific medications:

* Gonal F/Follistim pens have their own pen needles which just get screwed right on. Don’t throw away the big umbrella cap when you get the needle on as you can put it back on for easy removal of the pen needle!
* Menopur will come with two vials and two needles, but one syringe. Use the 22g x 1 ½” needle to draw the sterile diluent (sodium chloride) from the vial and then injecting the liquid into the powder. You can use the needle to stir the powder a bit to reconstitute it a bit quicker, DO NOT SHAKE VIAL. Draw the reconstituted medication into the syringe and then replace with the injection needle which is either a 27g x ½” or 5/8” needle. Remember to follow the drawing instructions above to get the air out!
* Cetrotide will come with a prefilled syringe of sterile water. Use the 20g x 1 ½” needle first to inject the liquid into the powder vial. Use the needle to help stir the powder a bit to reconstitute it a bit quicker, DO NOT SHAKE VIAL. Draw the reconstituted medication into the syringe and then replace with the injection needle which is a 27g x ¾” needle. Remember to follow the drawing instructions above to get the air out!
* Ovidrel and Ganirelix are both pre-filled syringes with needles permanently attached. Just make sure to get the air out before injecting!
* Lupron and lo dose hCG use insulin syringes which are permanently affixed 28g x ½” needles so there is no draw needle. However, these needles are TINY and BEND EASILY! Be careful when you go to draw the medication from the vial to insert exactly at a 90’ angle and withdraw at the same angle. If you bend the needle, inject the medication right back into the vial and try again with a fresh needle.
* Progesterone in Oil/Ethyl Oleate is probably the most important medication to use a draw needle with. Typically, they send a 20/21/22g needle that’s 1 ½” long. Draw the medication from the vial with it with the instructions given previously. Now, for the injection needle. It seems like a lot of people are sent a 22g x 1 ½” needle to inject with, but I prefer a 25g x 1 ½”. The injection is certainly quicker with a 22g needle because you can force more of the PIO/PEO through it faster as it’s bigger, but a 25g more painless IMO. They will say that you can’t do PIO with a 25g, but that’s a lie as I’ve done a lot of them. When using the 25g you will have to push the plunger harder and keep an eye on it to make sure all the medication is out of it because there is more resistance than the 22g. There is also a happy medium between the two where you can get a 23g needle. For length, 1 ½” is appropriate for most people. HOWEVER, if you are petite or thin with no fat or want to do the thighs (way more painful), you can request a 1” needle as it has to penetrate much less layers to reach muscle. Your nurse will have to specify the 1” needle for your PIO as the pharmacy can’t change that, but you CAN request a different gauge of needle from the pharmacy at fill!

I will not get into actual injecting because I think that the Freedom Pharmacy injection videos are pretty good, but here are some tips:

* Freedom Pharmacy link: [http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/](http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/)
* Bevel point (this is the very tip of the needle) should be angled to enter the skin first for an easier (and less painful) time piercing the skin. For the really small needles, it doesn’t matter too much, but for anything 25g or less it can make a HUGE difference.
* Pinching the skin to give a firm injection spot can help make injections painless because there will be less resistance.
* For PIO/PEO, pushing around the injection spot to make it firm can do the same as pinching the skin, but much easier to do. I push with my hand and then do like a Vulcan hand symbol where the injection site is between my spread fingers. Also, relax the leg of the side you’re going to inject. Looser muscle is easier to penetrate than one that’s taunt. It’s important NOT TO FLINCH!
* After the injection is done and needle removed, immediately apply pressure with a piece of gauze or cotton swab. That will help slow the bleeding much faster.

Now onto syringes! This part should be far shorter at least. There are two styles of syringes you will probably deal with besides insulin syringes, luer lock and luer slip. Luer lock is where the needle twists into the tip of the syringe and luer slip is where the needle just slips on to the tip. If for some reason they ask you which you prefer, always say luer lock because they are far more secure! The insulin syringes are the ones with the tiny needles permanently affixed to where you can’t remove the needle.

What makes most of the syringes different in the ones you receive are the units and the volume capacity. There are two units you will deal with in IVF, generally, international units (iu sometimes just referred to as units) and milliliters (mL). They do convert very easily if you get told your dosage in iu instead of mL, but the syringe doesn’t have iu on it. 10 iu/units = 0.1mL. Most of your subq injections will come with either a 50iu/0.5mL syringe OR a 1mL syringe. Your PIO/PEO will probably come with a 3mL syringe. Make sure the syringe you’re using will hold the full dose of what you need to inject and try not to use a bigger syringe than necessary. If they’re packaged separately from your medication, it can be helpful to put them in a Ziploc baggy and label them with the size, needle(s) and medication they’re supposed to be used with. Also put the needles you’re supposed to use with them in the bag. By keeping them separated and labelled, it can make your medication prep so much quicker and easier!

I hope this has helped at least a few people and made some people feel more confident and knowledgeable about which needles to use and how to use them. Good luck to everyone!

P.S. If someone would like for me to make a vial drawing video, I can try to do so.

&#x200B;

ETA: If you ever feel insecure about inserting the needle and injecting, buy an orange from the grocery store and use one of your needles and syringes to practice, filling the syringe with water. The orange simulates a similar resistance as skin!

They will say that you can’t do PIO with a 25g, but that’s a lie as I’ve done a lot of them. When using the 25g you will have to push the plunger harder and keep an eye on it to make sure all the medication is out of it because there is more resistance than the 22g. There is also a happy medium between the two where you can get a 23g needle. For length, 1 ½” is appropriate for most people. HOWEVER, if you are petite or thin with no fat or want to do the thighs (way more painful), you can request a 1” needle as it has to penetrate much less layers to reach muscle. Your nurse will have to specify the 1” needle for your PIO as the pharmacy can’t change that, but you CAN request a different gauge of needle from the pharmacy at fill!</li>
</ul>

<p>I will not get into actual injecting because I think that the Freedom Pharmacy injection videos are pretty good, but here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freedom Pharmacy link: <a href=""http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/"">http://www.freedommedteach.com/eng/</a></li>
<li>Bevel point (this is the very tip of the needle) should be angled to enter the skin first for an easier (and less painful) time piercing the skin. For the really small needles, it doesn’t matter too much, but for anything 25g or less it can make a HUGE difference.</li>
<li>Pinching the skin to give a firm injection spot can help make injections painless because there will be less resistance.</li>
<li>For PIO/PEO, pushing around the injection spot to make it firm can do the same as pinching the skin, but much easier to do. I push with my hand and then do like a Vulcan hand symbol where the injection site is between my spread fingers. Also, relax the leg of the side you’re going to inject. Looser muscle is easier to penetrate than one that’s taunt. It’s important NOT TO FLINCH!</li>
<li>After the injection is done and needle removed, immediately apply pressure with a piece of gauze or cotton swab. That will help slow the bleeding much faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now onto syringes! This part should be far shorter at least. There are two styles of syringes you will probably deal with besides insulin syringes, luer lock and luer slip. Luer lock is where the needle twists into the tip of the syringe and luer slip is where the needle just slips on to the tip. If for some reason they ask you which you prefer, always say luer lock because they are far more secure! The insulin syringes are the ones with the tiny needles permanently affixed to where you can’t remove the needle.</p>

<p>What makes most of the syringes different in the ones you receive are the units and the volume capacity. There are two units you will deal with in IVF, generally, international units (iu sometimes just referred to as units) and milliliters (mL). They do convert very easily if you get told your dosage in iu instead of mL, but the syringe doesn’t have iu on it. 10 iu/units = 0.1mL. Most of your subq injections will come with either a 50iu/0.5mL syringe OR a 1mL syringe. Your PIO/PEO will probably come with a 3mL syringe. Make sure the syringe you’re using will hold the full dose of what you need to inject and try not to use a bigger syringe than necessary. If they’re packaged separately from your medication, it can be helpful to put them in a Ziploc baggy and label them with the size, needle(s) and medication they’re supposed to be used with. Also put the needles you’re supposed to use with them in the bag. By keeping them separated and labelled, it can make your medication prep so much quicker and easier!</p>

<p>I hope this has helped at least a few people and made some people feel more confident and knowledgeable about which needles to use and how to use them. Good luck to everyone!</p>

<p>P.S. If someone would like for me to make a vial drawing video, I can try to do so.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>ETA: If you ever feel insecure about inserting the needle and injecting, buy an orange from the grocery store and use one of your needles and syringes to practice, filling the syringe with water. The orange simulates a similar resistance as skin!</p>

<p>If you are unsure of where to dispose of your sharps containers, this website gives you all the local listings for the US: <a href=""https://safeneedledisposal.org/"">https://safeneedledisposal.org/</a></p>

<p>ETA x 2:
I&#39;ve done a DIY PIO injection video that&#39;s short and sweet and to the point. It does not require you to be really flexible as I certainly am not!</p>

My husband and I are currently exploring donor egg with Shady Grove, but last night he come home to tell me his dentist travels to CNY for her IVF (she is only doing her egg retrieval’s right now), and she was telling him how affordable they are compared to other places.

We are a 6 hourish drive from upstate NY and a pretty quick flight of need be, but I sort of wrote them off because I’ve heard the wait list is long, and inventory isn’t that good.

I told him given how concerned I am with financing the shared risk at Shady Grove I would look into it.

Can anyone help me understand what their pricing includes and doesn’t include (maybe in comparison to shared risk at SG)?

Any clue on the current wait time? I haven’t yet been assigned a donor team at SG (still waiting on that) and before I can do anything I would need to do a mock cycle with them, so it gives me a month or so to potentially change clinics if we wanted to go this route.

My wife (late 30's) and I (early 40's) in california, and have been ttc for about a year now. 3 months ago, we decided to see an IVF specialist given our age and ""lack of progress"". On initial visit, we did ultrasound and found my wife has 9 (total) antral follicles, and gave us a probability of full term pregnancy at 24% on first IVF try, up to 50% on 3rd try. The odds seem low, but we decided to take the next step with ORA test. We just received the 3rd ORA result (FSH:11.2 & estradiol: 45), and the doctor decreased the probability  to 10-11% with 2 embryos transferred. Needless to say, we are both sadden by this news. The doctor said we can go for a 3rd ORA test if we want (wife reasons if first three tests yield similar results - why would a 4th test change). The doctor also said if we want to start the next steps (wife going on birth control), we can do that also. Again, we're both not sure why if the results have been less than ideal. 

Anyways, we want to have a meeting with the doctor - he'll only take questions over the phone and needs us to send questions in advanced. So, we're trying to see what questions to ask... besides why a 4th test and why start birth control if probability is low (perhaps the doctor offers this in case couples want to move ahead even with low probability?)... sorry, we're feeling a bit lost in this topic.

The doctor said we can go for a 3rd ORA test if we want (wife reasons if first three tests yield similar results - why would a 4th test change). The doctor also said if we want to start the next steps (wife going on birth control), we can do that also. Again, we&#39;re both not sure why if the results have been less than ideal. </p>

<p>Anyways, we want to have a meeting with the doctor - he&#39;ll only take questions over the phone and needs us to send questions in advanced. So, we&#39;re trying to see what questions to ask... besides why a 4th test and why start birth control if probability is low (perhaps the doctor offers this in case couples want to move ahead even with low probability?)... sorry, we&#39;re feeling a bit lost in this topic. </p>

I am getting ready for my first round of IVF. As part of that process, I went in today for a saline ultrasound. Emotional Me hoped it would be a pretty quick and easy thing that would result in good prognosis, but Rational Me knew that wasn't going to happen, because no other step in this infertility journey has gone smoothly, so why should this routine procedure be any different?

&#x200B;

Rational Me was correct: they found a uterine polyp. Now, to be clear: I know this is far from the end of the world. I'm confident it can and will be successfully removed. What is making me (perhaps irrationally) angry is that I am just now finding out about it. I have been going to this clinic for almost a year now (happy anniversary to me), and in fact because of that I had to do a full physical today before we even got to the SIS, which ended up contributing significantly to my current state of mind. (You know what isn't going to make that blood pressure reading go down, nurse? You saying Are you nervous and barking RELAX in my face over and over again - especially when it turns out the problem is with your fucking malfunctioning blood pressure reader, not with my actual blood pressure.) In the course of this year of treatment, I had to have a laparotomy to have ten fibroids removed, and as a result of that procedure I have undergone two HSGs and now two SIS procedures (not to mention approx a billion vaginal ultrasounds) -- and you're just NOW telling me about this fucking polyp?

&#x200B;

To be fair - I don't really know anything about polyps, what causes them, how long it takes them to pop up, etc. But I do know that I have spent the last seven months undergoing IUI after IUI, and it's possible that none of them ever really had any real chance of success because of this fucking thing in my uterus, which no one thought to look for. Also, the process of even finding it today was fairly hellacious -- my cervix tends not to cooperate (sits at a weird tilt, plus today it was apparently too stiff for them to penetrate it on the first try, WTF), so they spent a full half hour digging around in there with the speculum before they could even inject the saline to do the ultrasound. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and even so it really fucking hurt. Also, NP asking ""Do you have any questions for me?"" at the end of it -- that is a really fucking good question, because it turns out I do have one, namely, ""Uh.... yeah, did you see anything bad?"" She wasn't even going to tell me about the damn polyp unless I explicitly asked about the results!

&#x200B;

Again, on a rational level I know this is really not a big deal and that other people get MUCH worse news every single day. I'm just pissed at the way it was handled. And I'm just so very, very worn down, as all of us in this sub are, with the cumulative frustration of this infertility journey. And to add one final note of insult to injury, I don't even have a clear idea of where things stand, because the NP said a doctor needs to take a look at the results and weigh in before we can move forward with scheduling a hysteroscopy or whatever ends up being done, and the physician on call is in a different office today and won't be able to get back to me until tomorrow. Never mind that the RE that I am assigned to and have been working with this whole time is physically present, sitting in his office right at that very moment -- why can't he do it and spare me waiting for a phone call???

We’ve now had two failed transfers (one CP, one total negative.) For the first time my RE seems to be starting to wonder if there’s something else we are missing, or if this is just bad luck. It’s pretty much a tossup between the two. We have 5 frozen untested embryos left of varying quality from great (2) to good/fair (3), and have to use at least 3 before we can be approved by insurance for another retrieval. Testing the embryos right now is not an option although if we need another retrieval in the future we will definitely do PGS testing. 

We have two choices:

1) try one more transfer in November (have to wait a cycle in between due to insurance authorization) with no changes other than vaginal estrogen rather than oral to try to plump up a lining that was mostly fine if a little on the thinner side (8mm). If this transfer failed we would start a mock cycle right away in December/January and go from there. 

2) start a mock cycle with my forthcoming period next week, and do two biopsies on “transfer” day: one to test for endometritis and other infections and an ERA. It would likely be done in conjunction with a hysteroscopy. The ERA is experimental and not covered but the rest of the cycle (monitoring, meds, biopsy procedure) would be covered by insurance because of the other biopsy. We would just pay OOP for the ERA fee, I think its $650. If we do this we won’t get results back soon enough to transfer in November, so we’d be looking at a December/January transfer. 

I really thought I’d be leaning more toward the testing than I am. I’m incredibly torn. Statistics say it’s unlikely that I’d have an infection or a displaced transfer window, but they also say I’d be pregnant by now. The thought of waiting that long until next transfer makes me feel sick. But so does the thought that we could just be throwing embryos in and wasting them on a busted uterus. Two failed transfers doesn’t quite feel like the danger zone yet but I’m terrified of how I’ll feel with a few more fails under my belt too. Plus I’m scared about having to do 3 more transfers if both tests come back without any issues. What the heck will we change then? 

This is compounded by the fact that if another retrieval is necessary I’d really like to get that done next plan year. It’s possible that our very generous coverage could be pared down or a deductible added that would impact our ability to afford to continue. Doing one more transfer before getting benched for testing makes that more likely. This is definitely a secondary concern though.

Yesterday we had our IVF consult (YAY) and we went to dinner at my FIL's house. Naturally we were talking about that, everyone knows what we are going through because we are very open about it on facebook and instagram. So we are at dinner and as usual my FIL's fiance facetimes him when she wakes up. She is in the Philippines (citizen there, they met online and have met once for 1 week).

Before I continue, a little background... We are doing IVF because we need to use my husbands frozen sperm from before cancer treatment. We have six vials. Its NOT six samples, its 1 sample split 6 times... so its not much. Not as much as we want anyways but its what we have. My FIL got snipped after my husband was born. FIL is 52, his fiance is about my age (23)... she wants kids.

&#x200B;

Back to the story. She finds out we are over and says to FIL ""OH! Now would be a good time to ask them since we are all here!"" and FIL turns to us and says ""Would we be able to use some of your frozen sperm to have a kid?"" ....... I'm sorry... what. 

&#x200B;

We said no because 1) thats weird 2) don't want my husband to have 2 biological children born near each other and 3) they will not last and 4) THATS REALLY WEIRD... ITS HIS DAD. Well, they looked puzzled as to why we would say no and did ask why and we said it would be rather uncomfortable for us and then FIL asked ""Do you think \[my husband's older brother\] would donate so we could use his?"" ............ I'm just....... WHYYYYYYYYYYY. Why cant he just see about getting that surgery to get the sperm right from his testicles if he wants it so bad instead of asking HIS CHILDREN.

This is confusing as this second test was done on day 7, so I'm thinking it could actually be lower? Regardless, I've scheduled a couple of initial consultations with RE's in my area. I'm 32 and we have been trying for almost 2 years, with 1 pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. 

So, I have some very difficult decisions to make, that I'm sure will become more clear after speaking with an RE, but I also want to hear from all of you, or anyone who might relate to my story. I'm an artist, who has been working in a customer service position for a couple of years now, and am completely miserable at my job. I am planning on starting an interior design program this fall. It's a 1-2 year program that is somewhat flexible in terms of the schedule. I'm so excited to get started, and believe that I would be a great designer. I've struggled with feelings of self-doubt and a lack of confidence and am finally starting to feel like I can do it, thanks to counseling and a very supportive partner.

Now, the difficult decision. My current employer is based in Massachusetts, so my health insurance covers infertility treatments, including donor egg. Which I know is pretty rare. I live in Oregon, where it is not typically covered. We can not afford fertility treatments without my insurance. Because I want to pursue this new career path, I don't want to keep my job after going through this design program. So the tentative plan is to get the RE's opinion, and if they recommend donor egg, going for it right away. 

I keep seeing comments from women who want to exhaust all of the possibility of using their own eggs before pursuing donor eggs, which makes total sense. What if I decide to use donor eggs right away, and then conceive naturally some day? How will that affect our family and the children? I honestly don't see myself being able to handle the ups and downs of multiple IVF attempts, and I don't want to work at my current job for another two years, because it's quite depressing. If I DON'T go the donor egg route, I could never have children. Which, I think that I would be fine with but might regret. Another reason why I am interested in using donor eggs is because there is a pretty strong history of mental illness in my family. I have also struggled with anxiety and depression, and the thought of having a child who will struggle in the same way, really concerns me. 

I know that you all can't make this decision for me, but I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Am I giving up on my body or just grieving the loss of a potential biological child?

I had a previous post, but I didn't like how I phrased it.

When I first started IF treatment a year ago, another user posted what her protocol looked like and what her results were. I found it helpful because it was hard to find an example of a day-by-day stimming protocol online. It also help to set expectations.

One thing to note is that because we had to do PGD testing, our RE didn't give us Day 3 or Day 5 updates. She only told us which ones were eligible for biopsy (i.e. which ones were hatching blastocysts that looked good enough to biopsy). She told us that this criteria is stricter than simply freezing embryos that make it to day 5. 

Sometimes I read posts by women wondering if they should do another cycle. And I kind of wonder to myself, what if my cycles had been in a different order? What if IVF #1 happened, then IVF #3? I'd be terrified and deeply concerned. I definitely recommend at least 3 egg retrievals, if you can afford it. That's just my .02.

I also know some women have done the same protocol three times! Without changing things. I hope this also helps to illuminate the difference a change in protocol can make. Or really, just how cycles can vary one from the other. **IVF is far from an exact science.**

Some other things I observed:

* My estradiol was regularly above 2,000 at trigger. Apparently this isn't normal, as my doctor and the nurses commented on this often when they looked at my charts. I didn't experience any OSHH, just weeklong constipation.
* My lead follicle was only 17.5 mm for my best cycle (IVF #2). I was terrified when they told me to trigger because everywhere online, it said a minimum of 18 or 20 was recommended.
* You can fall on any side of the statistics. As I've mentioned before in this subreddit, statistically, only 25% of our embryos should have the disease my husband and I are carriers for. However, in practice, 58% of them have the disease. ",t2_so2wn,False,,0,False,Data from my multiple egg retrievals,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_9gm15k,False,dark,0.9,,public,19,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,19,,False,self,1537203388.0,,[],{},,True,,1537231863.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Data can be found <a href=""http://theinfertilityhandbook.com/2018/07/28/all-of-my-ivf-cycles-by-the-numbers/"">here</a>.</p>

I've been following this sub for well over a year and was excited to finally start active treatment. I'm quite anxious by nature, but having been well informed about what to expect (thanks to all of you) has made this process so much easier for me. We went straight to IVF because of my diagnosis and the length of time we have been trying making it unlikely to find success with IUI. I responded well to the drugs, had no side effects except for feeling a bit bloated toward the end, had nicely rising estrogen levels, and a good number of follicles around and above 20 mm. 

I just had my first egg retrieval on Friday. Everything went great and I was told that they were able to retrieve 17 eggs. Sadly, the hunger games hit me hard and early. I missed Saturday's call and was informed via voicemail that, while 16 of the 17 eggs were mature, only 2(!) fertilized normally. We are pretty devastated already and doubt there will even be any left to transfer. 

The only upside here is that thanks to my eternal pessimism we signed up for a Shared Risk program. So I know that we can and will try again and it will ""only"" cost us the price of the medications this time. However, I would really like to know what could have caused such a low rate of fertilization (12.5%). I've been googling and searching this sub all weekend but haven't come across a clear answer as to whether this is most likely due to egg quality or sperm issues. My husband's first semen analysis wasn't exactly stellar but not too worrisome either. And his more recent one was better. I have been taking supplements (including CoQ10, Myo-Inositol, Maca, Acai, and Resveratrol for improving egg quality) for months before starting IVF. 

I'm currently awaiting the phone call with my day 3 update and will ask my RE the same question. But I was just wondering if any of you had any input. Here are all of our stats and relevant background information, in case anyone wants to know lol!

I posted here a few days ago saying I didn't think I had ovulated because I'd had none of my normal symptoms after O (This is my last UNMONITORED clomid cycle because F*CK being unmonitored anymore!!) 


Last clomid cycle I got a 'nearly positive OPK' and pretty much everyone on the lineporn subreddit was saying it wasn't fully positive and not to count it. 2 days after that I did indeed ovulate. I almost missed it honestly because I didn't have much EWCM. I can't even really describe it as EWCM because it was sort of chunky but still stretchy and slippery. 
I tend to get sore nipples literally the day after ovulation, and last cycle I got the tiniest amount of soreness ever. (I'm aware it's something to do with Progesterone, but how come when I'm not taking Clomid my after O nips KILL but on my Clomid cycles they don't??)
I also didn't get a big temp jump. My temps went up to 97.34. I was honestly convinced I had not ovulated and I spent a week terrified/almost crying thinking Clomid had totally failed me, but 12 days after FF predicted I had ovulated (And all of these symptoms) my period arrived and it was what I would describe as a 'normal' period. Usually, when I haven't ovulated my periods are very light and don't hurt at all - I know the difference between a no o period and an o period, basically.


It's been similar again this cycle. I was so convinced I had not ovulated and wouldn't ovulate. I got the 'kinda' EWCM 3 days ago, I got a 'nearly positive' OPK at the same time. 
Yesterday evening my nipples began to hurt slightly, again not majorly, I was actually doubting if they really did hurt or I was imagining it.


This morning I took my temp and it has spiked. Yet again only to 97.34, but it definitely has gone up. I have the worlds lowest temps before O. My average temp when I haven't ovulated is something like 96.52.


Has anyone else noticed this with Clomid? Everyone told me that Clomid would cause 'stronger ovulation' but for me it hasn't at all. If anything, ovulation seems nowhere near as strong. My symptoms are barely there at all, to the point it makes me believe Clomid has failed. My temp rises higher when I ovulate on my own, unmedicated. I also get more EWCM and stronger hormonal symptoms.

We are way too far out to know how quickly his time away will ramp up.    
I'm freaking out a little because this means that starting next year we might have cycles that get cancelled due to him being away or would have to use frozen samples from him. Has anyone else had to plan treatment around work travel schedules that take you away from each other?

I don't have family in the area myself so I will have to get my own support network squared away before then. I will have to coordinate and go to all these meetings, family support groups and social events with the SAH military spouses and their gaggles of kids.

When we were deciding to do IVF we switched REs and I brought up suspected endo to which he agreed with.  I decided to have an excision lap in August. My RE would have preferred depot lupron for 3 months to not risk any damage to my ovary but after researching it I felt that I was more comfortable with the surgery. Stage 3/4 endo was removed (no endometriomas). I went for an AFC three weeks post op and was relieved when they counted 5 on the R, 0 on the L (my left is always stingy but usually musters up a follicle or two when stims start) since more endo was removed on my right side. I'm starting my third and final IVF in a week. My RE is hopeful that I will respond the same or better. My July cycle   
 was a bit of a mess since 3 of the eggs were still in the GV stage, which my RE said is an endo sign. We're doing the same protocol (I kinda wanted to try MDL but my RE is not a fan for whatever reason). Hoping for more mature eggs this round!

Anyone have experience with IVF post excision, the good or bad? I'm hopeful that the surgery will help with the egg quality but I also know IVF is a crap shoot. Hoping we get a blast or two so we can try a fresh transfer. Thanks in advance!!
