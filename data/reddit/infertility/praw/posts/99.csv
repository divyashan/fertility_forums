My  wife (Licensed Mental Health Counselor, Doctoral Candidate) is doing   her dissertation study on dyadic effects (basically how each affects the   other) of infertility on individuals in the relationship, and the   relationship as a whole.

Essentially,   there is a HUGE gap in mental health counseling regarding the ongoing,   daily trauma that is the struggle with infertility. She's hoping this   study can help inform techniques, workshops, and new areas of study   regarding this.

She's looking for a large sum of **individuals and their partners** to participate (really focused on couple participants), and **it's just a survey**. If it's not an inappropriate ask, I'd like to share this study in case members were interested in participating. It's a short process (15-20  minutes), and for every survey completed, $1 is donated to your choice  of ASRM, Fertility for Colored Girls, or Resolve.

*For the sake of members who are struggling with the difficult feelings that come with infertility, all positive pregnancy test results and pregnancy discussion are only allowed in this thread.*

Posts that are appropriate for this thread:

* Positive HPT and beta results

* Updates of on-going beta results. Update your original post in the thread by editing. Do not make a new post within the same thread.

* Ultrasound updates with the following caveats. If pregnancy had been measuring on track and continues to do so, an update may be given stating that the “results were positive”. Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.

* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.

Posts that are not appropriate for this thread:

* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.

* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).

* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).

* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*

* Responding “Thank You!” to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.

*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

We’ve struggled with infertility for about 7 years now. Two years ago my wife went through IUI. The first round resulted in a chemical pregnancy, the second round didn’t work. 

We were both very upset. She decided to take a break from IUI. The break went on for months until she told me the entire fertility process was too difficult for her to handle (emotionally, chemically, physically) and that she wanted to look into adoption.

My feeling was that that last round of IUI was a positive thing and showed that we could potentially have success with IUI. But this isn’t my body. I won’t be the one receiving everything that goes with IUI (or IVF, which obviously scares her the most). I was ready to explore adoption if that’s what she wanted to do. 

We took the classes and did the home study. Did everything required to get a prepared. The more I read, the more I understood the nuances in the adoption world. The savior complexes, trauma, competition, and emotional strain. 

And not to mention the cost (domestic infant adoption costs about the same as 3-4 rounds of IVF).

We went down the adoption route for over a year and learned a lot about that world. We learned quickly it isn’t a solution to infertility. It’s a world of trauma and people doing the very best they can in a shitty situation. 

After many adoption situations and a few failed matches, my wife is saying adoption is too emotionally draining to pursue and she’s now regretting stopping fertility treatment so early. But I can tell she’s on unsure if she’s capable emotionally of doing any fertility treatment. 

I’m scared she’s making decisions out of fear and that there’s nothing I can do to help her. She is so much stronger than she’s sometimes gives herself herself credit. But I also know this emotionally taxing beyond anything I’ll ever be able to understand. 

I just want to be there for her and it’s hard to know if I’m doing it right. 

I didn’t expect to write this much, sorry. My main questions for anyone still reading:

Does a chemical pregnancy during IUI indicate something positive, negative or neutral during fertility treatment? 

Are there any tips anyone can suggest for me to talk to me wife about this? In the end, I’ll always defer to her and I’m ready to follow her on whatever path she chooses. But I also feel like we were very early in fertility before we changed course and that it could’ve been the right choice all along.

I'll try to keep it short.

I'm 31 and my wife is 30. We're highschool sweethearts and we've been together for 13 years now.

We've been married for a year. Lately my wife went to a gynécologist because of severe period pains and we discovered that she has PCOS.

In the meantime, I started thinking about my fertility so my urologist told me to take a test.

I discovered in august that I have asthenospermia (20% mortility) and it shocked me to my core.

My shipping time from Israel was exactly 2 weeks from placing my order to receiving meds, 11 days of that in transit.

August 28 - I ordered from IVFPharmacy, emailing them my paper prescription and sent money through Zelle. 

August 29 - they contacted me to confirm that even with projected shipping times up to 21 days (due to delays), the meds could reach me in time. They offered an alternative earlier shipping time of 7 days via a pharmacy in Turkey for some medications, but not one that I needed. They were also super helpful in confirming the medication and whether I needed injection pens, etc.

Sept 1 - My delivery shipped from their facility in Israel, via international mail and USPS Priority Mail

Sept 8 - it arrived in NY customs

Sept 10 - Customs released it to USPS

At 38 (August) I visited a highly popular, and I assume renowned RE/IVF doctor, and over the past few months through bloodwork uncovered I have PCOS (FSH 7.8, LH 17.1, estradiol 40, AMH 11.57) and my partner M[40] has bad sperm (Normal form sperm 1%, concentration 5.0 million/ml, progressive motility 17%[rapid 9%] - so it's bad news all all 3 measurements of the sperm analysis, all my other tests normal (TSH, Vit D, prolactin, STI screens). 


Our RE said he doesn't recommend IUI. He ordered an advanced analysis on the sperm called a ""stress test"" and said we'll have to wait to see results before he can speak to the efficacy of IVF. He offered no explanation on why the sperm analysis results were so poor other than it could have happened at any point in my partners life and it's not necessarily a sign of other bodily issues.

 I had 4 follicles, 2 of size. 

Im 33 (34 next month). Amh is 9.something and fsh bounces around month to month but is within the levels my clinics considers normal or ok. 

We are unexplained. We've been trying a few years now including 4 IO cycles. I've taken between 25-75 of gonal f for each and responded well in terms of what we were aiming for. Months I used 50 or 75 of gonal I got 2 full size follicles each time. Lining always 10+

Lab called today and said that it hasn’t reached blastocyst stage, but is still a morula as of today. Currently about 80 cells and no fragmentation. So they’ll be calling tomorrow with another update and if it makes it to blastocyst tomorrow, will send biopsy sample for testing. 😬

Today, I went in for a hysteroscopy in preparation for FET#3. My RE discovered I have a septate uterus, which is congenital. Here's the thing: after 2.5 years of treatment with 5 different experts, I would think someone would have noticed this before, no? Here's a brief summary:

RE#1 (2018): HSG performed; tubes clear. 2 failed IUIs with Clomid.

RE#2 (2019): 1 failed IUI with Femara. Mock transfer performed prior to FET#1; FET#1 with PGS failed; Flexible hysteroscopy performed to test for endometrisis and investigate for suspected adenomyosis; sent for MRI with adeno confirmed by lab report and RE; put on 3 months of Depot Lupron to prep for FET#2; FET#2 with PGS ended in chemical with low beta

Nook Doctor (Feb 2020) to investigate adeno; doctor isn't certain about adeno diagnosis after reviewing MRI images.

RE#3 (Spring 2020): Performed a hysteroscopy but it was so brief. Was in there for less than 30 seconds. Doctor disagreed with adenomyosis diagnosis after viewing MRI images.

RE #4 (Spring/Summer 2020): RE performed saline ultrasound a few months ago; stated my uterus was beautiful; same RE performed today’s hysteroscopy.

I also should point out that yes--I've hopped around a lot. I left RE#1 due to insurance coverage; left RE#2 because they weren't willing to do anything different after 2 failed transfers; left RE#3 because clinic is 1,000 miles away and choose to stay local after ER was canceled on Stim Day 11

I guess I can use any wisdom from what you've read here. On one hand, I'm wondering if this is my issue, and explains my failures.

The very short version of my increasingly complicated backstory is that I have now had 3 missed miscarriages (spontaneous conceptions), all with possible molar features. The pathology on my first two losses was analyzed by three different health systems and the final, most authoritative conclusion was that they were not molar. I also went through genetic testing to determine that I do not have any known mutations association with recurrent molar pregnancy. I was unable to have the POC from my first loss tested. My second loss was euploid. My third loss will go through Natera as well.

My third loss was identified via ultrasound yesterday at 6+4. There was a very misshapen gestational sac, a yolk sac was visible (no idea if the size was normal), and a fetal pole measuring 6+1, no heartbeat. A new doctor in a new health system this time around reached the same conclusion: ""it looks like it could be a molar pregnancy.""

I'm having a d&c tomorrow. The tissue will go to pathology and to Natera for analysis. I'm hoping it's just simply an issue of aneuploidy. If it isn't, I'm left with serious concerns about the possibility of ever having a successful pregnancy.

I currently have three frozen euploid embryos unaffected by BRCA1. I was originally planning to do an FET before this latest spontaneous pregnancy. However, given this third loss with abnormal features, I am skeptical as to what my body will do to those embryos I worked so hard to create. Is there something wrong with my genetics/my husband's?

I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions on what I should push my doctors to look into next. I already had a full RPL panel after my second loss and nothing was identified.

(So far I only did a carrier screening for a huge laundry list of disorders like cystic fibrosis, etc.) For those of you with RPL, what were your next steps?</p>

FET #1 (March 2020): 10 mg Estrace daily (3 oral, 2 vaginal) for \~21 days. Lining got to 7.3 mm. PIO (1 ml) and Prometrium (200 mg 2x/day) for 5 days, then transfer. Also did Z-pak for 5 days before transfer and Valium day-of. Beta of 0.

I did an ERA in May 2020, which came back 24 hours pre-receptive. Also did ReceptivaDx - negative. Then discovered scar tissue in my uterus the next month (scarring seems to come back for me after a septum resection surgery I had in May 2019). Did an operative hysteroscopy in June 2020, plus 2 follow-up hysteroscopies in July & August to ensure no new scarring. The June 2020 hysteroscopy was my third operative hysteroscopy so I wanted to make ***totally*** sure there were no new adhesions.  Both follow-ups were clear, and I felt good that my uterus was finally in good shape.

FET #2 (August 2020): .4 ml Estradiol Valerate every 3 days for \~22 days. Lining got to 8.4 mm. PIO (1 ml) and Prometrium (200 mg 2x/day) for 6 days, then transfer. Also did Z-pak for 5 days before transfer and Valium day-of. Beta of 0.

Both embryos were PGS-tested, 5AA.  I have 7 more PGS normals left.

I am beyond frustrated. I really thought the ERA and scar tissue removal would be the tickets for me.

I got a second opinion almost immediately after discovering FET #2 failed. She discussed a kitchen sink protocol for next time: intralipid infusions, HGH for lining prep, Lovenox, prednisone. My current RE suggested a medicated cycle with Lovenox. He said that's the only add-on that is evidence-based, but he'd be willing to add the prednisone as a can't hurt situation.

Current RE also suggested a natural cycle with Letrazole, which he said may help the embryo stick (something about beta-integrin, I did not catch all of that). He said he'd want to try a natural cycle just to see what my body does. He said there's no difference in outcome in natural vs. medicated cycles.

As you can see from my FET protocols, it takes my lining a long time to grow, even on high amounts of estrogen. When not using exogenous estrogen, my lining is usually thin: 6.9 ish during stims (with E2 about 8000), 5.5 during an IUI, 6.9 during another IUI. I am scared if I do a natural cycle there is pretty much no way in hell my lining will get above 8 on my own and in 14-17 days. RE correctly notes all those data points are from before the removal of scar tissue, so we never know what my lining will do now that the scarring is (presumably) gone.

My questions:

**Has anyone with thin lining had luck with a natural cycle after failed medicated cycles? Do you think it's worth trying in my case?**

**What is the benefit of trying a natural cycle? Is it just to see how your lining does, or is it a thing where the embryo is more likely to implant on a natural cycle?**

**Do you think a medicated kitchen sink protocol would be better in my case?**

Thanks, guys.

133,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"This is my first reddit post ever, but I really needed to vent my frustration. I've been creeping this sub for a long time so this is kind of an intro/miscarriage story. Sorry for the length!

My husband and I have been married for 4 years, and have been TTC for our entire marriage. We were referred to the only fertility clinic that services our entire province, and after a 6 month wait we finally had an appointment at the clinic. At that time our doctor was able to rule out MFI. I've known that I have had PCOS since I was a teenager, and in my 20's hit over 300 lbs. I knew that I had to lose weight to be able to better my chances get pregnant and have lost over 100 lbs, but still am categorised as overweight. So we both knew going into this that the PCOS was likely going to play a factor. After a HSG they determined that one of my tubes had a blockage, but my doctor said that ultimately there was only about a 20% chance that she would be able to clear it, so at that point I declined to have it treated. 

We went on to do 10 rounds of Letrozole over the course of a year and a half. No success. At the time it felt emotionally exhausting, but we were naive and had no idea how much harder things would get. 

Last October after we had finished the last unsuccessful round of Letrozole we met with the doctor again, and discussed what route to take next. She suggested IUI, however, with the blocked tube, this made the likelihood of fertilisation being able to take place greatly decreased, so we opted to go straight to IVF. Our first ER was in the beginning of February. Because of the PCOS they were really challenged with getting me on the right dosage. Once retrieval day came they were able to get 12 from my left and nothing from my right. There were actually 16 on the right, but because of the placement of my ovary that day they were unable to get at it. I remember the frustration in my doctor's voice after having to finally give up. I ended up with OHSS, and we were unable to a fresh transfer. The 12 dwindled down to 3 5-day blastocysts that were all frozen. Once my levels had calmed down, we planned for a March transfer and then..... COVID. We were set up for our scan prior to setting up the date for the first transfer and I got a call at work letting me know that they were closing down the clinic until further notice. I was gutted. It felt like one more roadblock, but I understood the reasoning and we just waited.

Finally in June I was set up for my first transfer in July. My husband and I were so excited. I was feeling nothing but positivity and I thought that if I just radiated positivity we would manifest a baby. Transfer day came and went without a hitch. I started testing 9dpt and got a faint positive. The positives remained faint throughout the wait until my blood draw. I was feeling good, I mean after all, every woman I knew who was in my ""bubble"" told me that ""a faint positive is a positive"". Well, I call bullshit on that. My beta came back at a 15. I was gutted. But I had to do the follow up 2 days later, which came back at 0. Our doctor confirmed that it was a chemical pregnancy and tried to make me feel better by telling me that it was a better sign than not having a positive at all. 

So we pushed on. Had our 2nd FET on Aug. 5th. Of course, like a impatient child I started testing again, but this time I started testing 7dpt. Solid positive. Became more and more positive. Beta came back at 292. I was so excited. I remember the scream of pure joy my husband made when I called him at work to tell him the good news. We told the people in our immediate bubble. I started hesitantly looking at baby items and reading all of the pregnancy books I'd purchased and hidden in the closet over the years. I was feeling very cautiously optimistic. For the first time in my life I was having pregnancy symptoms. I was nauseous, my breasts were sore, my sense of smell was insanely strong. Our doctor put me back on TV progesterone, as well as the intramuscular injection. I was sore, and tired but I felt like it would all work out. Then one day at about 5 wks I started having brown discharge. The nurses assured me that it was due to the blood flow increasing to my cervix from the TV progesterone, and not to worry. The following weekend I noticed more blood. Like red blood, not heavy enough to be period-like, but enough that I was terrified. My husband called the on-call doctor and he brought us in the next day to do an ultrasound.

The ultrasound brought us some momentary peace of mind. He said that he could see the gestational sac, and the yolk sac, but no fetal pole. He detected no bleeding in the uterus and reassured us that the bleeding came from the cervix. Again, we were told not to worry, go for blood work the next day and let them know if anything changes. The next day I had more bleeding and my HCG came back lower than they anticipated, so they wanted another test 2 days out. So Wednesday of last week I had another blood draw. They said that my HCG hadn't doubled, but was still increasing, so unless anything changed to relax. On Thursday I woke up for work and noticed similar bleeding, messaged the nurses to let them know and set off for work.  I drove out to one of our job sites that's about 2 hours outside of the city, and during the drive I didn't feel right. When I stood up to get out of the car I felt a huge rush of blood, and ran into the restroom. I noticed a large clot and completely lost it. I was sure at that point I was miscarrying. I drove what felt like the longest, most lonely drive of my life. I called my husband, crying and trying to focus on keeping the car on the road. He contacted the clinic, at which point they sent me for another blood test before deciding on next steps. My HCG was continuing to increase.... slowly. 

Because of the increase in my HCG, the asked us to come in for an ultrasound on Saturday. We spent all of Thursday and Friday crying and preparing for the inevitable. I asked my husband to contact all of our bubble people and tell them what was going on. Saturday morning I sobbed as I got myself together and we made our way to the ultrasound. Because of COVID regulations, I was in the ultrasound by myself. The doctor said he could still see the gestational sac, the yolk sac and now a fetal pole. He said that everything was measuring about 1 week and 1 day behind. I asked what all of the bleeding and clots were from and again, he said likely from the cervix. He was very honest with us and said it was possible that the baby would ""catch up"" and continue to grow, or that my body would do what it would have to do if the baby was not viable. He said if the latter was to happen to go to the hospital immediately. He asked me to take 2 weeks of bed rest, and the same old ""let me know if anything changes""

We were in shock. I was convinced that the clot I had passed was the baby. We didn't know whether to be excited or terrified. It was a momentary sense of relief, but now fear that it wouldn't continue to grow. I was exhausted mentally and physically. Yesterday afternoon I had a nap, and when I woke up I could feel a rush of blood. I yelled for my husband, and the expression on his face when he saw me there, blood all over my legs and the floor. Stupidly I asked him for a basin. I needed to see what was happening. And unfortunately, I could see that I had passed the tissue of what would have been our baby. I was shaking bloody mess. My husband rushed me to the hospital, where I had to wait alone (again, these damn COVID restrictions) to find out that yes, we had miscarried. The ER doctor was lovely, but very matter of fact. As she was asking me questions I kept getting that lump in my throat where I found myself choking on my own words. She sent me on my way with some T3s and some zopiclone to sleep. 

Flash forward to today, it's a stat holiday here so the clinic is closed but the on call nurse got in touch to see how I'm doing. They need to monitor my HCG to make sure it's going down to zero, and want to have a conference call with my doctor about what's next. We still have 1 frozen. I don't know how to feel about any of this anymore. Of course we'll transfer this one, but then what?

Once retrieval day came they were able to get 12 from my left and nothing from my right. There were actually 16 on the right, but because of the placement of my ovary that day they were unable to get at it. I remember the frustration in my doctor&#39;s voice after having to finally give up. I ended up with OHSS, and we were unable to a fresh transfer. The 12 dwindled down to 3 5-day blastocysts that were all frozen. Once my levels had calmed down, we planned for a March transfer and then..... COVID. We were set up for our scan prior to setting up the date for the first transfer and I got a call at work letting me know that they were closing down the clinic until further notice. I was gutted. It felt like one more roadblock, but I understood the reasoning and we just waited.</p>

<p>Finally in June I was set up for my first transfer in July. My husband and I were so excited. I was feeling nothing but positivity and I thought that if I just radiated positivity we would manifest a baby. Transfer day came and went without a hitch. I started testing 9dpt and got a faint positive. The positives remained faint throughout the wait until my blood draw. I was feeling good, I mean after all, every woman I knew who was in my &quot;bubble&quot; told me that &quot;a faint positive is a positive&quot;. Well, I call bullshit on that. My beta came back at a 15. I was gutted. But I had to do the follow up 2 days later, which came back at 0. Our doctor confirmed that it was a chemical pregnancy and tried to make me feel better by telling me that it was a better sign than not having a positive at all. </p>

<p>So we pushed on. Had our 2nd FET on Aug. 5th. Of course, like a impatient child I started testing again, but this time I started testing 7dpt. Solid positive. Became more and more positive. Beta came back at 292. I was so excited. I remember the scream of pure joy my husband made when I called him at work to tell him the good news. We told the people in our immediate bubble. I started hesitantly looking at baby items and reading all of the pregnancy books I&#39;d purchased and hidden in the closet over the years. I was feeling very cautiously optimistic. For the first time in my life I was having pregnancy symptoms. I was nauseous, my breasts were sore, my sense of smell was insanely strong. Our doctor put me back on TV progesterone, as well as the intramuscular injection. I was sore, and tired but I felt like it would all work out. Then one day at about 5 wks I started having brown discharge. The nurses assured me that it was due to the blood flow increasing to my cervix from the TV progesterone, and not to worry. The following weekend I noticed more blood. Like red blood, not heavy enough to be period-like, but enough that I was terrified. My husband called the on-call doctor and he brought us in the next day to do an ultrasound.</p>

<p>The ultrasound brought us some momentary peace of mind. He said that he could see the gestational sac, and the yolk sac, but no fetal pole. He detected no bleeding in the uterus and reassured us that the bleeding came from the cervix. Again, we were told not to worry, go for blood work the next day and let them know if anything changes. The next day I had more bleeding and my HCG came back lower than they anticipated, so they wanted another test 2 days out. So Wednesday of last week I had another blood draw. They said that my HCG hadn&#39;t doubled, but was still increasing, so unless anything changed to relax. On Thursday I woke up for work and noticed similar bleeding, messaged the nurses to let them know and set off for work.  I drove out to one of our job sites that&#39;s about 2 hours outside of the city, and during the drive I didn&#39;t feel right. When I stood up to get out of the car I felt a huge rush of blood, and ran into the restroom. I noticed a large clot and completely lost it. I was sure at that point I was miscarrying. I drove what felt like the longest, most lonely drive of my life. I called my husband, crying and trying to focus on keeping the car on the road. He contacted the clinic, at which point they sent me for another blood test before deciding on next steps. My HCG was continuing to increase.... slowly. </p>

<p>Because of the increase in my HCG, the asked us to come in for an ultrasound on Saturday. We spent all of Thursday and Friday crying and preparing for the inevitable. I asked my husband to contact all of our bubble people and tell them what was going on. Saturday morning I sobbed as I got myself together and we made our way to the ultrasound. Because of COVID regulations, I was in the ultrasound by myself. The doctor said he could still see the gestational sac, the yolk sac and now a fetal pole. He said that everything was measuring about 1 week and 1 day behind. I asked what all of the bleeding and clots were from and again, he said likely from the cervix. He was very honest with us and said it was possible that the baby would &quot;catch up&quot; and continue to grow, or that my body would do what it would have to do if the baby was not viable. He said if the latter was to happen to go to the hospital immediately. He asked me to take 2 weeks of bed rest, and the same old &quot;let me know if anything changes&quot;</p>

<p>We were in shock. I was convinced that the clot I had passed was the baby. We didn&#39;t know whether to be excited or terrified. It was a momentary sense of relief, but now fear that it wouldn&#39;t continue to grow. I was exhausted mentally and physically. Yesterday afternoon I had a nap, and when I woke up I could feel a rush of blood. I yelled for my husband, and the expression on his face when he saw me there, blood all over my legs and the floor. Stupidly I asked him for a basin. I needed to see what was happening. And unfortunately, I could see that I had passed the tissue of what would have been our baby. I was shaking bloody mess. My husband rushed me to the hospital, where I had to wait alone (again, these damn COVID restrictions) to find out that yes, we had miscarried. The ER doctor was lovely, but very matter of fact. As she was asking me questions I kept getting that lump in my throat where I found myself choking on my own words. She sent me on my way with some T3s and some zopiclone to sleep. </p>

<p>Flash forward to today, it&#39;s a stat holiday here so the clinic is closed but the on call nurse got in touch to see how I&#39;m doing. They need to monitor my HCG to make sure it&#39;s going down to zero, and want to have a conference call with my doctor about what&#39;s next. We still have 1 frozen. I don&#39;t know how to feel about any of this anymore. Of course we&#39;ll transfer this one, but then what? They physical, emotional and financial toll this has all taken is far greater than I could have ever imagined.</p>

Vague and sensitive mentions to ""success"" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies ""I had success with A,B,C""). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.

**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses ""blessed"", ""miraculously,"" ""easily conceived"", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.

**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down.

Sex, embryos, and sperm. These are the correct terms. **Infertility isn't cute**, and neither are the terms we use. Our sub prefers that these acronyms/terms are not used. If you trigger the automod, review this post and then edit out the offending content.

150,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Disclosure: I have also published my story on other subs. My only intention is to gather as information as I can from people’s personal experiences. If you come across my story on other subs, please don’t mind. I am only seeking for all the help I can get. Thank you! 

This is my story trying to complete my family with a baby. My husband and I were so naive in taking the next chapter of our life for granted. Year 2017, 3 years into our marriage, we started trying to get pregnant and very soon I tested positive. But our happiness was short lived, ending with a miscarriage. My husband and I were 31 at the time. As devastating as it was, we found that miscarriage is, unfortunately, a very common occurrence in many pregnancies. We wanted to try again and were happy to get pregnant for the 2nd time. But it ended with a miscarriage again. For the 2nd time, we were heart broken. This went on for 2 more miscarriages, in total 4 miscarriages, until Sep 2019. The cause for these 4 miscarriages is still a mystery. Were they ectopic, was there any genetic issue, we can only guess.

Sep 2019, I tested positive again. By this time, I was in touch with a family practitioner. I went for a blood test to check for HCG count. Unfortunately it was low, around 197. My doctor was doubtful of a successful pregnancy. She did another blood work, with HCG count around 250 and another one after that with HCG count around 200. With such a roller coaster of HCG, the doctor prescribed medication to induce miscarriage. However, even after a week, I did not miscarry. It was Oct 2019, I was 8 weeks pregnant, unable to sustain, unable to miscarry and then it happened. We finished dinner and were ready to go to bed and suddenly I started having excruciating pain in the right side of my abdomen. Unable to bear the pain, my husband rushed me to the emergency where I was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy. My right fallopian tube had ruptured and I had accumulated a lot of blood internally. I was rushed for an emergency laparoscopic surgery to remove the ruptured tube and clean the blood. Fortunately, I had a speedy recovery. This was our first ever experience with ectopic pregnancy. Neither us nor the doctor ever suspected it, even though the HCG level was so erratic. The doctor had also diagnosed increased levels of thyroid. This was such a blunder and we always wonder if the rupture could have been avoided, should we have received better care, should we have done some research, should we have been more alert. On my doctor’s part, not checking for an ectopic pregnancy and not handling it the right way, like using methotrexate, was a big oversight to say the least. The one which could have cost me my life.

My husband and I tried to learn as much as possible about ectopic pregnancy, cause, symptoms, remedies, all of it. We also came in touch with a specialized ObGyn and an infertility specialist. We were all ready to go for IVF. We were trying to learn all about IVF and then it happened again. Aug 2020, I tested positive again. We have never been any more scared than seeing those 2 lines on the take home test. We immediately rushed to see my ObGyn. Multiple HCG tests were done. HCG levels started from 104, and within a week climbed to 1030. Early ultrasound did not reveal anything, no sack, no internal bleeding, nothing. The doctor said they were not expecting to see anything at the time and is not an indication to worry. The initial HCG level of 104 was worrisome, but once the level reached 1030, the doctor was more comfortable and was expecting it to be a normal pregnancy. This time we were also in touch with a fertility specialist, for a 2nd opinion. Both doctors arrived at the same conclusion, shouldn’t be ectopic. The doctor was aware of my thyroid issue. So they kept a close eye on thyroid levels. She also checked for my progesterone level and found it to be a little low. She prescribed me medication to help increase progesterone. 

One week later, the HCG levels jumped to approximately 8000. We were starting to get a little happy, but were still worried since the location of the implantation was not yet confirmed. Another ultrasound was done and it quickly became the day when all hopes, dreams & aspirations crashed to pieces. Our worst fear had come true. It was an ectopic pregnancy again. I was 7.5 weeks pregnant at the time. However the tube was intact, which gave us some hope and relief. After discussion with the doctor to weigh all options, my husband, I and the doctor decided to use methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. I got methotrexate through an injection. Also, another HCG test was done to get the updated count. It was at approximately 18000+. The doctor quickly realized that the levels were too high for the methotrexate to be effective on time and made the call to perform the laparoscopic surgery to remove the pregnancy. She assured me that she will do her best to preserve the fallopian tube. But she could not. I lost my only hope, I lost my second and only remaining tube.

At the time of writing my story, I am on the path to recover from the surgery. Meanwhile I am also trying to gather all I can about IVF. Trying to understand if that’s still an option for me. I am scared if my body can still go through the process, after 4 miscarriages and 2 ectopics with surgeries and no fallopian tubes. In all of the hopelessness, in all of the uncertainty, the only thing unchanged is that we want to have a baby. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has had similar experience can share their story with me. It would mean a lot if anyone can help me answer my questions.

A little bit of background, my husband & I are 34 years old. We are both non-smokers, non-drinkers and have never done drugs of any sort. We don’t have any life-style diseases, like blood pressure or diabetes etc, nor do we have any other health issues in general, except for my thyroids for which I take medication. No one in both our families had any infertility issue. Up until the world shut down due to COVID-19, we used to workout at least 3-4 hours per week. We have never had any other sexual partner than each other.

Some of my questions, if anyone can help me answer:

1. If anyone had a similar problem like me, where they lost both fallopian tubes, is it still safe to go for IVF? To put it very bluntly, can IVF for people like me be life threatening since the body has already been through so much?
2. Again for someone with a similar problem like me, what was the success rate? How many attempts did it take to get pregnant? Was the pregnancy healthy?
3. In general, does IVF have any long term health effects? Since they inject a lot of hormones, can they cause long term issues?
4. When speaking to a IVF specialist, what questions should we ask? What information should we try to understand?
5. This is a location based question. We live in Seattle, WA, USA. Which fertility clinic or which IVF specialist should we go to? There are quite a few around and it would really help to get peoples first hand experience. Also what was the true cost of IVF?",t2_7mzsxut1,False,,0,False,Ectopics - a shadow on our life,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_ins558,False,dark,0.56,,public,1,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Treatment Advice,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1599448908.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Disclosure: I have also published my story on other subs.

<p>This is my story trying to complete my family with a baby. My husband and I were so naive in taking the next chapter of our life for granted. Year 2017, 3 years into our marriage, we started trying to get pregnant and very soon I tested positive. But our happiness was short lived, ending with a miscarriage. My husband and I were 31 at the time. As devastating as it was, we found that miscarriage is, unfortunately, a very common occurrence in many pregnancies. We wanted to try again and were happy to get pregnant for the 2nd time. But it ended with a miscarriage again. For the 2nd time, we were heart broken. This went on for 2 more miscarriages, in total 4 miscarriages, until Sep 2019. The cause for these 4 miscarriages is still a mystery. Were they ectopic, was there any genetic issue, we can only guess.</p>

<p>Sep 2019, I tested positive again. By this time, I was in touch with a family practitioner. I went for a blood test to check for HCG count. Unfortunately it was low, around 197. My doctor was doubtful of a successful pregnancy. She did another blood work, with HCG count around 250 and another one after that with HCG count around 200. With such a roller coaster of HCG, the doctor prescribed medication to induce miscarriage. However, even after a week, I did not miscarry. It was Oct 2019, I was 8 weeks pregnant, unable to sustain, unable to miscarry and then it happened. We finished dinner and were ready to go to bed and suddenly I started having excruciating pain in the right side of my abdomen. Unable to bear the pain, my husband rushed me to the emergency where I was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy. My right fallopian tube had ruptured and I had accumulated a lot of blood internally. I was rushed for an emergency laparoscopic surgery to remove the ruptured tube and clean the blood. Fortunately, I had a speedy recovery. This was our first ever experience with ectopic pregnancy.

I was rushed for an emergency laparoscopic surgery to remove the ruptured tube and clean the blood. Fortunately, I had a speedy recovery. This was our first ever experience with ectopic pregnancy. Neither us nor the doctor ever suspected it, even though the HCG level was so erratic. The doctor had also diagnosed increased levels of thyroid. This was such a blunder and we always wonder if the rupture could have been avoided, should we have received better care, should we have done some research, should we have been more alert. On my doctor’s part, not checking for an ectopic pregnancy and not handling it the right way, like using methotrexate, was a big oversight to say the least. The one which could have cost me my life.\n\nMy husband and I tried to learn as much as possible about ectopic pregnancy, cause, symptoms, remedies, all of it. We also came in touch with a specialized ObGyn and an infertility specialist. We were all ready to go for IVF. We were trying to learn all about IVF and then it happened again. Aug 2020, I tested positive again. We have never been any more scared than seeing those 2 lines on the take home test. We immediately rushed to see my ObGyn. Multiple HCG tests were done. HCG levels started from 104, and within a week climbed to 1030. Early ultrasound did not reveal anything, no sack, no internal bleeding, nothing. The doctor said they were not expecting to see anything at the time and is not an indication to worry. The initial HCG level of 104 was worrisome, but once the level reached 1030, the doctor was more comfortable and was expecting it to be a normal pregnancy. This time we were also in touch with a fertility specialist, for a 2nd opinion. Both doctors arrived at the same conclusion, shouldn’t be ectopic. The doctor was aware of my thyroid issue. So they kept a close eye on thyroid levels. She also checked for my progesterone level and found it to be a little low. She prescribed me medication to help increase progesterone. \n\nOne week later, the HCG levels jumped to approximately 8000. We were starting to get a little happy, but were still worried since the location of the implantation was not yet confirmed. Another ultrasound was done and it quickly became the day when all hopes, dreams & aspirations crashed to pieces. Our worst fear had come true. It was an ectopic pregnancy again. I was 7.5 weeks pregnant at the time. However the tube was intact, which gave us some hope and relief. After discussion with the doctor to weigh all options, my husband, I and the doctor decided to use methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. I got methotrexate through an injection. Also, another HCG test was done to get the updated count. It was at approximately 18000+. The doctor quickly realized that the levels were too high for the methotrexate to be effective on time and made the call to perform the laparoscopic surgery to remove the pregnancy. She assured me that she will do her best to preserve the fallopian tube. But she could not. I lost my only hope, I lost my second and only remaining tube.\n\nAt the time of writing my story, I am on the path to recover from the surgery. Meanwhile I am also trying to gather all I can about IVF. Trying to understand if that’s still an option for me. I am scared if my body can still go through the process, after 4 miscarriages and 2 ectopics with surgeries and no fallopian tubes. In all of the hopelessness, in all of the uncertainty, the only thing unchanged is that we want to have a baby. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has had similar experience can share their story with me. It would mean a lot if anyone can help me answer my questions.\n\nA little bit of background, my husband & I are 34 years old. We are both non-smokers, non-drinkers and have never done drugs of any sort. We don’t have any life-style diseases, like blood pressure or diabetes etc, nor do we have any other health issues in general, except for my thyroids for which I take medication. No one in both our families had any infertility issue. Up until the world shut down due to COVID-19, we used to workout at least 3-4 hours per week. We have never had any other sexual partner than each other.\n\nSome of my questions, if anyone can help me answer:\n\n1. If anyone had a similar problem like me, where they lost both fallopian tubes, is it still safe to go for IVF? To put it very bluntly, can IVF for people like me be life threatening since the body has already been through so much?\n2. Again for someone with a similar problem like me, what was the success rate? How many attempts did it take to get pregnant? Was the pregnancy healthy?\n3. In general, does IVF have any long term health effects? Since they inject a lot of hormones, can they cause long term issues?\n4. When speaking to a IVF specialist, what questions should we ask? What information should we try to understand?\n5. This is a location based question. We live in Seattle, WA, USA. Which fertility clinic or which IVF specialist should we go to? There are quite a few around and it would really help to get peoples first hand experience.

My husband and I were so naive in taking the next chapter of our life for granted. Year 2017, 3 years into our marriage, we started trying to get pregnant and very soon I tested positive. But our happiness was short lived, ending with a miscarriage. My husband and I were 31 at the time. As devastating as it was, we found that miscarriage is, unfortunately, a very common occurrence in many pregnancies. We wanted to try again and were happy to get pregnant for the 2nd time. But it ended with a miscarriage again. For the 2nd time, we were heart broken. This went on for 2 more miscarriages, in total 4 miscarriages, until Sep 2019. The cause for these 4 miscarriages is still a mystery. Were they ectopic, was there any genetic issue, we can only guess.</p>\n\n<p>Sep 2019, I tested positive again. By this time, I was in touch with a family practitioner. I went for a blood test to check for HCG count. Unfortunately it was low, around 197. My doctor was doubtful of a successful pregnancy. She did another blood work, with HCG count around 250 and another one after that with HCG count around 200. With such a roller coaster of HCG, the doctor prescribed medication to induce miscarriage. However, even after a week, I did not miscarry. It was Oct 2019, I was 8 weeks pregnant, unable to sustain, unable to miscarry and then it happened. We finished dinner and were ready to go to bed and suddenly I started having excruciating pain in the right side of my abdomen. Unable to bear the pain, my husband rushed me to the emergency where I was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy. My right fallopian tube had ruptured and I had accumulated a lot of blood internally. I was rushed for an emergency laparoscopic surgery to remove the ruptured tube and clean the blood. Fortunately, I had a speedy recovery. This was our first ever experience with ectopic pregnancy. Neither us nor the doctor ever suspected it, even though the HCG level was so erratic. The doctor had also diagnosed increased levels of thyroid. This was such a blunder and we always wonder if the rupture could have been avoided, should we have received better care, should we have done some research, should we have been more alert. On my doctor’s part, not checking for an ectopic pregnancy and not handling it the right way, like using methotrexate, was a big oversight to say the least. The one which could have cost me my life.</p>\n\n<p>My husband and I tried to learn as much as possible about ectopic pregnancy, cause, symptoms, remedies, all of it. We also came in touch with a specialized ObGyn and an infertility specialist. We were all ready to go for IVF. We were trying to learn all about IVF and then it happened again. Aug 2020, I tested positive again. We have never been any more scared than seeing those 2 lines on the take home test. We immediately rushed to see my ObGyn. Multiple HCG tests were done. HCG levels started from 104, and within a week climbed to 1030. Early ultrasound did not reveal anything, no sack, no internal bleeding, nothing. The doctor said they were not expecting to see anything at the time and is not an indication to worry. The initial HCG level of 104 was worrisome, but once the level reached 1030, the doctor was more comfortable and was expecting it to be a normal pregnancy. This time we were also in touch with a fertility specialist, for a 2nd opinion. Both doctors arrived at the same conclusion, shouldn’t be ectopic. The doctor was aware of my thyroid issue. So they kept a close eye on thyroid levels. She also checked for my progesterone level and found it to be a little low. She prescribed me medication to help increase progesterone. </p>\n\n<p>One week later, the HCG levels jumped to approximately 8000. We were starting to get a little happy, but were still worried since the location of the implantation was not yet confirmed. Another ultrasound was done and it quickly became the day when all hopes, dreams &amp; aspirations crashed to pieces. Our worst fear had come true. It was an ectopic pregnancy again. I was 7.5 weeks pregnant at the time. However the tube was intact, which gave us some hope and relief. After discussion with the doctor to weigh all options, my husband, I and the doctor decided to use methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. I got methotrexate through an injection. Also, another HCG test was done to get the updated count. It was at approximately 18000+. The doctor quickly realized that the levels were too high for the methotrexate to be effective on time and made the call to perform the laparoscopic surgery to remove the pregnancy. She assured me that she will do her best to preserve the fallopian tube. But she could not. I lost my only hope, I lost my second and only remaining tube.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing my story, I am on the path to recover from the surgery. Meanwhile I am also trying to gather all I can about IVF. Trying to understand if that’s still an option for me. I am scared if my body can still go through the process, after 4 miscarriages and 2 ectopics with surgeries and no fallopian tubes. In all of the hopelessness, in all of the uncertainty, the only thing unchanged is that we want to have a baby. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has had similar experience can share their story with me. It would mean a lot if anyone can help me answer my questions.</p>\n\n<p>A little bit of background, my husband &amp; I are 34 years old. We are both non-smokers, non-drinkers and have never done drugs of any sort. We don’t have any life-style diseases, like blood pressure or diabetes etc, nor do we have any other health issues in general, except for my thyroids for which I take medication. No one in both our families had any infertility issue. Up until the world shut down due to COVID-19, we used to workout at least 3-4 hours per week. We have never had any other sexual partner than each other.</p>\n\n<p>Some of my questions, if anyone can help me answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If anyone had a similar problem like me, where they lost both fallopian tubes, is it still safe to go for IVF? To put it very bluntly, can IVF for people like me be life threatening since the body has already been through so much?</li>\n<li>Again for someone with a similar problem like me, what was the success rate?

I am going to give you what happened to me not to scare any of you in a similar situation but so that you have information as you start your journey. It was so incredibly hard for me to find. 

I had my FET done 07/31 and my first BETA 10 days later which came back at 34. They brought me in again and it had risen to 71. My doctor immediately through out the word ectopic (which I had never heard before) and of course that’s when my internet search started. I almost wish he had waited to even mention this but looking back it allowed me to get educated. So they called me back for another BETA 4 days later which came back at over 300. Of course my husband and I were excited because it was doubling and optimistic that maybe we just had a slow rising success story. All while this was happening I had a dull cramping on my left side that definitely was not painful but I did notice it. I was just thinking I was on super high alert and noticing everything. My doctor still didn’t like the 360 number and decided to pull me off my progesterone and estrace and I was going to do one last beta to see if my body would ‘take care of it’

This last weekend I started to bleed which I chopped it up to be a result of being pulled off my meds but it started to clot. As it progressed I finally decided to push pass my stubbornness and go to the ER. I had figured since it was doubling in theory it should be high enough at this point to see something and it was. They were able to see the sac and the yolk nestled right in my left Fallopian tube. I was then given 2 options: MTX or surgery. The doctor who I just met in the ER had said my numbers were still low and I was a great candidate for the shot so I opted for it to try and save my tube because at this point that was running through my mind. So my husband and I left the ER Sunday night on pins and needles wondering every moment for the next week whether I was going to rupture and what damage that would cause. My HCG by Thursday was now up to 3800 but doc said it was normal to rise before it fell so I didn’t worry but still remained on edge. Returned for my 7 day draw to find my HCG had only lowered to 3700 which was definitely not the 15% we had hoped for. Doc gave me 2 more options: another dose of MTX or surgery. He was quite honest with me at this point and let me know it was a low chance the methotrexate would actually work if it wasn’t working already. Honestly at this point I was so on edge about my tube rupture I opted this time for the surgery. This entire time I was not in pain and my bleeding had stopped so my case was different then some stories you may read about experiencing pain.

When I woke up from surgery doc finally gave me my first positive set of news since this all happened which was that he saved my tube and it looked great 👍 for the first time in a month I was able to sleep good. 
Before this started I had no idea this could even happen and I was not even in the ‘risk’ category but it did. I am just posting this in hopes that it may help get that second look early or that extra blood draw. If your doctor isn’t listening go to another. It is so important the first couple of weeks because if it does happen to be something we all hope it isn’t you are that much ahead and it could mean potentially saving your fertility. If you wait too long you may not be given any options at all.

2 IVF, 3 transfers over the last year. MFI and a blocked tube. First round sperm count was 1mil, second round after including clomid and pregnyl his count was 10 mil. This last round we ended up with 4 good embryos and they all failed.  

We're taking a break because emotionally, physically and financially we need to. We had a follow up to find out what possibly went wrong and what we could do to increase our odds because our next IVF will be our last shot.

I was kind of surprised when I expressed my pessimism and my doctor said ""I think we'll be fine"". HUH? IF YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT AND THIS IS THE MAGIC COMBO, WHY DIDN'T WE TRY THIS EARLIER?!

I'm 36 years old, decided to pursue egg freezing back in May when I was 35. I decided on this path for a number of reasons - I have always wanted children but unfortunately was with a man for my entire 20s and the relationship ended when I was 33. I'm also a physician who went to medical school late in life and won't be done with training until I'm 38, I didn't feel comfortable having children on my own until then. And had hoped I would meet someone, obviously. My father unfortunately passed away in December and it was a great wish of his that I pursue fertility preservation as he had a colleague who he really admired had two children from frozen eggs and talked about it all the time. I did ask about freezing embryos with donor sperm and my doctor strongly discouraged it because then if I found a partner who wanted his own biological children we couldn't use them.

Anyway - the point is I started this looking for only fertility preservation. Things quickly became complicated - my uterus looked strange on the initial ultrasound, and my right ovary was unable to be visualized. The doctor sent me for an MRI, they said I had an arcuate uterus and that the ovary just sat very high in the pelvic inlet. Doctor OKed me to start stims for a retrieval. I stimmed for 11 days with 300u follistim and two vials of menopur, they retrieved only two eggs (saw 5-7 follicles in left ovary). At that time I was told the right ovary didn't respond at all. Doctor also told me I had diminished ovarian reserve - AMH is 0.867. She suggested I do another cycle with microdose flare protocol. 

So after my period, we confirmed that I had ovulated and I started prepping with estrace 1mg twice a day. Then on CD2 started with 10u lupron twice a day, 225 follistim, 3 vials of menopur. Stimmed for 12 days. Yesterday at morning monitoring my RE was the doctor there and said they are only really seeing one follice on left ovary, which didn't make sense with my estrogen level. Managed to find my right ovary with abdominal ultrasound and there are lots of follicles in there. She doesn't feel comfortable trying to retrieve transabdominally because the ovary is so high that it's near major blood vessels and organs. 

So, cycle is canceled. Doctor says she thinks I should try one more time, at the first protocol, and hope left ovary responds more this time. Said she could refer me to a gyn onc to see if there's anything to be done about the right ovary, but someone would have to surgically move it down which she doesn't think is worth it. Another complication is that despite the MRI they now think my uterus is bicornuate and want to do an HSP at some point. 

I don't really know what to do. I've been paying out of pocket for all of this. I desperately want to have a biological child some day but it just seems like this is not working. I don't know if I should just give up and hope that if I meet someone I might be able to get pregnant naturally? Go through another cycle? Go get another opinion somewhere else?

Long story short, We have gone through 3 egg retrievals (2,1,0), resulting in 3 embryos that all didn't make it past 10 days from transfer. Then we made a hard decision to do an egg donation. After picking our donor, we got 6 eggs and only 1 made it past Blast. Transferred it and also didn't make it past 10 days. So now we have decided to do an embryo donation (which has been hard on us not having our own DNA in our child), but we just want to raise and love any child of ours so we are at ease now with it. However, our embryo donation is a little unique. We have great friends of ours (which I have known the husband for 24 years), that also went through IVF. They were able to get 7 embryos, and after their 2nd attempt was able to give birth to their beautiful baby (they already had one child before). So they have 5 embryos left and consistently asked us that they are willing to donate them to us! They feel 100% about donating their remaining embryos to us as they have their family complete and know how hard we have dealt with infertility.

I am preparing for my second IUI. I took 5mg femara CD 3-7 and on CD11 had sharp pains near my left ovary which were similar to what I had previously experienced around the time of ovulation. 

I went to my clinic for an ultrasound on CD13. At this time I had two follicles on the left side measuring 15 mm and 10 mm, and my lining was \~10 mm. Last cycle on CD13 I had one follicle measuring 17 mm and my lining was \~7 mm (not sure about other follicles). 

Based on my 15 mm follicle result, they scheduled me for IUI on CD17 without additional monitoring. I called today (CD15) and requested a second ultrasound tomorrow to make sure that the 15mm follicle is in fact the leading follicle and that I did not already ovulate.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I went to CZ to do an egg retrieval in November 2019 (no viable embryos) and had another one planned for Feb 2020. That obviously got cancelled. In May, I found out that CZ was allowing foreigners to enter the country under a medical exception (more on that below). I was able to go back in early July for another ER and will hopefully do an FET around November.

**Travel Restrictions and Exceptions**

Things can and do change very quickly. The info I'm giving is what is happening now and what happened in July. Things could be different next week. Always check the Czech Ministry of the Interior's [website](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/coronavirus-information-of-moi.aspx) for the latest information. 

The applicable document is called ""Conditions for entry of persons to the territory of the Czech Republic (valid from DD.MM.YYYY) in accordance with the Ministry of Health Protective Measure. I'm not going to link it here because it can change weekly and can be found at the link above. The medical exception is currently found in section C.4.3 - Urgent emergency situations. Your clinic will provide a letter confirming that you may enter the country because you are seeking medical treatment. 

It is very likely that you will have layovers. You will need to check that country's conditions for entry. Do not rely on the [EU's policy](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-and-transportation-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en#exemptions-from-travel-restrictions) as each member country may adopt their own policies. For example, our layovers were in Germany. They have a [transit exception](https://www.germany.info/us-en/coronavirus/2317268), as do many EU countries, but not an applicable medical exception.

Here's the crappy thing: you can do everything right and still be denied entry. My clinic told me about at least one American who wasn't even allowed on the plane the week before I left on the same airline. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/U6xp48k) an email from the ministry of the interior that fueled my anxiety.

**The Trip**

I brought my dad with me. We both got COVID tests 72 hours before we landed in CZ and got our results 48 hours later. You don't have to do this becaue European countries don't accept American COVID test results. We just wanted to 1) make sure we didn't have COVID before we left and 2) be able to show border agents that we at least care. We each carried a copy of the letter from our clinic, printed copies of the conditions for entry for CZ and our layover country, and our negative COVID tests. Do not expect any officials that you encounter to know all the exceptions to travel restrictions. Be prepared to show/explain the medical exception to a lot of officials along the way. 

We had to show our letter and explain our situation before getting on our international flight from the US, once we got to Germany (make sure your layover is long enough for this), and when we got to CZ. You will be asked if the medical treatment is necessary. The answer is yes! You may be asked if you can get this treatment in your home country. The answer is no!

The US is a ""red zone country."" That means that once you arrive you will need to get a COVID test. You will have to quarantine until the results of your test come back. If you don't have COVID, you can move around freely. the conditions for entry and lots of signs in the airport say that you have to contact a hygiene station when you arrive. My clinic did this for me and arranged for testing, so check in and see what they will do for you and what you need to do yourself. I didn't know that my clinic was contacting the hygiene station so I did as well and it created some confusion.

The morning after our arrival, we took a train to Brno. We wore our masks since we were supposed to be quarantined, but no one else on the train wore one. As of July 1, 2020, masks were no longer required in CZ. We had to quarantine until we could take our test, which took more than 72 hours because we arrived on the weekend of a national holiday. Once we took the tests, our results were back in 24 hours. Masks are not required by law but most hotels and the clinic asked that people wear them inside public areas.

On the way back we took the train to Prague, spent 2 days there, and then flew back to theUS. Once we landed in the US we had to go through customs, where we got our temperatures taken and filled out a questionnaire before going through the regular customs line. It was the longest I have ever spent in a customs line and we almost missed our layover. Make sure to account for that when booking flights! They tell you to quarantine for 2 weeks when you get home, but there was never any follow up. We both faithfully did our two week quarantine. I ended up with a low grade fever so I got tested a week after we got home but it was negative.

We just wanted to 1) make sure we didn&#39;t have COVID before we left and 2) be able to show border agents that we at least care. We each carried a copy of the letter from our clinic, printed copies of the conditions for entry for CZ and our layover country, and our negative COVID tests. Do not expect any officials that you encounter to know all the exceptions to travel restrictions. Be prepared to show/explain the medical exception to a lot of officials along the way. </p>

<p>We had to show our letter and explain our situation before getting on our international flight from the US, once we got to Germany (make sure your layover is long enough for this), and when we got to CZ. You will be asked if the medical treatment is necessary. The answer is yes! You may be asked if you can get this treatment in your home country. The answer is no!</p>

<p>The US is a &quot;red zone country.&quot; That means that once you arrive you will need to get a COVID test. You will have to quarantine until the results of your test come back. If you don&#39;t have COVID, you can move around freely. the conditions for entry and lots of signs in the airport say that you have to contact a hygiene station when you arrive. My clinic did this for me and arranged for testing, so check in and see what they will do for you and what you need to do yourself. I didn&#39;t know that my clinic was contacting the hygiene station so I did as well and it created some confusion.</p>

<p>The morning after our arrival, we took a train to Brno. We wore our masks since we were supposed to be quarantined, but no one else on the train wore one. As of July 1, 2020, masks were no longer required in CZ. We had to quarantine until we could take our test, which took more than 72 hours because we arrived on the weekend of a national holiday. Once we took the tests, our results were back in 24 hours. Masks are not required by law but most hotels and the clinic asked that people wear them inside public areas.</p>

<p>On the way back we took the train to Prague, spent 2 days there, and then flew back to theUS. Once we landed in the US we had to go through customs, where we got our temperatures taken and filled out a questionnaire before going through the regular customs line. It was the longest I have ever spent in a customs line and we almost missed our layover. Make sure to account for that when booking flights! They tell you to quarantine for 2 weeks when you get home, but there was never any follow up. We both faithfully did our two week quarantine. I ended up with a low grade fever so I got tested a week after we got home but it was negative.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>That was a lot! Feel free to ask me any questions about traveling during COVID or IVF in CZ in general!</p>

will try to make this brief... cliff's notes to start:

\- started trying a year ago (I'm now 33, husband 36.)

\-my basic stats: 5'4, 120lbs, never smoked, take every vitamin possible, vegetarian, ovulate tracking (temp, LH), ovulate day 12-13 like clockwork, cycles 25-26 days, no fibroids, cysts, polyps, etc, uterus normal.

\-husband 6'1, 170lb, semen analysis in January had 220mil, 76% super motile, 11% morph

\-pregnant on month 6 of trying (positive test 2 weeks after semen analysis came back)

\-heartbeat at 6w3d, MMC at 8weeks. 3 rounds of misoprostol over a month. 4 followup ultrasounds, told ok to try again, was a ""fluke"", first cycle approved to try was a chemical.

I saw my OBGYN 3 weeks ago because ever since the miscarriage (5 months ago) I've had awful depression and anxiety, crying every day, etc. he said ""You just need to get pregnant again. go to an RE, do an IUI, move on"" and he ordered my bloodwork.

I got a call from my ob's office  saying bloodwork was all ""normal"" no other details.

Had first call with RE yesterday, and he said my AMH was fine (2.2ng/ml) but my FSH of 10.0 was alarming for a 33 year old. He said I could have poor egg quality and that's probably what caused my miscarriage. he recommended IVF with genetic testing.  ( also tested LH 4.3, ESTRADIOL 49)

I spoke to a woman online yesterday who said she had similar numbers and did 8 rounds of IVF with no baby, and no embryos. She also had fibroids and endo, but the borderline FSH she thought was the issue.

I know everyone is different, and there's no crystal ball, but I'm already so depressed and scared. Is IVF with an FSH of 10 totally pointless? I'm so exhausted from heartbreak and having hope.

I've also heard that stress and caffeine can contribute to FSH but I dont know if this is true-- I was coming off a 60 hour work week and it was the day before we had movers come to move 2 hours away to our new house, I took a break from packing to go to the lab for blood draw. I'm not sure if this matters. I did the test on day 4 of my cycle, and ovulated on day 10 this month.

Me and my wife are battling infertility for about three years. It's safe to say that it negatively impacted almost every aspect of out lives - our relationship, friednships, family relations, even work. During this trial I'm trying to be as supportive as possible, but recently I ventured into a pretty dark place and can't seem to get out of it. 

We are the last childless couple in our closest family/friend circle.

At the same time I'm having more and more trouble keeping it together. My first and last thought of the day is something along the lines ""it should be us"" or ""it's unfair"". I should be supporting my wife, and feeling this way - weak looser - is an endless cause of shame.

It probably sounds very selfish, and it probably is. I want to be stronger and somehow control those thoughts to be more supportive and hopeful. Is there someone that managed to overcome this state? How did you do it?

Quick backstory; I by chance found out earlier this summer after a routine gynecologist checkup that my ovarian reserve is low for my age (low AMH/high FSH).  Devastated - 36, newly single and believing I still had plenty time for children- I threw myself around and decided to freeze my eggs.  Found Southern California Reproductive Clinic online (after a quick Reddit search).

So:

Did a consult first via phone two weeks ago (because of Covid), the Dr. seemed ok, not great but phone consults with strangers are always weird.  He seemed competent and took his time to talk with me so I decided to go ahead with the process with them.  Next days were a little back and forth with the financing department, communication wasn't great and I felt I had lots of questions regards the process but figured it would be answered during my first visit.  They sent me paperwork (not a welcome packet or info) to fill out credit card info and I told them on the phone I was a little uncomfortable just giving credit card info for $7k+ without having seen a single face but nobody seemed to take the hint and walk me through things.

Today was first day at clinic (day 3 of period) and I went in for a follicle count.  I knew the Dr. wasn't going to be there because it was very early morning.  I check in; after 20mins a technician comes and says maybe two sentences during my whole ultrasound.  I don't even remember if she said hi but she definitely wasn't very friendly.  She doesn't tell me my follicle count or anything else than 'your ovaries look fine, they'll call you with results' and then exits.  I sit back wondering if that was it and almost start to cry.  I put my clothes back on and as I step out of the room- not knowing where I'm supposed to go or if I'm done- someone else comes and gets me to take some blood work.  I try to ask what it is for and she says she has to check.  Then the front desk walks up and says they need my drivers license.  I give it to them and when getting it back I ask do you need anything else from me?  Like do I fill out any paperwork?  Talk to anyone?  (Sign over $7k?)  She checks her system and says 'oh yes, that'll be five hundred and fifty dollars please'.

Ten minutes later I'm in my car bawling.  I don't know what I was expecting I guess, but at least some answers.  It was such an anti climax.  I had no idea how the ultrasound had gone.  Was she silent because what she saw was bad?  Did I not have any follicles at all?  I had thought today was 'start day' of what is kindof a big fucking deal; about to begin a ton of hormones and spend thousands of dollars and go through a big process all on my own, not to mention the whole learning about my declining fertility and trying to salvage a chance at having a family-thing emotionally.  But I sit in my car being none the wiser, wondering if this is something I really want to do.  I decide to wait and see what the doctor says when he calls.    


When he does call I am honest and tell him that I didn't have a good start to the day and how my experience this morning was.  When I mentioned the technician not saying anything to me he says 'they're not supposed to, that's my job'.  He doesn't say he's sorry or pretend to have empathy that I found the experience confusing or overwhelming and just matter of factly continues with the results.  He isn't rude or unfriendly but I get the impression he expects me to know a lot of the things on my own.  He keeps referring to the webpage and says I should 'read the info there to get familiar with stuff'.    


He goes over the schedule for the process and says we'll start by putting you on birth control for 10 days and then you'll schedule an appointment here.  I ask him if I can actually meet him then and he says that if I want to, we can 'try and make that happen, but you'll have to wear a mask'.  Like wtf, we already do that everywhere?  Oh and when explaining the injections he says 'it's just like botox' - I try to be funny and say I know this is Beverly Hills but I don't actually know how Botox works'.  He replies 'well you should'.  I'm assuming he was being funny back but to be honest I don't know. 

It ends with him transferring me to the person in his clinical team to do the scheduling, she's very friendly but when I ask her what birth control I am put on she says I can use my own.  The Dr. didn't mention this and since none of them know which brand I have at home I ask her if that doesn't matter?  She says no. Then I ask what's in the one she can prescribe me and she says estrogen.  I think mine is a combination pill that contains more than one active ingredient and when I say this she says she's never heard of my brand.  Well, but you were just about to have me start my own so if I hadn't asked does that mean I would have been taking the wrong thing?  Just questions, questions, questions... 

I don't want to waste any time and now that I'm literally about to start a cycle, going to other clinics and starting over feels like time that I don't have.  But it's an exorbitant amount of money (that I don't have either, everything will be a loan) to be spending on a process that's already pretty mentally taxing and this team is not making me feel any good about any of it. 

Is this normal?  Am I just expecting too much hand holding through the process?

230,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi friends,

I went into an IVF clinic in December of last year to look into freezing my eggs. My company pays for it, so I thought ""why not?"". To my shock, I found that I had 0.33 AMH at 26yo, and only 5 AFC. Upon doing a karyotype, I learned that I have a Turner Syndrome variant and have a partial deletion in all of second X chromosomes. Due to it being a small deletion (q25-q28), I still have most of the 2nd X, as well as no phenotypes associated with Turner's - so neither my parents nor my doctors over the years had any idea. I'm certainly fortunate not to have the many congenital issues like heart, kidney, and thyroid malfunctions that come along with the condition (we ran all the tests).  


However, my ovaries were pretty badly affected by the genetic condition. My AMH has now decreased to 0.03 and AFC is 1. My estradiol had been measuring at below 5 for months, until I couldn't take the hot flashes and insomnia anymore. My doctor confirmed that I'm perimenopausal (if not fully menopausal, he couldn't be sure). I started birth control on Friday to alleviate the symptoms, which effectively ends my egg retrieval treatments as even if there was a chance I'd ovulate again, it wouldn't happen due to the birth control. 

&#x200B;

I was able to freeze two eggs before my ovulation stopped, so I'm cognizant that chances are I'll need donor eggs. I'm at peace with that, and so is my partner. I tried six different stim protocols and four of them completely failed (no ovulation), whereas two protocols yielded one mature egg each.   


However, I feel super lonely in going through menopause in my mid-20s. It's a very isolating experience that no one can relate to. My friends aren't even thinking of having kids, let alone dealing with infertility and/or menopause.  


Is anyone else here going through something similar, or does anyone have words of comfort to share?  

&#x200B;

It was as low as 6.5 million. He had an earlier one done a few months ago at an outside lab (not a fertility clinic) where his count was better (around 22 million). I'm struggling to understand a bit what could be causing his low sperm count and hoping to hear from others about their experience.

He's 35 years old, healthy with no medical issues or prior medical issues. Rarely drinks, doesn't do drugs or smokes. Maybe drinks 1 cup of coffee a day. He works out regularly (a little less during the pandemic). He gained a bit of weight recently but nothing crazy. Most people looking at him would say he looks fit.

He used to before put his laptop by his groin when we first started trying, I've asked him to stop and he has been a lot better with it and he also likes his coke zero. 

So really, the only two main factors I can think of are maybe stress and the coke zero? Could these two really cause such a low sperm count in an otherwise healthy man?

Im (26f) currently one year into going to my fertility clinic. I have one right blocked tube, one left Polycystic Ovary, a polyp and possible endometriosis (my doctor only wants to do a laparoscopy after we take care of other stuff first). 

I have a hysteroscopy to remove the polyp booked for September 25th. My doctor said I can book my tubal recanalization after we get the polyp removed. He explained the procedure for the recanalization to me and I understand what happens but I can't seem to find much more information other than what they do during the procedure. 

I am just curious what the recovery is like and if any ladies experienced pain with blocked tubes? If you had the procedure done and had pain, do you experience pain still? Have you had to go for a second recanalization? 

I feel quite nervous for that procedure over the polyp removal because there seems to be so much more information and experiences with it than the tubal recanalization.

I hope it's ok that I post here... I'm very sorry if it's not. I'm just needing a place to vent.

Spouse and I finally got to a place in our lives where we were ready to start trying for a baby - I got to a healthy weight, we got settled into a house, made an appointment for genetic testing... Then I get diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called scleroderma. After tons of tests and doctors with still more to come, there is pretty good evidence that I have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 

While I know they mean well, every provider I spoke with just this past Friday spent an inordinate amount of time stressing that I absolutely should not get pregnant unless they can confirm I don't have PAH. All of them have also spent a ton of time trying to convince me that I need a better birth control option than just condoms and that just kind of twisted the knife even more. 

I may have read the journal article wrong but I think 89% of pregnancies with PAH usually result in the mother's death sometime in the third trimester or within a month of having a baby due to heart failure or lung embolisms.

I go back in September for a heart cath to confirm if I have PAH, but right now I am at a loss and I don't know where to turn because I don't have high hopes that I don't have PAH from what my doctors told me. I think I cried for about 4 hours on Friday until I didn't have anymore tears. Even then I dry-cried. I'm still crying a lot randomly through the day and I don't really have a family that understands why I can't just buck up about it, as they have all had multiple children... but they've respected that I need some space. My spouse has been amazing though and has really come through when I just need to cry on him or tell him the dark things running through my head. He also wasn't upset when I got a speeding ticket during a drive to help take my mind off things.

It all just sucks.

Me and my wife are just hitting our 1 year mark in trying to get pregnant and I'm looking for some help and information from others who have experienced this process. As far as background info, I'm 29 and my wife is nearly 28. My wife has been on birth control for at least 10 years prior to this. My wife also has 2x cervixes, but only one uterus. We've done ultrasounds to check into that and aren't expecting complications.

We are going to start the process as far as trying to figure out what is going on and if we're infertile. Naturally, my wife doesn't want to wait any longer ;). What kinds of steps would you recommend starting with? From what I've read, it seems like starting with blood tests for both of us and a semen analysis for me would be a good start. And not to be insensitive, but I'm trying to stay logical and figure this out without spending a fortune on different tests that may or may not be necessary. Does anyone have any experience with this or know general prices? My insurance doesn't appear to cover much when it comes to infertility tests.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all of your feedback I really appreciate it as researching this with articles has been kinda difficult to get good answers.

261,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello Everyone, this is my 1st time ever posting so hopefully this is allowed.

Quick stats: I’m currently 38, TTC since 2016. 2 mc in 1st trimester, 1 failed IUI, 2 rounds of ER (1st round was traumatizing bc we only had 1 embryo and I wasn’t prepared for that), 2nd round ER had 5 embryos &amp; completed 3 ET- all fails. I have 2 more left (planning to transfer both for our last round). To make things complicated we did IVF in Prague and due to covid I don’t know when I can go back for my last ET (I’m from the US). I have unexplained infertility, I’m healthy, exercise regularly and try to eat healthy. 

My question: Everyone in this group knows IVF is all so traumatic and can be so brutal on the body. Has anyone experienced body trauma due to all the poking, prodding, needles etc?  I’m not even sure I can articulate exactly what I mean. But here’s some examples:

I went to a dental appt and they did a routine teeth cleaning and I cried while getting my teeth cleaned. Something about the hygienist poking my gums triggered my body to respond negatively (I was caught off guard and couldn’t stop myself from crying). 

I had to get a biopsy of my breast to screen for breast cancer and cried during my appt. Same thing- the digging into my breast to get the sample make me weep. 

I had my 2nd saline sono last week and cried during my appt and after I sobbed in the car. All of these appt were uncomfortable and hurt but not so much that I would cry normally. Normally meaning I never cried in the past when having a medical appointment. 

 (Like who cries during a teeth cleaning? Lol) 

I’m clearly holding trauma in my body and I don’t know how to exercise them out. I’ve been to therapy in the past with someone who specializes in grief and infertility and it helped but not with the body trauma. I meditate, I exercise, do yoga but I don’t know how to deal with the overwhelmingness of routine medical appointments. It always catches me off guard. 

My friend recommended “the body keeps score”.

Any other people have recommendations? Is this something other people have experienced? I don’t see a lot of conversation about it (if so please point me in the right direction). 

Much appreciated.

Update: Thank you to everyone who posted. It’s good to know I’m not alone. I think it’s time to go back to therapy and see if I can work through the core of my grief.

<p>Any other people have recommendations? Is this something other people have experienced? I don’t see a lot of conversation about it (if so please point me in the right direction). </p>

<p>Much appreciated.</p>

<p>Update: Thank you to everyone who posted. It’s good to know I’m not alone. I think it’s time to go back to therapy and see if I can work through the core of my grief. Deep thanks to all the ladies in this struggle. 🙏🏾</p>

I’m a little frustrated as I’ve been with my clinic for almost a year now, and am just learning that some doctors at other clinics are actually accessible by email and respond by email. At the clinic I go to, all questions go through the nurses, they don’t always answer emails, are extremely difficult to reach by phone, and when I asked to have a wtf call with my RE after a failed transfer, it didn’t even end up on the calendar and so my RE was confused when I finally called in (I was also surprised they didn’t proactively schedule the call with me). I know a lot of the NYC clinics also have a factory feel, but have also read that, depending on which RE you are with, some women at the “factories” still often see their own REs, they are accessible and are the ones doing their procedures...so would love to get some names if anyone is willing to share.

I am at the point where I’m thinking about switching, but we still have embryos at our current clinic, which makes it harder, but want to be prepared by doing more research.

After reading through this wonderful sub and learning about all of the different procedures, lab tests, etc that others have had, I am worried my RE has not done enough evaluation. Am I overthinking it??

We have a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and are both relatively healthy. I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism that has been controlled for >1 year. 

In terms of work-up, we've had:  
1. Semen analysis - clinic said it was the ""best"" in terms of numbers their clinic has ever had. I will have to request the actual reports since I never remember the numbers after we leave the clinic. I'd like to compare his numbers to the guide to understanding semen analyses post.   
2. AMH level of 10, which the RE told me was a good sign  
3. HSG, which was quite a horrible experience, unfortunately. My RE had a very challenging time inserting the catheter and getting a good seal. So much cramping and sharp pains. I think they used about a liter of contrast and the whole thing took over 30 minutes. In any case, the report was ""Uterus is significantly retroverted. The endometrial cavity is normal. Left fallopian tube is normal and there is eventual spill.  Right fallopian tube is normal however there is no spill appreciated during the examination is may be related to inability to perform enough seal and pressure.""  
4. MMR/Rubella titers - immune

And that's it.   
After this work-up, we moved straight to clomid plus IUI.  
1. Cycle 1: Clomid 50mg CD 3-7. US CD 10 which showed 4 follicles about 12-13 mm, US CD 12 showed three that were around 16 mm. We did estradiol levels and LH levels that day and were told I had not ovulated yet. My OPKs did not turn positive so trigger shot (ovidrel) CD15 and single IUI 36 hours later. No repeat ultrasound on day of IUI. Sperm count was good.   
2. Cycle 2: Clomid 50mg CD3-7. US CD 12 with one follicle 18mm. No labs done this time. Ovidrel on CD 15 and single IUI 36 hour later. Sperm count good this day as well. At my request, I started progesterone 100mg daily vaginally two days after IUI. My clinic was sort of wishy washy on whether or not they would actually recommend progesterone, seemed more like they were just appeasing me.   
3. Now on cycle 3. After discussion with my RE, she somewhat hesitantly agreed to increase my clomid to 100mg daily. My lining has looked fine during the previous two cycles. I'm day 5/5 of this course of clomid and have had some hot flashes, but nothing too bad.

As I said before, I'm just worried we have not done enough evaluation. My RE said there is no other evaluation she would recommend at this time. I mentioned hysteroscopy and she said there wasn't enough evidence to suggest that this would be helpful. I also asked about injections vs oral medication prior to IUI, and she was very much against injectables for me (due to cost and increased risk of multiples). I feel helpless through so much of this journey. Thank goodness for my spouse who has been wonderful through this all!!

We live in a medium sized city but the only other fertility clinic in town has horrible reviews. Our insurance doesn't cover anything to do with infertility so we are paying all out of pocket as well. 

I actually really like our RE, she's very nice and has actually given me her number and said I can reach out to her with any questions. I just worry we aren't doing enough evaluation- though I'm sure most couples with unexplained infertility feel like that at times. 

Any advice, thoughts, words of encouragement would be appreciated.

I (34F) have been TTC for two years. I got pregnant once without intervention \[edited\], and once through IUI. Both ended in miscarriages. This week I finally got a diagnosis of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). Essentially, chronic dieting and overexercise has messed up my brain so it doesn't tell my body to develop eggs or ovulate properly.

On the one hand, it's a relief to finally have a diagnosis. On the other hand, I'm furious because this is literally the first thing I asked my RE about 18 months ago. At that point I was exercising 1-2 hours a day and had been doing the keto diet for several years. My RE basically said it wasn't possible for me to have FHA because I had a normal BMI. He said it was likely PCOS, even though I didn't have any of the classic characteristics.

Because I thought I had PCOS, I doubled down on a super strict diet and exercise. This was the worst thing I could have done. I was doing fertility treatments but they weren't working well, and when I did manage to conceive I had a miscarriage due to a chromosomal abnormality.

Last week I finally went to a new RE who actually looked at my entire medical history, and he thinks I have FHA. This definitely seems to match my symptoms more, and was what I already suspected after only a few months of TTC. Treatment is eat more, exercise less, and relax.

I can't believe for the last two years I've been making myself crazy trying to improve my fertility and have been doing the exact opposite. I'm incredibly angry at my first RE, and even more so at myself. I should have trusted my instincts more and pushed for a second opinion sooner.

At that point I was exercising 1-2 hours a day and had been doing the keto diet for several years. My RE basically said it wasn&#39;t possible for me to have FHA because I had a normal BMI. He said it was likely PCOS, even though I didn&#39;t have any of the classic characteristics.</p>

<p>Because I thought I had PCOS, I doubled down on a super strict diet and exercise. This was the worst thing I could have done. I was doing fertility treatments but they weren&#39;t working well, and when I did manage to conceive I had a miscarriage due to a chromosomal abnormality.</p>

<p>Last week I finally went to a new RE who actually looked at my entire medical history, and he thinks I have FHA. This definitely seems to match my symptoms more, and was what I already suspected after only a few months of TTC. Treatment is eat more, exercise less, and relax.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe for the last two years I&#39;ve been making myself crazy trying to improve my fertility and have been doing the exact opposite. I&#39;m incredibly angry at my first RE, and even more so at myself. I should have trusted my instincts more and pushed for a second opinion sooner. It&#39;s ridiculous that it is so hard to get any kind of diagnosis or answers with fertility.</p>

My RE does not recommend ICSI for a first attempt for someone with unexplained infertility, but does recommend it in the case of MFI, citing for example this recent ASRM practice committee opinion: https://www.asrm.org/globalassets/asrm/asrm-content/news-and-publications/practice-guidelines/for-non-members/intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection_icsi_for_non-male_factor.pdf

I’m trying to better understand the difference in these two recommendations. For example, I’m not sure if the low volume/motility numbers on the day of retrieval would indicate potential MFI, despite normal sperm stats from an SA and 4 IUIs.

We have been TTC since January 2020. That is when I truly began to track my cycles, ovulation, waking temps although we were pretty ""loose"" about it as of late last year. My husband has two autoimmune diseases (Hashimotos and Alopecia) so we decided we would have a semen analysis done after TTC for six months. My OBGYN agreed.

We got the results back and were told by my OBGYN that he has severe ogliospermia. OBGYN didn't get into numbers, but said IUI would be promising. Obviously a relief! We had our phone appt with the RE yesterday and she said that wasn't true. Based on his numbers and not knowing anything about me, IVF is going to be our best option. I do ovulate and get a period monthly, but you never know what could be going on that I don't see :\\ We are going to begin a whole IVF work up - bloodwork, testing, he will re-test his sperm, and meet with a urologist that specializes in male infertility.

Trying to be hopeful, but find it hard. Many of my friends are pregnant and none have struggled at all. All have become pregnant within a few months of TTC. I am happy for them, but sad for me. I have that feeling of being on the verge of tears, but not actually being able to cry.

I hope this time allows my husband and I to lean on each other more and better our communication, but the stress of the testing and unknowns hasn't been easy on our relationship. Not to mention, the pressure of work, the pandemic, and normal daily woes.

I am new here. My husband (32m) and I (30f) have been together for almost 11 years. We have been TTC since January 2020. That is when I truly began to track my cycles, ovulation, waking temps although we were pretty &quot;loose&quot; about it as of late last year. My husband has two autoimmune diseases (Hashimotos and Alopecia) so we decided we would have a semen analysis done after TTC for six months. My OBGYN agreed.</p>

<p>We got the results back and were told by my OBGYN that he has severe ogliospermia. OBGYN didn&#39;t get into numbers, but said IUI would be promising. Obviously a relief! We had our phone appt with the RE yesterday and she said that wasn&#39;t true. Based on his numbers and not knowing anything about me, IVF is going to be our best option. I do ovulate and get a period monthly, but you never know what could be going on that I don&#39;t see :\ We are going to begin a whole IVF work up - bloodwork, testing, he will re-test his sperm, and meet with a urologist that specializes in male infertility.</p>

<p>Trying to be hopeful, but find it hard. Many of my friends are pregnant and none have struggled at all. All have become pregnant within a few months of TTC. I am happy for them, but sad for me. I have that feeling of being on the verge of tears, but not actually being able to cry.</p>

<p>I hope this time allows my husband and I to lean on each other more and better our communication, but the stress of the testing and unknowns hasn&#39;t been easy on our relationship. Not to mention, the pressure of work, the pandemic, and normal daily woes.</p>

<p>I know I am not alone, but I feel that way. Really hoping for a positive outcome! Thanks for reading &lt;3</p>

296,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone. I was wondering if anyone else had similar experience or any insight on this issue.

&#x200B;

Here's our situation:

We've been trying for 3 years, and have been getting help for nearly 2 years now. I am now 35F and my partner is 33M. I had normal hormone levels and a good ovarian reserve, and my partner has severe OATS (Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia - low sperm count, bad motility, and abnormal shapes). We have done 4 IVF cycles and all have failed because they have failed to produce a blastocyst. My clinic wants to do day 5/6 transfers only, and the embryos always arrest before they reach the blastocyst phase. All of our cycles have been done with IMSI (ICSI but with higher magnification of the sperm). My partner has attempted to do a DNA fragmentation test more than once but they were unable to test him due to insufficient samples. After our failed 3rd cycle, we were tested for MTHFR (which we both have) and have been on folate. 

Needless to say, we haven't done any transfers except once with 2 day 3 embryos on our 2nd cycle. Our doctor really wanted to do a transfer for us but that failed. The embryos were grade C quality as they have been for most of our cycles - grade C or D. 

This past cycle, I started taking vitamin supplements including coQ10 and we retrieved more oocytes than in past cycles (a total of 12 versus a max of 8 in the past). We got 8 embryos instead of our usual 5 or so. We had quite a bit of hope since we were told on day 2 (day 3 was a Sunday and the clinic was told) that we had one grade A, one grade B, and the other 6 were grade C embryos. Unfortunately, they all arrested before we could do a blastocyst transfer.

Since failed cycle #3 and especially after this past failed cycle, our doctor has been pushing us to use donor gametes, and namely donor eggs. She is pointing to my eggs as the culprit and dismisses the idea of donor sperm. Obviously there are no tests to see if egg quality is good or bad, but does this seem normal to you? I mean I am getting older and am now 35.5, but still... If it is the egg quality that is holding us back, I will consider donor eggs, but the thing I don't get is that my partner has severe male factor infertility. This is a fact. Instead of automatically pointing to the eggs, why wouldn't it make sense to do an IVF cycle with donor sperm instead? 

I am fortunate to live in a country where the cost of IVF is mostly covered, so money is not an issue for us. I would of course love to become a parent ASAP and it's true that IVF with my eggs could fail again, which would set us back time-wise. However, if we use donor eggs anyway, we no longer will be 'racing against the clock' so to speak. 

We are actually looking into going abroad for better quality IVF and potentially for donor eggs (the waitlist is too high where we live) so we'll see what our new team says, but I was wondering if anyone else had had a similar experience with severe male factor infertility, failed IVF, and a clinic that pushed for donor eggs vs donor sperm.

Semen Analysis (SA) is an important diagnostic test that evaluates certain characteristics of semen and the sperm contained therein.   


Some questions to consider:

* When did you and/or your partner decide to pursue SA testing?
* What parameters were included in your testing?
* Provide a brief interpretation of results, if applicable. 
* What course of ART (TI, IUI, IVF, etc.) was recommended?
* Were you and/or your partner prescribed any medication, treatment, or surgery to treat sperm quantity or quality issues?

I really needed extra support tonight, but he’s gone at his daughter’s practice. We haven’t told anyone about what we’re going through, so I don’t have anyone to talk to. I’ve just been home alone sobbing and punching pillows all evening. </p>

<p>I struggle with feeling resentful over the fact that my husband was able to give another woman a child without even trying, and he can’t give me one. I am resentful that he is gone all night at said child’s practice while I am home mourning over the thought that I may never have children. Am I being irrational? Am I being selfish?</p>

I explained these symptoms to my Obgyn and he believes it is Endometriosis and the surgery will help me become fertile as we have been trying for over a year.

I was on birth control from 18 until 29 (stopped in 2017). I always thought I just had bad cramps the first 2 days of my period but that’s it. My husband I started trying to conceive early last year. Then in Nov I bloated up (like 5 lbs just in my abdomen) a week before my period With constant cramps and had spotting 4 days before my period and a heavy period. Same thing happened in December. I thought this was a chemical pregnancy but my dr believes it is Endo.

We took a break from trying to get pregnant after Dec and I noticed my period cramps got worse the first 2 days. It was close to being debilitating but I was able to push through and work.

Now we tried again this month and the same thing happened but worse. I bloated up a week before my period with horrible cramps that lasted 3 days and kept me up at night. Then I spotted before my period and had 6 hours of intense nausea that I thought I was pregnant. The next day I started my period and I had the worst right ovary pain on top of cramps. I ended up going to the ER that night but they couldn’t find anything on the ultra sound. The ovary pain has gone down a lot but hits me occasionally even though my period is over.

I recently went to a fertility clinic after my husband and I were trying for awhile. About a month ago I got the diagnosis of ""significant endometriosis"" with 2 endometriomas on my left ovary (both 8cm) and 2  on my right (one 8cm, one 2cm). I was pretty caught off guard when I heard this. The first 2 days of my period I have fairly significant cramps, but it's been like this since the very beginning (age 13) and was told it wasn't endo and to take naproxen. 
I was like a deer in the headlights when my doctor told me about these endometiomas. He recommended 3 IUI's then either surgery or IVF. I didn't ask any questions because I didn't know what to say. I'm in the middle of my first IUI cycle currently. My clinics ""rules"" are that I can't have an appointment with my doctor unless I finish my 3 IUI's or I decide to no do anymore IUI's, but can't talk to him during active treatment unless it's urgent. This really bothered me! 
I've since been researching and googling (non stop, which is causing me anxiety), and I now have a referral to one of the best clinics in the area. Where I live we can also have 1 government funded IVF cycle (and this clinic has no wait time because they are a big fancy downtown clinic that gets the most funding). 
I'm looking for advice for what the best questions would be for this doctor? I want to be as prepared as I can for my consultation and not have a repeat deer in the headlights reaction I had last time. 
I've also read that this doctor doesn't usually do Lupron for endo. Does anyone have opinions on that? I've read that it increases success with FET.

On August 1st I tested my first positive test and on the same night I experienced some spotting/bleeding, not the normal amount I get when I get my period. On August 2nd I woke up and took a clear blue which showed positive again, so because of the bleeding I went to the hospital where they performed an ultrasound. They said that my tests from home were definitely positive and that it may be too early to see anything on ultrasound. They suggested I get a blood test from my OBGYN. The next morning I took another test and there was no line. I was also no longer spotting. When I went to the OBGYN they said that there was hcg in my system but not enough to determine a definitive positive. They also suggested that I may have miscarried or that I was having a cryptic pregnancy. Another possibility is ectopic. There has been no further bleeding and It has been 50 days since the end of my last period. Mind you when I took my tests I took them with the first pee of the day for the two positives. One was a first response and one was a clear blue. I am NOTICEABLY more fatigued and I have severe daily dizziness as well as noticeable nausea which none of those things are normal to me at any point in my cycle. I’ve felt extremely dehydrated prior to testing positive.  On top of the doctors not really having a definitive answer for me my cousin went through a similar experience when she first got pregnant with her daughter now and the women on my moms side of the family have experienced odd pregnancies yet still had a completely healthy baby. With my cousins case it was eerily similar to mine where she suspected she was pregnant after her period was a few days late and her and her fiancé at the time had unprotected sex two weeks prior. She took her first test using her first pee of the day and got a positive than she took another the next day and got a positive yet she still bled and experienced symptoms of her period. She went to the hospital the day after her second positive and they told her there was no way she was pregnant and gave her a negative blood result. My cousin had a child prior to her daughter and she felt as though the positives she got were accurate and that something was off. She went back the next month for another blood test and they told her she was absolutely negative. By 2 and a half months she scheduled an appointment with her OBGYN where they confirmed she was 2 and a half months pregnant. They missed her being pregnant for two months and told her with her bleeding and the hcg in her blood there was no way yet she was the entire time. She now has a beautiful daughter who is 2 years old from that pregnancy. Can anyone shed any light on this phenomenon or what I may be experiencing as well as why she experienced that?!
