Subsequent scans of that cycle showed a dominant follicle that reached the correct size at the correct time, but.... It didn't rupture when they thought it would. IIRC it ruptured 4 days after it reached the size at which it would have been expected to rupture. The techs commented on this as if it were unusual.

So I had my second laparoscopy on Monday and the results of my surgery were something of a mixed bag - some things I expected and others I didn't. But we have a bit more of our path forward 😊 

They were looking for endometriosis (due to the level of pain I get throughout the month and particularly during my period) and more importantly to me checking if my tubes were open. I have a long history of recurrent pelvis infections and a previous lap in 2011 showed damage from infections but no endo.

The dye test showed both tubes don't look great and although not totally blocked they were ""sluggish"" which means they're not very open either! They also found some evidence of endo in the form of adhesions around my right ovary/tube (makes sense - this is where I get most of the pain) and my bowel but this could also be damage from previous infections over the years as both present almost the same.

Soooo it looks like we have a few factors working against us getting pregnant and they're now moving us towards IVF. We have our follow up with the consultant next month and before then I need to have an AMH blood test. The fertility nurse explained this would tell them how successful IVF is likely to be as well as helping them work out what doses would be needed. If the results of the AMH test aren't ideal then they will want to do ANOTHER lap to get rid of some of the endo first.

20,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"When I was told I was moving on to IVM I searched forums / blogs for some personal experiences and really struggled to find anything. So, I thought I'd post this for anyone in the same boat now or in the future.

Bit of background on me, I am 32, have PCOS with a very, very high AMH (308 using Aus figures, 43.2 in US terms). I was diagnosed at 19, very rarely get my period (1-2 times per year) and have never had a good time on any sort or hormonal birth control. I was referred to a fertility clinic as soon as we wanted to try, no need to TTC 'naturally' for a year first. We have no male factor issues.

We have done OI using clomid (I didn't respond at all) and OI using Gonal F. Due to my AMH I am a slow responder and trigger days have ranged from CD68 down to 37. My Gonal F dose at trigger was 100. We are now starting IVM.

IVM is in vitro maturation. Unlike IVF, eggs are collected while still immature (although within a specific range of immaturity) then matured in the lab. From that point the process is just like IVF, although ICSI is standard for IVM. IVM is recommended for those with PCOS who are at very high risk of OHSS with IVF. Only say 20 or so clinics around the world offer it, and 3 are the real pioneers / experts. By pure dumb luck, one of those three is where I live. IVM is also used for patients with a history of oestrogen sensitive cancers, although success rates are lower if you are not polycystic with a high antral follicle count.

At my clinic the costs of IVM is comparable to IVF with ICSI. Meds are cheaper due there being less of them, and this would be significant if you live somewhere where the costs of meds is high.

IVM aims for at least 20 eggs collected because on average, only 65% will mature successfully. From there, an average 70% will fertilise, then 70% of that is expected to make it to day 5. Of course this varies person to person. IVM uses less drugs, and with no trigger there is basically no risk of OHSS. Eggs are extracted from within the follicle, so this process takes a little longer than an IVF retrieval.

My plan at the moment is as follows:

Day 2 - bloods and twanding scan with antral follicle count.
Day 3 - commence injections. Gonal F only, staring at 150. I am also on metformin and folic acid.
Day 6 - bloods and twanding scan. Further instructions given on this day.

Generally retrieval will be on day 9 or 10, however, I have never been a typical patient so who knows. Two days prior they will take 10ml of blood from me to use to make the solution that will mature the eggs. Hormones will also be used in the solution.

My husband will provide his sample the day after retrieval for the ICSI procedure.

We will get a call on that same day to give us our maturation numbers. From there the process follows standard IVF hunger games, and then freeze all.

Quick background--two failed transfers with PGS normal embryos. Slight endo confirmed and removed in a lap in April 2018  (performed for other reasons). First ERA came back pre-receptive with a recommendation of 130 hours.

In the middle of my next FET cycle after receiving that result, I decided that before transferring another embryo, I would instead do a month of Depot Lupron to try and quiet the effects that endo may be having on my transfers. I'm about a week into that month right now.

I didn't want to waste another cycle, so I decided to confirm the ERA result and do another biopsy at the recommended 130 hours. Well...I got my results back and they're pre-receptive...AGAIN...ugh. Now Igenomix is recommending 154 hours of progesterone, which I've never seen before.

Things to consider-
I’m on a pregnancy guarantee program, in which they guarantee 1 pregnancy to 22 weeks (or 75% money back). And they will supply max 3 egg donors (min 5 eggs each).  BUT I must have used all the embryos in an 18mth period.  Because of the above mentioned, I am already 4 months down.
We can’t really afford for me to keep going back for the full number of times anyway ($2500 for my flight alone, plus accommodation/meals).</p>

<p>Should I have a transfer this month??</p>

tl;dr normal testing but crap response to 2 different IVF protocols; what could I push for?

Unexplained infertility, here. I will post all the details/results of tests below. We are taking a year off from treatments due to work/school obligations, so I am really taking the time to dive into our 'unexplained infertility.' I am curious what your thoughts are about our situation! I know you aren't REs, (or maybe you are,) but Hive Mind solves problems! Or at least gives me some rabbit holes to climb into.

Started trying in October 2016. As of this cycle (August 2019) we have been trying for 41 cycles. 

October 2016-December 2018, cycles were averaging \~25 days. Spot on CD 24, like clockwork, then have a 3-4 day period. I tried to track BBT, but worked shift work and never could get the hang of it. Some cycles I got LH surges, some cycles I did not. Was tested for PCOS and had an ultrasound in February 2018 by an OBGYN because I wasn't sure I was ovulating. No PCOS. 

January 2019- met with an RE. Learned I would have insurance coverage until the end of May 2019 for infertility. Based on that, we opted to just jump into IVF. HSG is all clear. Day 3 labs: TSH 5.68. Started levothyroxin 50 mcg/day. AMH 2.16, FSH 7.8, AFC 17 (right ovary is a slacker, apparently.) Prolactin 23 ng/mL, Estradiol 43 pg/mL. We decide to wait a cycle to let my TSH level out before IVF. Husband's SA is great, but no DNA frag testing done. 

March 2019- Start birth control to suppress ovaries

April 2019- Stimmed for retrieval 1. 225 iu Gonal F. Triggered at 9 days, I think. Morning of trigger, LH was 0.9, Estradiol was 1156 pg/mL, progesterone 0.3. AFC was around 10. 12 retrieved. 9 mature. 8 fertilized normally, the 9th fertilized a day later. My lab doesn't do day 3 blasts or check them again until day 5. On day 5, we had 3 mature. Day 6, a 4th matured. All are fair/poor qualities, but I wasn't given grades. Fresh transfer of 2 embryos results in a failed cycle.  (Right ovary still a slacker.) 

May 2019- Prep for FET. Lining is beautiful. Transfer our other 2 embryos. Day of, progesterone is 16, estradiol is 271. 5dp5dt I took a test but learned I was having a CP on Mothers Day. Unsure if one or both embryos 'took.' Have a WTF call with RE. We decide to do one more retrieval before insurance runs out (thanks, COBRA.) Doctor says no birth control this time, and trying menopur.

June 2019- Stim for second egg retrieval. 150 Gonal-F, 300 HMG. Stim day 6, estradiol is 1181, LH is 17.5. Fear that I am ovulating through stims, so IMMEDIATELY start cetrotide. Day of trigger, estradiol is 1262, LH is 0.8. 12 retrieved. 8 mature. 7 fertilized normally. 4 embryos on Day 5...again. Grades are 4AA, 3BA, B2 and B1 (I have NO IDEA what B1 and B2 are....any takers?) (Again, right ovary is a slacker.)

I am (and have been) taking: Vitamin D, CoQ10, Omega 3s, Vitamin E, DHEA, N-AC, Selenium, Magnesium, Baby Aspirin, Vitamin C, prenatal with folate.

Is it really just my egg quality, in spite of age/AMH/FSH? In the last month, I bought a TempDrop to start tracking BBT, though I won't see a pattern for a few cycles. Hoping to see a luteal phase defect or confirm ovulation or both, maybe? I don't carry genes for Celiac's, but do carry 2 hetero mutations for MTHFR. My RE was unconcerned about that, but I have been taking folate and baby aspirin since October 2018ish. In all of your expert opinions, what testing should I seek out? Am I perhaps a 'weak ovulator'? My RE seems content with just continuing on the road of IVF, but I want to use this year off to optimize our future attempts or something!

I’m 22 with PCOS. First IVF cycle after trying for nearly 3 years. 

I’ve been put on 150 iu of menopur every evening, and recently started 0.25 of cetrotide every morning. 

My sister in law did IVF and told me that during her stims she could ‘feel’ her follicles growing and compared it to ovulation pains. I’ve not had this. At all. I’m day 6 of stims and absolutely painless. The only things I’ve experienced are mood swings and headaches. Also nausea when I introduced the cetrotide.

I’ve heard many IVF ladies also get ovarian pain or cramps during it but I’ve had nothing. It’s making me worry that the dose of menopur is too small for me so I’m not growing as many follicles as hoped for. 

At my baseline scan, before stims, I had an AFC of 41.

Hi All,

We need to make a decision on whether we proceed with own Egg IVF or Donor Egg IVF and need a little help to decide. I'd like to hear peoples experiences who are in a similar situation and the statistics they were given.

We can probably afford two IVF attempts (from borrowed money) or a single Donor Egg attempt with hopefully some frozen for a second roll of the dice. We would be going to Czech for IVF or Czech/Spain for Egg Donation.

Quick stats so far

Me: 35, Male

* Don't Drink or Smoke, look after myself and eat  well
* Semen; lower end of normal for all parameters apart from Morphology which was low at 1% & 0.5% over two tests.

Partner: 41, Female

* Doesn't Drink or Smoke, looks after herself and eats very well, health weight.
* Normal Anteverted Uterus
* 1x2cm subserous fibroid left side ""not of significance""
* Antral follicular count of 2 on each ovary
* AMH: 4.8 pmol/L or  0.672 ng/mL
* Normal gonadotrophins, prolactin, testosterone & thyroid all ""normal""
* ""progesterone confirmed ovulation""

What are peoples experience with similar/slightly worse/slightly better stats to the above? We read a normal chance at IVF for a 40-42 year old is 10%? Would the stats above reduce those odds or increase them as she is physically health? Are those odds realistic?

After your experiences would you roll the dice with own eggs or jump straight to donor eggs? Just asked my partner, and she feels fine with donor eggs but I can't help feeling she would probably prefer own eggs.

81,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey everyone. So, my wife and I have been having issues for several years now. She's much more eloquent than I am, so I'll just paste what shes typed up. I'm Jesse, she's Michelle.

We're both excited and nervous and also worried.... I'll let her expain:

From Michelle: In 2016, we made one of the biggest decisions of our lives. I went off birth control because Jesse and I were ready to start our family. I had been ready for some time, but wanted the timing to be ideal. I also wanted him to be ready, which took a little patience and lots of changes. I finished graduate school and obtained my license. We got married, Jesse moved to Maryland and we both started new jobs. I had been reading up on all things baby making to manage my expectations of the process and identify our ideal fertile times. I bought the ovulation tests, downloaded fertility apps and diligently plotted my cycles. We did everything right… so we thought.

We tried every month for nearly a year before seeing our doctors. Jesse connected with a new primary care provider August 2017, who made a few referrals to specialists [navigating that process was frustrating in itself]. He finally got an appointment with a urologist for the end of October and had his first sperm analysis.

Meanwhile, I had my annual gynecology visit end of September 2017. I informed my OBGYN that we had started trying and for how long. She examined me, as usual, and informed me that she felt something - a suspected fibroid. I was referred for follow up testing, which confirmed that I had 3 fibroids. The one my doctor felt was sizable. She reassured me that she had delivered plenty of healthy babies to women with fibroids, but she also hit me with her retirement from medical practice. She told me, ""You can be as aggressive as you want. We don't have to wait a full year."" She referred us to Shady Grove Fertility, where we had our first consultation November 2017. By the time we met with them, we had learned that Jesse was not producing any amount of sperm. He was referred to another more specialized urologist.

We worked with our teams for nearly 8 months from that point. I had sonograms and an HSG to check for other uterine abnormalities. Jesse started a host of medications, had numerous blood draws, had a panic attack during an MRI and had more sperm analyses completed. We obtained a second opinion regarding all his results and treatment plan. My tests determined that my tubes were clear, and my fibroids weren't distorting my uterus. Finally, some good news! I ovulate normally, regularly and without assistance despite a moderately low AMH (low egg reserves, unknown quality).

The diagnosis remained dismal for Jesse - no naturally produced sperm found. Ever. We were formally diagnosed with male factor infertility due to idiopathic azoospermia. We were informed that our options were surgical biopsy/extraction or donor sperm. Given the test results, surgery success was extremely low. We made the decision in September 2018 to move forward with donor sperm. My RE felt confident we could try intrauterine insemination (IUI) with donor sperm. I decided I wanted to try natural IUI (no medications, no ovulation trigger) first to work with my body's natural ecosystem. We spent time selecting a donor bank and reviewing profiles. We even moved into a bigger rental with the assumption that we'd need the extra space soon. Everything looked like we'd be back on track.

It was at that point, we were hit by another unexpected shock. Jesse's insurance carrier refused to cover our treatments any further. We were informed that it was a contractual denial because we were pursuing treatment with donor sperm. The policy only allows coverage when using the spouse’s sperm; we even had to prove that we were legally married before continuing treatment. I was gutted again. We had carefully gone over the benefits package together when Jesse took his job. We chose the higher cost plan because it meant paying less in copays and deductibles. However, we were not aware that fertility treatment would be grossly restricted. We didn’t even know we would have challenges when we were trying to make the best decision for our health needs at that time.

I spoke with the SGF financials team about costs and options. Standing in a hotel parking lot, audibly crying, in the middle of a conference, I canceled our first IUI because we didn't have $1800 ready to go.

We regrouped and made a plan. I'm a self employed therapist so my income isn't always consistent. If I took a full time position for someone else, I'd have to close my practice and abandon clients I, ethically, can't keep. I already work 3 side jobs [that's a whole other thing] so completely changing employment wasn't a great option. We applied for need based assistance with SGF and were approved for a 5% discount on treatment.

After weeks of crying and number crunching, we were forced to take out a small medical loan to cover the cost of donor sperm and balance from each IUI procedure. We underwent three rounds over the winter. Spoiler alert: we never got pregnant. We have nothing to show for our efforts except credit card debt, loan debt, a stack of bills and payment plans with everyone. I needed a break after it all, which I took after our last failed cycle in January 2019. I'm grateful for the pause, and I'm excited to restart our quest for our family.

We are going to continue IUIs with donor sperm; IVF is not likely in our future. Our hope is to officially start after returning from vacation at the end of August, which would put our first appointments during the first week of September 2019. We're going to give it another six rounds. If science and the universe conspire in our favor, our Pennababy will join us in 2020.

<p>I spoke with the SGF financials team about costs and options. Standing in a hotel parking lot, audibly crying, in the middle of a conference, I canceled our first IUI because we didn&#39;t have $1800 ready to go.</p>

<p>We regrouped and made a plan. I&#39;m a self employed therapist so my income isn&#39;t always consistent. If I took a full time position for someone else, I&#39;d have to close my practice and abandon clients I, ethically, can&#39;t keep. I already work 3 side jobs [that&#39;s a whole other thing] so completely changing employment wasn&#39;t a great option. We applied for need based assistance with SGF and were approved for a 5% discount on treatment.</p>

<p>After weeks of crying and number crunching, we were forced to take out a small medical loan to cover the cost of donor sperm and balance from each IUI procedure. We underwent three rounds over the winter. Spoiler alert: we never got pregnant. We have nothing to show for our efforts except credit card debt, loan debt, a stack of bills and payment plans with everyone. I needed a break after it all, which I took after our last failed cycle in January 2019. I&#39;m grateful for the pause, and I&#39;m excited to restart our quest for our family.</p>

<p>We are going to continue IUIs with donor sperm; IVF is not likely in our future. Our hope is to officially start after returning from vacation at the end of August, which would put our first appointments during the first week of September 2019. We&#39;re going to give it another six rounds. If science and the universe conspire in our favor, our Pennababy will join us in 2020.</p>

A plethora of tests were done, in short my wife has borderline PCOS. My SA test came back ok, count high, but progression fair.

I had a DNA fragmentation test done which came back at 40%. This took me back but the consultant did not seem concerned. Whilst I had some doubt I put my trust in them. Anyway they recommended IVF+ICSI.

My wife had 11 follicles, and 6 mature eggs. All 6 eggs fertilized successfully with ICSI, and all 6 embryo's went onto day 5 blastocysts.

Great right? I had not expected a 100% progression rate, I thought we would end up with maybe 1 or 2 embryo's due to the DNA fragmentation results which meant there maybe fertilization issues or embryo's stop growing after day 3.

IVF Fresh Cycle #1 in March 2019, single embryo transfer, ended in a 5 week chemical pregnancy.

During our follow up what went wrong appointment, I asked again was it due to my sperm results and I was told we had a 100% blasts rate, so the consultant shrugged it off and told us it must have been a poor quality embryo and try again.

Frozen Cycle #2 in August, single embryo transfer, again ended in a 5 week chemical pregnancy, albeit with a stronger beta HCG to start with.

To go through any pregnancy loss is devastating, to go through 2 losses within 6 months has utterly left us feeling broken.

We have 4 embryo's left, we can PGS test these, but the data on whether PGS testing embryo's will help seems to be inconclusive. It would also mean the embryo's need to be thawed and frozen again.

I feel the DNA fragmentation issue must be the cause here, however why did we get 100% success earlier with the embryo's.

At the appt we were hopeful that just some hormonal therapy to regulate my cycles and maybe IUI after a month or two. They ran a hcg test because I was due for my period that day and it came back with a level 4. Because of my past early losses I thought, well that’s just a little chemical pregnancy don’t get worked up.

Over the next week we continued betas and every two days my numbers were doubling! The RE decided to treat it like a real pregnancy and set up all the appts(more than usual cause I’m high risk geriatric y’all). Then my 4th beta came back and the number was lower than before. There was maybe 24hrs where my husband and I thought, ok maybe this one is real!! And then they went down again and again. 

I had a lot of clots and bleeding last week so when I went in on Monday I was really hoping to get a low or 0 level but it was 197(previous one was 49). When I got into work I got a call to go in for an ultrasound ASAP. Left work and they couldn’t find anything of significance on either ultrasound scans. Next day I met with the RE again and they recommended doing an endometrial biopsy to see if maybe some tissue got left in the uterus to rule out ectopic. 

Went in two days later(levels still rising) and OMG THAT SHIT IS PAINFUL!! They recommended that I call in sick the next day just in case the endo biopsy did not: A) have any  pregnancy tissue and B) get my numbers to begin to fall.

That brings us to today(and I’m so sorry this is so long!). I go in for a consult with another RE that they told me to, and he begins with, “sooo why are you here again?” None of the tests got submitted(hcg, tissue from the super painful endo biopsy) and he has no notes why they schedule for me to meet with him. I am fairly annoyed as I’m at day 20 of going in for blood tests, many of which I’ve been congratulated on my pregnancy to which I need to say no it’s not a good one. But anyhoo I bring him up to speed that I just want to rule out ectopic because I really really don’t want to get the methotrexate shot and have to put off trying for more time than I have to. He asks if he could do one more ultrasound with his own eyes just to be sure.

He found the ectopic pregnancy within five seconds hiding between my right ovary and the tube opening. Fuck. Well it is what it is, they warned me yesterday to be prepared to get the shot. So I say ok I guess we will keep the 1pm appt that you made yesterday. Nope, no notes made about the appt they told me to take work off for... took them about three hours but they finally found an infusion center that can take me.

I HATE SHOTS(who doesn’t) but I’m a child I felt like dashing out of there when she told me to lean over for the bum shots(one on each cheek). My sweet husband tried to distract me with videos and holding my hand lol. Ok. It actually wasn’t bad at all. Felt almost like getting blood taken. Burned a little afterward and a little sore now but it’s done. 

If you’ve made it this far you are a SAINT. So here I am, now I just...don’t think about TTC for at least a month?? I don’t even know what that looks like. Do I get a period after the shot?

After my second failed FET, I did an ERA that came back pre-receptive and currently waiting on results of my second ERA to confirm receptive timing.

My shot was on 8/6 and I’m wondering whether those of you who have done Depot Lupron and gone straight into an FET cycle waited for your period to return or went straight into estrogen priming?

I don’t really care about timing—I want to do what’s right and my doctor doesn’t have much experience with this. 

My nurse told me “we could cut out the two weeks of birth control, which could speed up the timing” and then “I assumed we would wait for your period since you have regular cycles. You’ll need to shed this old lining and start with a new one.”

116,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi All,

This is an insurance heads up for Progyny subscribers.

Progyny separates coverage into “smart cycles”, and you only get so many.

For our plan, 1 egg retrieval = 3/4 smart cycle and 1 FET = 1/4 smart cycle.  Apparently it varies by company.

Progyny covers most fertility testing and also most medications.  There’s coinsurance and we still pay something, but all in all it is an amazing benefit.

Here is the thing:

Progyny counts semen cryopreservation as 1/4 of a smart cycle.

We found this out yesterday when I was checking our balance after our canceled FET.  

My husband saved some semen a while back and didn’t understand the Progyny plan terminology.  (I was doing stims and I couldn’t focus on it.)

He accidentally used up 1/2 a smart cycle (2* 1/4).  The services would only have cost $300 each.  And so we accidentally used up 2 chances at FET, which obviously cost much much more (labs, ultrasounds, medication).

Apparently Progyny sometimes lets people reverse charges and pay out of pocket so you can retrieve smart cycles for other uses.  We are trying but it isn’t certain.  Hoping it works for us. 🤞🤞

FYI.

My husband and I live in two cities right now. We travel back to our “home” city once per month for work meetings and to check on our house, etc. I have a friendship with two girls from his work and the three of us would hang out, etc. Since this all started, both have become pregnant and given birth and I’m just out here chilling. I’m writing this as I’m about to go meet one of them for a glass of wine. I’ve been actively avoiding her because her whole world is her child and despite my multiple comments that its “not a topic I want to discuss” she still asks. I don’t think she’s very socially aware and the fact that she works at my husband’s small company which is overrun with gossip wills me to not want to discuss our fertility issues with her.

It’s a limited social interaction and I’ve sandwiched it between a work meeting and a dinner to have an “out.” But I’m just so irritated with the fact that I don’t really want to drink, but I know that if I deny this request, the first topic will be “ohhhhhhhh why aren’t you drinking?” I just don’t have the patience, it’s easier to have the glass of wine.

More importantly, my anxiety about this limited social interaction has made me keenly aware of how heightened my anxiety is about next weekend. My husband and I are going to visit a dear friend of mine for the weekend. She and I had been close for years. With both of her children, it took one month for them to conceive. After she had the first child, my husband and I started trying and were having issues, navigating the standard testing/HSG/sperm analysis, seeing an RE, etc. When I shared with her, she gave me the most irritating response ever, “Oh you’re putting too much pressure on yourself, just relax, it’ll come.” F. You. That conversation directly impacted our friendship as I found myself avoiding her slightly more and just realizing she’d never understand. 

When she called me to tell me she was pregnant with her second child (again, single attempt), she asked how things were going. I told her we had made little to no progress, had moved on to meds and IUI’s and had been diagnosed with “unexplained fertility.” She was kind and said she felt terrible hearing all that after having shared her news. I was so happy for her, genuinely. I adore her children and will always be happy for her. But, she also just cannot relate. In the same conversation, she tried to “help” by explaining that friends of her sister were just about to adopt a baby because “they had spent thousands on all kinds of treatments and nothing worked, but now they had a child on the way!” It was meant to be positive, and I realized that, but all I heard was the path ahead of me laid out by someone who could not possibly grasp the emotional toll that it takes.

So of course I want to see her. But I’m dreading the topic. I’m dreading my response.

I could just really use a place to vent and maybe some advice. I'm 35, my husband is 36. Unexplained infertility and RPL. We've been trying for a full three years. Five iuis last year, two ended in chemical pregnancies. Each iui I had three-four follicles and the former re warned of risks of multiples. Clearly wasn't a risk for me.

Then I had two spontaneous pregnancies, one a blighted ovum and the other another chemical. We can only afford one egg retrieval for ivf. My amh is 1.29, fsh is 8.5. Not the worst. The new re thinks my problem is my borderline low thyroid and has medicated me for it, I'm now in the normal range. Idk how my previous re missed that for over a year, but oh well. Anyway. 

I went for my suppression scan after BCP. Only 7 follicles, the re thought that was lower than what he'd expected but OK. I took 300 gonal f and 2 vials of menopur. Three days later, only three follicles responding and not too great. Increased menopur to three vials. Two days later, day 6, only two follicles at 10, one at 9, everything else small. We decided to cancel. Stopped taking all meds.

We went back today, four days later. I have two follicles at 15, one at 13, one at 12, one at 10. Lining is 9mm, thicker than it was on trigger day for any of the iuis! The re cautioned against trying on our own, saying we could have quints. We're already out of pocket about 5k for meds and monitoring. Is it insane to want to try on our own? I feel like worst case, it'd be another miscarriage. Or it doesn't work but at least we tried. Am I just thinking crazy because I'm desperate? I trust my doctor, I just worry this is somehow our chance.

&#x200B;

As the title suggests, I'm new to the sub. Bit of an intro first: I'm 26 and my partner is 25. We've been actively trying since January 2018, started Letrozole 2.5mg in January 2019 to induce earlier ovulation to squeeze more in for the year (my cycle is 29 days, LP is 12 days).

My partner had his sperm analysis done in January - he is all clear with great morphology, count, etc.

I had all my bloods and scans done in December of last year, and a HyCoSy (which showed a small uterine fibroid) was done in March, but at this stage, our infertility is completely unexplained.  
No history of infertility, endo, PCOS or any other potential causes in my family or his (my older sister conceived at 35 with no issues, another is currently pregnant with her fourth, and my partner's mother had her youngest at 43 without any assistance) so we really have no explanations. I ovulate *every single cycle* and we've done everything we can do to give ourselves the best shot.

Anyway, my OBGYN has decided she wants to do a Laparoscopy and Endoscopy, which is booked for 16th August, and I'm having my pre-op appointment tomorrow. I have no idea what to expect, what questions to ask, where we go from here, etc. and just want some advice or words of comfort from those who have been here too?

I'm super nervous because we've waited so long for a reason as to why we just aren't having any luck, and I'm also a little nervous about what the outcome of this surgery will be. What will it do? What is she looking for? What happens next? What if it doesn't show her anything?

No history of infertility, endo, PCOS or any other potential causes in my family or his (my older sister conceived at 35 with no issues, another is currently pregnant with her fourth, and my partner&#39;s mother had her youngest at 43 without any assistance) so we really have no explanations. I ovulate <em>every single cycle</em> and we&#39;ve done everything we can do to give ourselves the best shot.</p>

<p>Anyway, my OBGYN has decided she wants to do a Laparoscopy and Endoscopy, which is booked for 16th August, and I&#39;m having my pre-op appointment tomorrow. I have no idea what to expect, what questions to ask, where we go from here, etc. and just want some advice or words of comfort from those who have been here too?</p>

<p>I&#39;m super nervous because we&#39;ve waited so long for a reason as to why we just aren&#39;t having any luck, and I&#39;m also a little nervous about what the outcome of this surgery will be. What will it do? What is she looking for? What happens next? What if it doesn&#39;t show her anything?</p>

<p>Please help!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

Background: My husband had a mTESE done 2 weeks ago. The fertility clinic took the sample and did their thing with it and said that they didn't find any sperm in the sample they were sent.
Standard procedure with our urologist is that when he is in doing the mTESE he also takes a sample of some of the worst tissue to send in for pathology so that when the fertility lab gives their results he has something to look at and say this is why they didn't find anything. 
We went to a follow-up with the urologist for the mTESE on Friday Aug. 2nd. The urologist had yet to get the results back from pathology which he said was weird as normally it only takes about a week to come back (follow-up was 2 weeks after mTESE). So he called the in town lab and they said they had sent it to the University of Michigan for a second opinion. Obviously my husband and I are thinking the worst. Urologist says he'll call us as soon as they get him the results. Well he called today and the pathology from husbands mTESE surgery came back and said that there was sperm in some of the worst tissue. So why the fuck is the fertility clinic saying that there was no sperm in the best tissue the urologist could find. They had TWO different pathology labs do tests on the samples and they both confirmed that there was sperm. The urologist says this has NEVER happened before. 
We are planning on going to the urologists office in the morning and trying to get a copy of the pathology report. Then we're going to go to the fertility clinic/RE and ask WTF happened? From there we will have to decide what we do next, but I'm about done with this clinic.

147,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"First -why should you listen to me?  I'm an Obstetrician/Gynecologist in the United States recently out of residency, and an infertile for 4 years. 

What is this? There are regularly comments about what your Ob/GYN is qualified to do, or what they aren't qualified to do, and the regular question of - should I see an RE?  So to shed some light on this I thought it was time to update the last saved thread and offer my 2-cents. 

&#x200B;

To become an OB/GYN in the US, you start with 4 years of medical school.  Years 1-2 are more traditional book-learning education, and years 3-4 clinical- IE hands on patients.  Every single US medical student does a core of rotations 3rd year - Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Surgery, OB/GYN, Psych, Peds.  Then over 4th year you can add on things you're interested in.  For example, myself and other OB/GYN wannabe's spent an extra 6-8 months of 4th year focused on surgery, OB/GYN and sub-specialties, peds/NICU.  Residency comes next where you spend 3-5 years in your chosen specialty - OB/GYN is 4 years.  Within that 4 years you learn obstetrics - pregnancy, delivery, Cesareans, and gynecology - surgery, contraception, hormones, infertility, bleeding... if it happens to your vagina/vulva/uterus/tubes/ovaries/pelvic floor - I'm your doctor.  You also spend a *minimum* of 3 months in each OB/GYN sub-specialty: 

\- REI - Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility

\-GynOnc - Gynecology Oncology

\- MFM - Maternal Fetal Medicine

\- Urogyneology or Pelvic Floor Medicine

Each sub-specialty carries a fellowship of an additional 3 years of training.  However, there is plenty of time built into residency to spend extra time with any sub-specialty, as it interests you.  And a residency program will come with an REI - the time you spend training as a generalist is with the REI directly.  I spent my time in the OR as his partner for surgery, interpreting monitoring/baseline labs, reviewing/editing protocols, managing complications, performing ultrasounds, assisting in retrievals and transfers - all of it.  As hands on as a fellow, just not as long.  Also, when not on your REI rotation - you see infertile patients in clinic and initiate work-up and evaluation and refer on as needed.  

&#x200B;

*So what, exactly, is my general OB/GYN qualified to do?*

First, while generalists are not REIs, they are absolutely qualified to initiate an infertility work-up and may be more qualified to treat and evaluate certain causes that are also gynecology disease - endometriosis, polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis, ovarian cysts/tumors, tubal factors, congenital anomalies.  They are absolutely trained in evaluation of baseline hormones (thyroid, estrogen, progesterone, LH/FSH, prolactin) and should know when the REI referral is needed.  They could be as qualified, if not moreso, in diagnosis and evaluation of recurrent miscarriage/pregnancy loss.  As far as surgical treatment - hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, treatment of fibroids/polyps/ovarian or adnexal masses - all highly trained surgical sub-specialists.  

Some OB/GYN generalists will have extra training in infertility treatments - including IUIs, clomid inductions, letrozole - depending on their interest and experiences. They can personalize their clinic and seek additional training and education.

Lastly, most REIs do not monitor the entire pregnancy or deliver - so you'll likely end up back with this guy if you make it to the other side.  

&#x200B;

*So when do I go to the RE?*

If you're asking this question, you likely should ask for the referral.   An excellent generalist knows their limits, and will know when to send you on.  And if you as the patient are ever uncomfortable with a treatment plan, or ready to advance treatment or even get a second opinion - an excellent physician will happily make a referral and set up that second opinion.  

I do think it is a waste of REI resources for a young, un-diagnosed couple who have only tried a few months with no other risk factors to go straight to an REI.  However almost none of you on this thread routinely or popping through fit this description.  So it is a balance.  Yes, it can feel like sometimes the generalist is ""wasting time"" - but the reason that ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - the governing body for OB GYN) defines infertility of no success at 1 year under the age 35 - is because most couples (85% specifically, sources are available) will achieve pregnancy within that time period with no intervention.  It can be hard to be told to wait, but it often is all that is needed.  This sub is a fantastic example of selection bias. 

But, if you have known risk factors, if you have a complicated reproductive history, heck if you're just really not comforted by your OB/GYN's answers - then go to the REI!  Go go go! Ask for the referral.  Personal anecdote - I would 1000000x rather you ask me for the referral for a second or sub-specialty opinion than for you to not understand / be confused / be unsettled at all about your care.  Making sure you're 100% on board with your care is part of my job.  

&#x200B;

*A comment on MFM*.  

Once you become pregnant, most REIs send patients who had IVF or other ART to be evaluated by an MFM early in the pregnancy.  This is the expert on complicated pregnancies and ensuring healthy mom/baby.  Again there is a LOT of overlap between what a generalist can do and the MFM, but don't be surprised if you get that referral if you get to the other side.  Or even have a pre-conception referral. 

&#x200B;

*A comment on bad doctors*. 

They absolutely exist.  Doctors are people too, with different personalities and bad days.  This is not an excuse - as patients we pay too damn much money and are too emotionally involved - it's okay and expected to have standards and expectations.  Just try to remember that one bad experience does not = bad doctor and even more so, that the entire specialty is bad.  Absolutely identify a bad fit however, and GTFO (if you have the resources) to a different doc.  Know that you may HATE Dr. So-and-so, but Karen down the street may find Dr. So-and-so amazing, and you just be happy that you don't have to interact with either of them.  As I always tell patients about when they google medical advice: people forget to rave about good experiences that met expectation, but they will tell everyone-and-their-dog about the bad burrito that they had at Chipotle last night or the bad doctor experience yesterday.   That doesn't mean that Chipotle only makes bad burritos.  

&#x200B;

What really prompted this post however, is that personally I love this sub.  I am constantly blown away and inspired by the people who contribute and support me and each other. But there are often comments that are very anti-OB/GYN or any doctor other than an REI, and even REIs.  And that's okay, because nobody is perfect and I love that this is a safe place for everyone to vent - it's so very needed.  But it's emotionally difficult and confusing, personally.  That being said, I wanted to comment to provide the best info and support -if your doctor isn't helping you to feel 100% comfortable with your treatment, then it's not working for either of you.  It's important to me that women get good care, and its disheartening to see the poor examples of that.  I think it's also important that we are aware when we use our anecdotal experiences to give hard-line internet advice.  

 Rant over.  Thank you all for reading!

TL-DR: OB/GYN generalists are completely qualified to initiate your baseline infertility evaluation and some even are more qualified than REIs for specific diagnoses.

I will try my best to adhere to the guidelines of the community but please be gentle.

History:  This is through Kaiser Clinic.

1. Early diagnosis of DOR - low AMH and high FSH.
2. 2 failed IUI\`s - (started with 75 IU GonalF, 75 IU Menopaur, post 5th day ultrasound the dosage was changed to 150 IU GonalF, 75 IU Menopaur)
3. The doctor ordered for more tests and we found out the genetic condition is the reason for DOR, FragileX carrier hence we have to get additional PGT(PGD) embryo testing done to rule out carrier embryos.
4. 1 failed IVF - ( 150 IU GonalF, 75 IU Menopaur) we stopped the cycle after seeing only 1 follicle consistently over the stim days.
5. Current IVF - ( Doctor advised to moved Antagonist protocol, we only had time to do 2-3 days of E2 priming and then started with 225 IU GonalF, 150 IU Menopaur, 0.5 ml Omnitrope until SD10, 1mg Dexamethasone for the first 4 days.)

Throughout our journey we have only seen one follicle in all of our ultrasounds and hence are on a no-pill list and that is one of the primary reasons we have moved to injectables instead of trying out the medicines and then straight to IVF.

We had an ultrasound on Monday(SD6) and saw 1 follicle, we have an ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow(SD8) to see if there are any new follicles but the doctor advised us against getting our hopes up given our history and also told us to come prepared to let the clinic know if we are going to do a retrieval which would then be scheduled for the weekend.

The questions we have are:

1. Has anyone else been thru similar things where no matter what they had tried the end result was only 1 follicle after the stims.
2. Should we use these injectables because no matter what they dont seem to have any effect at all, if anything leading to more scars on the abdomen.
3. Are there any other protocols we should look into ?
4. Assuming the history repeats, should we consider 3,4 follicle retrievals over the next 3,4 cycles and then do fertilization of these 3,4 follicles and embryo testing, transfer and so on ?
5. What advice do you guys have for us to follow, either in terms of the queries to the doctor or any advice that worked for you.

History: started trying in August 2015, when I pulled out the Nuvaring and started tracking and using OPKs. My husband and I were both just about to turn 29. Things were going well: my periods came back and my cycles were normal, OPKs showed standard ovulations (CD13-16), no luck in those first few months but I figured my system was still shaking out the hormones after a decade-plus on birth control.

Then my husband got sick. It started as a nasty UTI. He’d never had one before and tried to ignore it. That... backfired. It got really bad. He took OTC meds but the pain never fully went away. He went to a urologist who prescribed antibiotics. The pain still didn’t go away. The urologist discovered the infection had moved backward through his system and become a bladder and prostate infection. He prescribed a month-long course of super-strong antibiotics, plus nightly sitz baths for the pain and inflammation. My husband had a terrible reaction to that particular antibiotic - turns out he is allergic to sulfates - and they had to treat the allergic reaction, then start all over on a different antibiotic.

We were still “trying” during that time, but obviously getting my husband healthy was our priority. I thought this was when a pregnancy would happen for us: during the hallowed “relaxing and not thinking about it too much” phase. Nope.

We did our first SA in late 2016. The results were... apocalyptic. I don’t remember the exact numbers, but every one of them was low. The urologist said the combination of the infection/inflammation in his reproductive system (the prostate is involved with semen production), the powerful antibiotics, and the sitz baths had basically done - have you ever heard of a controlled burn, where they burn a forest or prairie down to almost nothing? That’s what happened to his sperm. The infection was gone, but the inflammation and scarring would take a long time to heal, and might never be 100% again. His numbers weren’t zero, but they weren’t great.

We kept trying and he went back for another SA in mid 2017. This one went better. Not great. The doctor said there was a possibility we could get pregnant on our own, but we’d “have to get lucky.” We did not get lucky.

In the mean time, they tested me for everything. You name it, I’ve had it shoved up inside of me. HSG: clear. Saline test: flawless. Ultrasounds of all stripes: great. Hormone levels: fine. Periods: regular. Ovulation: happening. Pregnancy: nope.

We first went to our RE in April 2018. We did a retrieval in May with ICSI. 11 mature eggs, 9 fertilized, 6 developing on day 3, two still going at 5, which resulted in one PGS-certified embryo. A second retrieval yielded almost identical results - three embryos, one left after PGS.

Our first transfer was last September. It was the first time I’d ever seen a positive pregnancy test.  It didn’t last long.

I also had a horrible skin reaction to the suppositories. So while I was losing my perfect embryo I was also dealing with a ton of physical pain, plus - of course - the most stressful week of my entire career.

I don’t remember a lot of October or November of last year. I fell into a depression. I ate a lot of pizza and drank a lot of wine. I read books about grief. I had thought we’d go right back for a second transfer, or do another retrieval, but I couldn’t bring myself to even make the follow-up WTF appointment.

I emailed the RE office asking for a therapist referral and they gave me a list. Folks: see a therapist. It has been life-changing for me. 

My husband switched to a reproductive urologist early this year, who did another SA in January. My husband’s numbers were better than ever - not an A+, but a strong C+/B- -but the first DNA frag test showed 26% fragmentation. He was put on Clomid and supplements for fragmentation. 

The urologist said we had as good of a chance as anyone else of getting pregnant on our own, so we’ve been doing that. No luck. 

This month marks four years since we started trying. A couple weeks ago, my real-life “infertility buddy” had her take-home baby from treatments. The baby shower was the week I would have been due if my transfer had worked. That was agonizing. I got my period last weekend and sobbed myself to sleep. I had a dream that I was giving birth. It was so realistic that I woke myself up “pushing.” I decided I was done waiting.

We saw our RE again today. He wants us to do another retrieval before we transfer again, since I ideally (ha, ha) want more than one kid. Also so we can do an ERA. I asked about the suppositories and he said we’ll try something different this time, which was a HUGE relief.

The ultrasound showed that my ovaries actually look better than he remembered them looking last year. I’ve stayed on all the supplements (coq10, fish oil, DHEA, etc) and he said it seemed like they had helped. Apparently my right ovary is raring to go this month, so we’re going to try our first-ever IUI this weekend. If that doesn’t work out (has anyone’s first IUI ever worked in the history of fertility treatments???), I’m back on stims next month.

I have done multiple SAs in the past year. The first one showed very low numbers for concentration, motility and vitality. I had a micro-surgical varicocelectomy last year and some of those numbers improved. I have since tried a few different supplements and some of the SAs showed excellent volume and concentration, but progressive motility \[PM\] has been consistently low. The highest one I got was 18%, and I've had a 3% and a 2% (reference value is >32%). On the 18% SA, total motile sperm count was pretty good (around 50 mil), but on the rest of them it's usually between 1.5 and 8 mil, which is not good.

I've done quite extensive research but tips for improving PM are generic: lose weight, stop drinking, stop smoking, etc. Well, I don't smoke, I seldom drink and haven't had any alcohol in this past year. I'm not slim but far from obese (190cm 94kg). Not an athlete but I do bike or run 2 or 3 times a week. Been avoiding the bike too just to be safe.

Doctor suspected bacterial infection but culture came back negative. I took 20mg prednisone for a month to rule out an autoimmune process, and vitality did go up to 70% (was always between 40 and 50%, RN >52%), but PM was 2%.

I've tried different supplement rounds and have been consistent for a while: a bunch of antioxidant vitamins, L-carnitine, CoQ10, zinc, selenium. All prescribed. Haven't gone back to the doctor - waiting for a scheduled SA at the end of this month. The 2% PM test was after a couple of months on this supplement recipe.

I've done DNA frag test and it was around 18.5% (TUNEL, RN <20%).

We've had 2 ICSI rounds and had 7 D3 embryos but none made it past that, and I've learnt that the male DNA kicks in at around day 3. So everything indicates that my side is at fault here.

Thought I'd share this here and see if anyone has any tips.

I totally understand that infertility can drive people to seek alternative solutions. While they can be emotionally helpful, physically speaking there is not enough evidence to show that they do increase the success rate.

One of women says she only followed advice from successfully IVF mommy bloggers and contribute that to the cause of her success on first attempt. While some of her advice is pretty standard, the rest of them are out right stupid and useless. Like you have to keep your feet covered, because cold feet means cold womb. (We are living in a tropical country, the temperature is over 30c daily with 90% humidity, my feet are not cold! Ever!). She even told me I need to stop using menstrual cups because the cups rubs against the cervix constantly (No, that’s not how it works). She even has a list of must eat foods (of course it includes pineapple core) before and after transfer and she gives them out like the Bible. 

The other is a little bit of a crunchy mom type. She promotes meditation, talking to the embryos, visioning your future, the power of suggestion type of stuff. She is about the whole chemical free, keeping our body pure for the baby. A couple weeks ago I was gonna get a pedi and she freaked out. I told her doctors say it’s perfectly safe for us to get a pedi once every month as long as we go somewhere clean with good ventilation and avoid products with MMA. She made a huge deal out of it front of our friends, essentially shamed me into saying I wouldn’t go. 

Last weekend my beta turned out negative, and I shared it with the support group. I started getting these comments about how I should have gone with a blastocyst transfer instead of day three embryos. I was instantly annoyed.

These women think they know better than the doctors and technicians because they read mommy blogs and have heard some successful anecdotes. I understand they come from a good place, however, they make it sound like my FET failed because I haven’t done enough visioning, didn’t eat enough pineapples, didn’t wear fluffy socks in 30c+ weather, and how dare I get a pedi once a month.

Been trying 2.5 years, unexplained secondary infertility (we had a stillbirth that we concieved first try). 27F I developed hypothyroidism (hashimotos) after the stillbirth. Husband's SA's have all been great. Only thing we havent had done is a lap (Ive begged my re but she doesnt think i have endo and said even if I did it wouldn't change anything), or a DNA frag test (but we've never had a miscarriage). 

We've been doing gonal f plus trigger shot with TI. My lining has been GREAT since getting off the clomid (typically about 11mm at ovulation), I always have at least one great follicle, and the timing is amazing. Yet here we are.

Can I start with saying that I consider myself extremely lucky. I am 30 and have just married the most amazing, incrediable, funny, smart and kindest man I could ever ask for. In addition to marrying into the most supportive family and having an incredibly supportive family of my own.

My husband was always honest about the fact he had a brain tumour in his hypothalamus when he was a child and it may have damaged his fertility so we took steps early and he had a sperm anaylasis (10 immobile sperm) and he started on gonasi twice a week two months ago to try and boost his lh and fsh into producing natural testorone (he currently takes synthetic testorone every 12 weeks).

They are gonna start weaning him off testorone now and at the end of this month will be the first time seeing if it's made any difference. I know that even if it hasn't it doesn't mean anything atm he's still on the lowest dose and there's another drug option too. And the doctor seems to think we have a good chance of conceiving without ivf with these drugs but icsi is an option if it doesnt. But it's still nerve wracking. 

I was never the type who was desperate for kids. I wanted them eventually  but in a very conceptual way. But since we got married a month ago my mind has been veering drastically between I can't wait to hsve his babies to what if we never have babies to I don't want to have babies I want lots of holidays to far reaching romantic places and to travel the world and just be me and him.

I feel a lot of pressure to try as early as possible (this treatment takes 18-24 months) so that if it doesn't work we have time for ivf whilst I am still young. My husband keeps telling me I am being amazingly supportive about this all and I feel sad he feels so grateful. I think he was always worried no one would love Jim because of it. 
 I know realistically we can't even try for another year but I still feel like my head is splitting in three all the time. How do I keep strong for him without going insane.

I have now had three IVF retrievals.

First: 150 gonal f, 14 retrieved, 10 mature, 7 fertilised, 2 blasts, one fresh and one FET both failed to implant.
Second: 150 gonal f, 7 retrieved, 5 mature, 2 fertilised, 1x 3day 9cell fresh transfer failed to implant, no freezable blast.
Third: 150 gonal f, 7 retrieved, 4 mature, 2 fertilised (with ICSI), 1x 3day 8 cell transferred, chemical, no freezable blast. 

Every fresh transfer i have started bleeding around 10dpo, including the recent cp. 

From my time on this sub I have picked up a lot of information so went into today a (very relaxed) woman on a mission. I asked about a lot of things, including using different stimms and RE has agreed to add some menopur next cycle, so it will be 150 gonal f and something like 75 menopur. Now he's written it up I'm having second thoughts but I feel like I need to do something different as the current protocol just ain't cutting it.

Can someone advise if they have had different results on this stim combo? I have a pretty good AMH for being 35yo (42 pmol/L) and always have a decent amount of good sized follicles at trigger but they don't seem to mature well or as quickly.

Also apparently there's a couple of hours leeway after the trigger so we might look at going to 38hours (something i had never heard of on here so maybe this is interesting to people?). 

We also had the donor egg convo as its looking like a quality problem (which I knew was coming) and I'm ok with that.

I'm posting as much for myself as for anyone out there who needs to know that they aren't alone.

I (30M) am currently unable to talk about my infertility, completely unprepared to tell family about it, and find myself stuck in a cycle of what seems to be anxiety and sadness whenever I am faced with the thought of discussing my infertility with anyone. I find myself having what seem to be panic attacks at random times (for example driving to work) with my mind stuck thinking about fictitious situations where people do not react positively to us explaining that we had to use a donor. I feel helpless to control these thoughts, and can get caught for days in feelings of sadness, embarrassment and panic. I am completely aware that my thoughts are unreasonable and unlikely and that it's not logical to think this way, however this if anything makes it worse.

I'm a normal person, with a great job, and an amazing wife and family. I have infertility which I have known about since before I was an adult. My wife has known about my infertility since very early in our relationship, and has been consistently supportive and compassionate. We are currently undergoing IUD treatment with donor sperm, which has been stressful for both of us for obvious reasons (money, privacy, difficulty of getting pregnant, etc.), but we are making it through and continuing our exciting and stressful journey. 

I've never told anyone about my infertility aside from my wife, and I had not planned on telling anyone either. It became obvious after our first visit to the clinic that silence was not an option. We were urged to be open with our child and immediate family about my infertility and our treatment, which I completely agree is the best option, and in hindsight it was foolish to think otherwise. However, I find myself unable to talk about it, and even the thought of discussing this with anyone causes me to slip towards this cycle of anxiety. 

I am currently on the tail end one of these events. During the last few days I found myself in a state of panic once or twice a day, distracted from work and life, feeling as if my head was full of fog, having trouble sleeping and generally feeling very sad. I have not yet told my wife about this most recent event (she knows about others), and I'm not sure if I will. I will need to get out of these cycles and I don't think I can do this without help. My wife and I have talked about counseling to help deal with these feelings but the idea of telling someone about my current state is sickening; it fills me with dread, fear and embarrassment.

The last time I posted regularly in an online forum, I was moderating a Star Wars message board. I definitely did not think I would be on this sub 10 years later. 

At some point I’ll figure out how to set up my flair, but here’s a little bit about me for now. 35F (36 next month - yikes time flies). Husband and I were going to start trying in July 2014, after we’d been married for almost a year and my job was settling down for a few weeks. But then I was laid off and was paranoid about job hunting and affording medical care while unemployed, as I’m the main breadwinner. Finally started a job 6 months later, took another 6 months to settle in, and we started. One year tracking BBT - nothing. Another year with ovulation trackers - nothing. Meanwhile, EVERYONE ELSE was getting pregnant - like, multiple times. Finally saw an RE last year. I was diagnosed with stage II endo after a lap in November, and the RE said my tubes were likely blocked. Insurance wouldn’t approve IVF until after I had an HSG, so that was a fun, unnecessary, and painful time at the hospital.

Had my first ER and fresh transfer in May. We were able to freeze a few embryos, but the transfer didn’t work. I found that out on the last day of my job after giving my goodbye speech and realizing I still had a pile of work to do and an office to clean out. I texted my mom the result, she called and was not helpful. That’s the only time I’ve ever full on cried at work.

Spent the next week at my new (current) job crashing down from progesterone and trying not to feel like dying from the awful cramps and nausea. Thankfully, I had little to nothing to do, and my supervisor was out the following week. That gave me a lot of time to really think about, well, everything. Why didn’t it work, why is everyone else fertile, do I really want kids, can I even manage being a parent when I get lazy about cleaning out the litter box...

Now I’m in the middle of an FET cycle - transfer day is 8/19. I’ve never experienced so many different emotions in such a short amount of time as I have over the past couple months. This has been rough, but I’m glad this community exists because it’s been really helpful. 

Oh, and fun story about how I found you all: During the fresh cycle stims, I was complaining to my husband about the Ganirelix needle. He googled it (as he always does) and found a comment that compared the needle to a rusty nail. I googled it myself later, because I needed to see for myself that someone else thought that needle was bullshit. I found this sub.

The Short BG: I have PCOS and am 0% ovulatory without help. I’m 28yrs old. I do not have insulin issues that accompany PCOS. We do not suffer from MFI.

I’d take my pill and an hour later the bleeding would stop. As I neared the end of my script, I would spot on and off all day.

I&#39;m at the point of just wanting to throw in the towel and not even continue.  We were going to transfer the final 2 embryo&#39;s but I&#39;m already feeling it&#39;s not going to work.</p>

<p>To address the fluid - it&#39;s NOT hydro, I&#39;ve had a laprascopy/hysteroscopy/dnc on May 6th and there was nothing except silent stage 1 endo.  The fluid is literally &quot;free fluid&quot;</p>

<p>EVERY ultrasound has shown free fluid so I&#39;m on an antihistamine protocol to try and clear it up (mucinex twice a day, clariton once a day, benedryl twice a day and pepcid) while I wait for CD1.</p>

<p>Did you go into transfer knowing it was going to fail and have it be positive or am I just setting myself up for disaster?  I&#39;m doing a full immune protocol for this - neupogen, ldn, prednisone, intralipids, cleocin, prograf and plaquenil along with the pio/endo/estrace but I already feel doomed.</p>

*Throwaway account, names changed for reasons... TL;DR at the bottom*

It's been a rough year so far. Long story short, I've had four miscarriages so far this year (two began at work, which has made work extra hard) and then to top things off, my friend passed away about two months ago. We were close and I've been taking everything really hard. I don't have many other friends and so I haven't had an opportunity to mourn or talk to anyone about any of this. Overall, I'm just not processing things all that well. Lots of crying and generalized sorrow (though I am careful to not cry in front of my husband or anyone else. Mostly just cry in my car). Little bit of an existential crisis wrapped up into all these emotions as well. 

Here's my main issue though. I work full-time M-F and I work with three other pregnant women. No one at work knows about my fertility issues. I'm very careful about keeping work life separate from personal life. 

I am truly happy for these other women who are pregnant, but I am not handling all the pregnancy/baby talk well. It's gotten to the point where I have stopped trying to act like I'm okay. I've decided that I'm really not okay and I'm done pretending to be happy etc. This means I'm doing everything I can to avoid participating in or overhearing pregnancy/baby conversations (which, btw, is alllllllllllllll these women talk about. Understandable, but omg is there nothing else to talk about in your life, Karen!?). When I am around co-workers, I have my headphones in 24/7 now. I'm avoiding all general conversations unless they have anything to do with work and I'm doing everything I can do take trips to other departments so that I can get away from it all. Even with all of this, I am constantly bombarded with baby talk/conversations. One co-worker even started bringing her baby into work to visit all the time now, which is especially hard.

Everything I am going through is obviously affecting my work environment. I'm tearing up constantly, and other, non-pregnant, coworkers are starting to ask if I am feeling okay. I've started declining to attend work-related events just because I can't handle being around all the baby/pregnancy talk.

So, I'm really unhappy at my job right now. I actually do love the work that I do though, so I don't want to quit. It's also a good job with good pay, excellent benefits, and it offers loan-forgiveness! Unfortunately, I really can't see how I can be expected to continue to work in this environment and maintain any level of sanity. I keep thinking about how I'm just going to have to watch all my coworkers get pregnant and raise their kids over the years, while I am... over here having miscarriage after miscarriage apparently. 

I figure I have a few options moving forward:

1. Continue to function with the way things are. Don't tell anyone and figure out a way to mentally process all this sorrow. 

2. Tell a coworker friend (who is not pregnant) that I think I could vent to. The risk with this option is entering into mixing personal life with work life. I don't want the word to get around about my fertility issues, because I don't want to take away from the joy/happiness of my pregnant coworkers. I don't want them to feel like they can't talk about their babies/pregnancy plans and I don't want anyone to feel like they have to tip-toe around me. I also don't want any pity from my coworkers.  

3. Talk to my boss about maybe moving to a different department or switching to part-time? My boss and I are friendly and get along, but I don't know that involving my boss with everything that is going on with me personally is a good idea. 

Has anyone else encountered a situation similar to this? How do you handle all the sorrow while trying to maintain a normal work life? How do you tolerate being around several people who are pregnant and talk about baby planning, etc around you?

In the past, while TTC, I've encountered other friends or acquaintances who became pregnant, but I've never been in a situation where I am constantly bombarded daily with reminders that I am not pregnant and I may never be.

Anyone have any advice or words of wisdom? I'm really struggling here. Sigh/

229,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi, I stumbled upon this sub and figured I would see if anyone has any insight or recommendations.

I recently underwent a SHG and a failed attempt at an EMB. My doctor indicated there was a blockage preventing her from moving forward with the biopsy.  She indicated it appeared I had 3 polyps (size 2 cm - 3 cm) and a uterine anomaly; likely a uterine septum, which could be confirmed with an MRI.  She indicated if the uterine septum was confirmed I would need to have surgery (metroplasty) performed by a RE or advanced GYN surgeon as soon as possible.

Due to the ob-gyns staff dragging their feet on sending my referral for the pelvic MRI, I requested my medical records so I could get another opinion. I recently completed an initial consult with a RE, prior to the RE receiving my ob-gyn records. I discussed the polyps and uterine septum with the RE, who indicates a MRI is not necessary because the SHG would be adequate to confirm the nature of my uterine deformity.

I just picked up my ob-gyn's notes yesterday and noticed the records indicate I may possibly have rudimentary uterine horn, there's no mention of uterine septum.

This is all a bit concerning and overwhelming as my partner and I were about to start moving forward with starting a family.  I've been researching these two diagnosis and it appears the uterine septum is a completely separate diagnosis from a rudimentary uterine.  I've noticed most of the limited info I've found on rudimentary uterine recommends a MRI be completed.

I'm now confused and trying not to rush to worse case scenarios. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

<p>I recently underwent a SHG and a failed attempt at an EMB. My doctor indicated there was a blockage preventing her from moving forward with the biopsy.  She indicated it appeared I had 3 polyps (size 2 cm - 3 cm) and a uterine anomaly; likely a uterine septum, which could be confirmed with an MRI.  She indicated if the uterine septum was confirmed I would need to have surgery (metroplasty) performed by a RE or advanced GYN surgeon as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Due to the ob-gyns staff dragging their feet on sending my referral for the pelvic MRI, I requested my medical records so I could get another opinion. I recently completed an initial consult with a RE, prior to the RE receiving my ob-gyn records. I discussed the polyps and uterine septum with the RE, who indicates a MRI is not necessary because the SHG would be adequate to confirm the nature of my uterine deformity.</p>

<p>I just picked up my ob-gyn&#39;s notes yesterday and noticed the records indicate I may possibly have rudimentary uterine horn, there&#39;s no mention of uterine septum.</p>

<p>This is all a bit concerning and overwhelming as my partner and I were about to start moving forward with starting a family.  I&#39;ve been researching these two diagnosis and it appears the uterine septum is a completely separate diagnosis from a rudimentary uterine.  I&#39;ve noticed most of the limited info I&#39;ve found on rudimentary uterine recommends a MRI be completed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now confused and trying not to rush to worse case scenarios. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

251,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility," I had my first RE consultation yesterday after a little over 1.5 years of TTC and 1 MC. 

It was really eye-opening and I left with, and still have, a ton of emotions. The main take away was that my PCP, who I had been seeing for fertility really had no idea what she was talking about and led us down a path that wasn’t helping and may have been hurting. The main issue is that she put me on Clomid without any type of monitoring or ultrasound.

When the RE went in for the ultrasound, he found a bunch of cysts (some rather large) on both ovaries. Because my PCP didn’t do an ultrasound prior to prescribing me Clomid, we don’t know if these have been there a while or are a result of the Clomid, which I have been on for 5 months. He doesn’t want to do blood work yet because he said the cysts could affect the results and make them inaccurate. He is also suspicious of endometriosis based on my exam but said we need to get the cysts taken care of to see if that was the cause of my tenderness. So while he isn’t completely convinced I have it, he isn’t ruling it out either. 

So now I am waiting until I ovulate in about 10 days to go back in to get a repeat ultrasound to check the size and volume of the cysts and to see if I ovulated on my own. Hopefully, at that point, we can start making some kind of plan and get the bloodwork but he didn’t want to commit to that because he said everyone is different and while we are hoping the cysts go down or are gone, we can’t treat based on hope. I made the mistake of consulting Dr. Google and saw that one of the treatments for the cysts if they don’t go away on their own is birth control, which seems real counter-intuitive when TTC.

I am so anxious for this next appointment. I know 10 days is nothing, but it feels like an eternity. I am also filled with a lot of disappointment and anger at my PCP and I feel really stupid for following the PCP’s protocol, even though there really was no reason not to trust her. I’m really scared we made this situation worse for ourselves by following the PCP’s orders and not going to an RE sooner.

257,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"hey everyone. quick question for anyone that might have some experience with this:


1. how responsive are your doctors? 

it seems like every time i have an appointment with my RE it gets cancelled or changed into a phone call.  i requested an appointment with him last wednesday afternoon (before i went on vacation), and i had to practically beg for them to schedule it! he ended up just pulling me aside for 2 minutes at morning monitoring instead... and i literally hadn’t even seen him in 7 weeks! since another doctor did my first egg retrieval, i saw my doctor one week prior to that, and then not again until 2.5 weeks past my first FET. 

now that i am actually experiencing the physical aspects of my 5w4d loss of my top-rated, pgs normal embryo... i wanted an appointment to go over what could have gone wrong and talk about next steps. that was supposed to be this afternoon. but the clinic just called and said he’d like to talk on the phone instead. am i wrong to be frustrated? is it not normal to want to meet with your RE after a loss? i have a million questions for him, and he always sounds so rushed on the phone. is it worth switching to a different doctor within the clinic?


2. how do you handle your frustrations with your clinic (if you even have any)?

my insurance told me before we started with this clinic in december that we had ivf covered pending medical necessity. since my husband is azoospermic, it’s considered medically necessary and should be covered. 

in the 8 months i’ve been working with this clinic, they reassured me that they checked with my insurance on 4 separate occasions, and that we’re subject to a state mandate that limits us to 2 lifetime rounds of ivf. i was so confused that i asked them to call my insurance back 3 additional times to verify, since that’s not the information i’d been given. they repeated that i only has coverage for 2 lifetime rounds of ivf... so 2 FETs total. 

based on hearing this information SEVEN TIMES from my clinic, my husband and i decided we must have misunderstood my policy, and that the clinic (who must know more than we do) was had the correct information. we decided to pay 4k out of pocket for pgs testing (thinking that we’d rather pay 4k we don’t have in advance to avoid miscarriages- since we only have 2 rounds and can’t afford to pay for ivf out of pocket). we paid the 4k, got the pgs results, had the first fet (which the clinic said had a 96-98% success rate once pregnancy was confirmed... and which ended in a CP at 5w4d last week). 

i called my insurance again last week, and was given the same information i received in november- that my ivf coverage has no limits per se- but that it’s based on medical necessity. i called the finance people at my clinic AGAIN (for the 8th time now) to look into this- and it turns out we were right all along!  we are not limited to 2 rounds as they incorrectly told us SEVEN TIMES. while this is good news for us in the long run- my clinic provided me with the incorrect information 7 times in 8 months, and based on that misinformation, my husband and i spent 4k+ that we don’t have on pgs testing. 

the REs at the clinic were all aware that we were only doing pgs testing because we only had 2 shots at this- and we wanted to give it the best chance we could at working. (as an aside- one RE at the clinic advised us to do it- citing a 10% decrease in MC at my age, and another RE said he doesn’t think pgs is necessary at my age, but that if i wanted to give it the best chance of working, and we only have two tries, i should do it). we NEVER would have done pgs testing if we had known that our coverage wasn’t limited. 

so here we are. we made a $4k, non-refundable decisión based on misinformation provided by our clinic 7 times (even though we made them aware that we believed they were mistaken and begged them to get to the bottom of the discrepancy in information before any financial decisions were made).  i don’t even expect them to refund us...  but they won’t even admit they made an error or apologize at all. i find it infuriating! i have severe medical anxiety and went through the past 3 months putting SO MUCH pressure on myself that this first round HAD to work for no reason. 

and i still can’t even get an in person appointment with my RE :(

i realize how fortunate we are in the long run to have more insurance. i know that this is good news for us. it’s just that- between the lack of access to communication with my RE, the misinformation provided by my clinic SEVEN TIMES which cost us 4k we don’t have and SO MUCH STRESS, and the absence of an apology or admission of fault from anyone at my clinic... i feel like i’m developing major trust issues with them.  i know that this clinic boasts a 70% ivf success rate- and they’re located right in my city- so i’m hesitant to change. at the same time though, how do i proceed with them when i feel like i’m not being heard and not being given the correct information? 

has anyone experienced issues like these before? are they common situations? please tell me if you feel i’m in the wrong. i fully realize that my current physical &amp; mental states are not at their best (as i lay here experiencing my first MC). i’m just so overwhelmed.


UPDATE: thanks so much for the helpful information everyone. it was great to hear about your experiences with your clinics and REs and it definitely made me feel less “crazy” for being as frustrated as i am. 

the doctor didn’t end up calling me yesterday. i waited around and the call never came. i eventually called the clinic and they explained that there was a mishap and that the coordinator that called to change my appt from an in-person to a phone call messed up... the dr. was in surgery and needed to reschedule entirely. i now have an in person appt scheduled with him for tomorrow afternoon. 

i went in for morning monitoring today to make sure my hcg was falling appropriately and had an internal ultrasound. my RE happened to be on morning monitoring so i got to see him briefly. 

after my appointment, my nurse hung back for a few minutes to ask me if i was ok and i ABSOLUTELY lost it. i expressed all of my frustrations with lack of info, lack of access to my dr, and incompetent finance &amp; scheduling departments. i told her that while i like her and my RE, there are many aspects of this clinic that i cannot stand and that i feel incredibly let down. i told her that i would love to switch to a different clinic, but that no others in my area have morning monitoring early enough for me to keep my job. i expressed frustration that i had to keep going there and seeing them even though i feel like i can’t trust them as a clinic.  and i let her know that i was so upset not only with the various mishaps, but that no one on their end seemed to want to take responsibility for them. she was super apologetic and must have taken my comments to heart... since i got a call 2 hours later from the director of operations for the entire clinic 😂

she spent 45 minutes on the phone with me listening to my grievances, apologized PROFUSELY, is refunding my account a minimum of $2,300, investigating my insurance coverage personally, conducting an investigation with my finance personnel, and meeting with my dr / nurse teams to go over the breakdown in communication on my behalf. she insists it’s the clinics fault and that no one on my medical team is frustrated with me... but i feel like i basically just put them on edge and made everyone hate me more.. haha. 

oh well! at least i’ll have actual, tangible information re: my insurance, a partial refund... and it’s all out in the open now? even though i’m terrified that my clinic will just be more frustrated with me... i guess there’s the possibility that we’ll be able to move forward with less bullshit &amp; better communication in the future? my RE already called me personally with my bloodwork results from this morning... so i’m going to take that as a good sign. 

i really wouldn’t have had the bravery to confront them and call them out on everything without the reassurance and perspective from you all. so thank you, thank you, thank you so so much.",[],False,,0,False,RE & insurance rant,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_cjs39g,False,dark,0.77,,public,7,0,{},,d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e,False,,False,False,,{},TW: Miscarriage/Loss,False,7,,self,1564595670.0,,{},,True,,1564523676.0,text,0,,,self.infertility,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>hey everyone. quick question for anyone that might have some experience with this:</p>

<p>the doctor didn’t end up calling me yesterday. i waited around and the call never came. i eventually called the clinic and they explained that there was a mishap and that the coordinator that called to change my appt from an in-person to a phone call messed up... the dr. was in surgery and needed to reschedule entirely. i now have an in person appt scheduled with him for tomorrow afternoon. </p>

<p>i went in for morning monitoring today to make sure my hcg was falling appropriately and had an internal ultrasound. my RE happened to be on morning monitoring so i got to see him briefly. </p>

<p>after my appointment, my nurse hung back for a few minutes to ask me if i was ok and i ABSOLUTELY lost it. i expressed all of my frustrations with lack of info, lack of access to my dr, and incompetent finance &amp; scheduling departments. i told her that while i like her and my RE, there are many aspects of this clinic that i cannot stand and that i feel incredibly let down. i told her that i would love to switch to a different clinic, but that no others in my area have morning monitoring early enough for me to keep my job. i expressed frustration that i had to keep going there and seeing them even though i feel like i can’t trust them as a clinic.  and i let her know that i was so upset not only with the various mishaps, but that no one on their end seemed to want to take responsibility for them. she was super apologetic and must have taken my comments to heart... since i got a call 2 hours later from the director of operations for the entire clinic 😂</p>

<p>she spent 45 minutes on the phone with me listening to my grievances, apologized PROFUSELY, is refunding my account a minimum of $2,300, investigating my insurance coverage personally, conducting an investigation with my finance personnel, and meeting with my dr / nurse teams to go over the breakdown in communication on my behalf. she insists it’s the clinics fault and that no one on my medical team is frustrated with me... but i feel like i basically just put them on edge and made everyone hate me more.. haha. </p>

<p>oh well! at least i’ll have actual, tangible information re: my insurance, a partial refund... and it’s all out in the open now? even though i’m terrified that my clinic will just be more frustrated with me... i guess there’s the possibility that we’ll be able to move forward with less bullshit &amp; better communication in the future? my RE already called me personally with my bloodwork results from this morning... so i’m going to take that as a good sign. </p>

<p>i really wouldn’t have had the bravery to confront them and call them out on everything without the reassurance and perspective from you all. so thank you, thank you, thank you so so much.</p>

TLDR: I’m tired of mothers who did not experience infertility complaining about being “shamed” for...BEING FERTILE. Yep!

Yes, society is rude to all women, but being a fertile mom is literally what society WANTS you to be. It’s like white people complaining about reverse racism. Okay, sure, your kid ruined everyone else’s dinner, you refused to take her out, and you got “dirty looks.” Oh no! How horrible that I, someone who may never have what you got easily for free, doesn’t want to be around that!

Normally I like to be “positive” about IVF. Anxious yes, but not bitter. Well today I’m bitter. Maybe because I’m scared my first FET won’t work but also because I am a member of a lot of FB meme groups (which mostly add joy to my life) but today someone posted a meme about women who pressure childless women to have kids.  I found it funny, as did most moms (because they’re normal moms, not annoying judgy ones) but then OF COURSE this one woman who was a 23-year old mom of a healthy baby was like “IM SORRY BUT THIS IS SHAMING ME IM OFFENDED”

Oh I’m sorry you’re offended that people don’t like being asked personal questions about their child status? Fuck right off. You get to go home and hold your baby and I’m just fucking crying. How can these people take this for granted, be literally the most praised version of “woman” in our society and STILL play the victim?! 

Yes, parents have real problems. Infertile parents exist and they have real problems. But memes about not pressuring others to have kids IS NOT A PROBLEM. I wish my biggest problem was a fucking “offensive” meme.  Seconds later someone else posts “sure 6 pack abs are great but I carried a baby for 9 months my body is superhuman.” Okay, I went through 2 egg retrieval’s, is my body superhuman? 

I told this woman why the meme was funny for most women- because even women who have kids or chose not to have them don’t like being pressured- and I explained that I hardly hate kids, I’m doing IVF myself, and I still enjoyed it. And she still went off about “BUT I FEEL SHAMED.” Suck it up and enjoy your probably unplanned or cycle 1 kid you had at 22.  The other women on the thread who experienced infertility (most of whom now had kids) got the joke and weren’t being ridiculous over it. 

Am I overreacting? Of course. Should I probably quit fb? Yes, but the memes make me laugh so it’s hard and I like having some media in my life that isn’t about IVF. But when will young perfect fertile mothers realize they should be happy, society largely PRAISES them and a silly meme not even directed at them should be ignored? Please don’t tell me to step away from the Internet. Mostly internet stuff makes me happy. This just didn’t.

Meanwhile my husband doesn’t understand why I’m upset, he’s claiming we “aren’t really infertile.” His logic is that because he has CBAVD and we’ve gotten sperm, we no longer have infertility.

It started last Saturday so nearly a week now. Lots of coughing, green phlegm, very sore throat although no fever and strep negative. I'm basically surviving on Advil right now, which I'm told I definitely cannot take once I start the cycle, but it does seem to be slowly getting better. GP wanted to give me a steroid shot and RE said no way.

Well I woke up this morning with pink eye in both eyes. Apparently it can happen with colds. Doctor says it's viral, gave me some antibiotic eye drops with a steroid (in case in turns bacterial). RE says that's okay to take for the week.

Lastly, my stupid TSH. I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's and my TSH has been bouncing around. Was told by RE it needs to be stable and at least under 2.5 before embryo transfer. It had been 2.7 and 3.1 in May. Got an appt with a shitty endocrinologist (only one with availability). So early June my TSH was 2.3. Been on levothyroxine 12.5mcg per day since then. Found out that as of yesterday, my TSH is now 4.1. WTFFFF. How could it have gone up? I ask the shitty endo. She says, well hormones fluctuate. K but I need it to be going the other direction. So now I'll take 25mcg per day and just hope it actually goes down before the transfer. Cool cool cool.

If you've made it this far, you are awesome and I'm sorry to bother you with all this boring crap.

Anyway, my questions are :

1. Can being sick with a virus hurt my IVF outcome? Like in some way worsen my egg quality or something? Surely regular people get pregnant with colds, but in this situation, it seems like the odds are even more stacked against me.

2. Have you dealt with a high TSH before starting an IVF round? Were you able to successfully bring it down in time? I'm freaking out that this shitty endo should have put me on a higher dose in the first place.

3. Have you had a cycle cancelled for either of the above reasons?

She told me she was finished a cycle and had a ton of medicine left over(gonal, Cetrotide, Menopur) and she was willing to give it to me for free. Just had to meet her. We talked for over a week, I offered to pay for shipping and even for some of the medicine but she said she was happy to give it to me and she wants to meet me. We finally set a date and time because my cycle is coming closer. I drive 3 hours to meet her (with my husband cause I was worried) but I drove 3 hours since she said she was driving 3 hours as well and to meet in the middle. I get all the way there and I’m messaging her and she’s telling me she’s running late and will be there soon. I wait over 2 hours and now I’m blocked.

A woman messaged me here on Reddit and she said she saw my post about IVF. She told me she was finished a cycle and had a ton of medicine left over(gonal, Cetrotide, Menopur) and she was willing to give it to me for free. Just had to meet her. We talked for over a week, I offered to pay for shipping and even for some of the medicine but she said she was happy to give it to me and she wants to meet me. We finally set a date and time because my cycle is coming closer. I drive 3 hours to meet her (with my husband cause I was worried) but I drove 3 hours since she said she was driving 3 hours as well and to meet in the middle. I get all the way there and I’m messaging her and she’s telling me she’s running late and will be there soon. I wait over 2 hours and now I’m blocked.
