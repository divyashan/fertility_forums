12,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hi all! I have a follow-up appointment with my RE next week, and I’m making my list of questions. Is there anything else I should ask? Thanks! (x-posted from r/stilltrying)

Mini-background: diagnosed with stage IV endo 3.5 years ago. Right fallopian tube is blocked by scar tissue, left ovary is potentially damaged by previous endometriomas and surgery to remove them. Took aygestin continuously after surgery to prevent periods and hopefully prevent growth of endo.

We’ve been trying for 14 months/19 cycles. The longer I am off aygestin, the more pain I am in and the longer my period lasts. In the last 66 days, I have only had 17 days with no bleeding or spotting. I suspect much of that is a result of a cyst on my left ovary that may have burst around ovulation, given location and timing of horrible pain before that ""irregular"" bleeding started.

The questions on my list: 
*How can I get pregnant if I never stop bleeding????? 
*What is the likelihood of actually getting pregnant, given endo, cyst removal from left ovary, and no functional right tube? 
*What are treatment options that avoid exacerbating endometriosis? 
*If I have another cyst/endometrioma, what does that mean for TTC? 
*Can you tell from bloodwork if cyst is producing estrogen/messing up hormones? 
*Can you tell specifically remaining eggs in each ovary (antral follicle count?) or if left ovary has damage from surgery (functional tube and ovary that has had endometriomas are on opposite sides, feeding the “what’s the likelihood of this working” question)? 
*Should we do testing on specific cycle days? Previous blood tests and ultrasound were CD 27(I think? It can be hard to count when the spotting/bleeding is so frequent) - spotting next day, period started day after. 
*What are the risks of superovulation (letrozole) given endometrioma history? Is there research that demonstrates effectiveness in stage IV endo?

I have a follow-up appointment with my RE next week, and I’m making my list of questions. Is there anything else I should ask? Thanks! (x-posted from <a href=""/r/stilltrying"">r/stilltrying</a>)</p>

<p>Mini-background: diagnosed with stage IV endo 3.5 years ago. Right fallopian tube is blocked by scar tissue, left ovary is potentially damaged by previous endometriomas and surgery to remove them. Took aygestin continuously after surgery to prevent periods and hopefully prevent growth of endo.</p>

<p>We’ve been trying for 14 months/19 cycles. The longer I am off aygestin, the more pain I am in and the longer my period lasts. In the last 66 days, I have only had 17 days with no bleeding or spotting. I suspect much of that is a result of a cyst on my left ovary that may have burst around ovulation, given location and timing of horrible pain before that &quot;irregular&quot; bleeding started.</p>

<p>The questions on my list: 
*How can I get pregnant if I never stop bleeding????? 
*What is the likelihood of actually getting pregnant, given endo, cyst removal from left ovary, and no functional right tube? 
*What are treatment options that avoid exacerbating endometriosis? 
*If I have another cyst/endometrioma, what does that mean for TTC? 
*Can you tell from bloodwork if cyst is producing estrogen/messing up hormones? 
*Can you tell specifically remaining eggs in each ovary (antral follicle count?) or if left ovary has damage from surgery (functional tube and ovary that has had endometriomas are on opposite sides, feeding the “what’s the likelihood of this working” question)? 
*Should we do testing on specific cycle days? Previous blood tests and ultrasound were CD 27(I think? It can be hard to count when the spotting/bleeding is so frequent) - spotting next day, period started day after. 
*What are the risks of superovulation (letrozole) given endometrioma history? Is there research that demonstrates effectiveness in stage IV endo? 
*Can we do a monitored cycle to make sure things are working/no cysts? 
*Should we do another HSG to make sure left tube is still open? (Cost?) It’s been 3.5 years since the last one.</p>

Mr. BC and I brainstormed what this could mean:

-they're busy

-they think we were off-base/rude in giving advice (the RESOLVE link)

-they aren't as good friends as we thought

-they don't view infertility as any real sort of life crisis, or perhaps subscribe to the theory that bad things happen to bad people so have nothing good to say

-they actually read the link and literally anything they would have thought to say was on the 'please don't say' part and therefore didn't say anything

-sad things make them uncomfortable, so they're just ignoring

Not sure what I was expecting exactly, but I kind of thought there would be more ""Sorry you're going through this, see you in a couple of weeks"" which wouldn't have taken very long to write, but would have made us feel better.

Silence is just so hard to interpret!  Hoping I didn't make the wedding super awkward (Mr. BC was afraid of this and hesitated in sending the email in the first place).  Anyone have a similar experience?

Subject: Happy Infertility Week!

Hi...

I guess ""happy"" is a weird preface to Infertility Awareness Week since it is anything but, but I thought I would put it in there to be ironic.

Hope you and your families are all doing well! We thank you for the support you guys have offered us this past difficult year. We've been rather consumed most of 2016 and 2017 by moving, new jobs, doctor's appointments, and of course lots of disappointment.

Anyhow, mainly I just wanted to say how much we're looking forward to seeing you all! We are so happy that we will get to hang out with you at such a happy occasion as a wedding!

I think the #blessed phenomenon in American Protestants is another side of the same coin, or more likely, the the Female Lifestyle Empowerment Brand arises as a secular version from the same historical impulses in American culture. The scholar Kate Bowler has written [a history]( http://katebowler.com/blessed/) of the Prosperity Gospel, which is essentially the Christian version of the Secret (she defines it as ""the belief that God grants health and wealth to those with the right kind of faith"" and it is a HUGE phenomenon in American Christianity) and has about the same emotional and social consequences as the FLEB enumerated above. Bowler, a Christian herself, has also just been diagnosed with terminal cancer and [her personal reflection in the New York Times]( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/sunday/death-the-prosperity-gospel-and-me.html) on the Prosperity Gospel and mortality and illness is absolutely gutting, along with brave and funny and just so fucking smart and humane I couldn’t even believe it was real. 

Anyway, both of these feel like essential reading in terms of making sense of why infertility is so isolating and hard to bear, how our culture has become so hostile to suffering people and suffering women in particular, and (fuck it, I’m just going to go there) how all of these bullshit narratives shift the responsibility for this fucked state of affairs off neoliberalism and capitalism and onto individuals instead, making us too sad and ashamed and exhausted and isolated and confused to organize and build the real power and solidarity that could actually unfuck everything. (I’ve been spending my break from treatment learning how to do socialist organizing, can you tell?)

Anyway, would love to hear how if/how any of this resonates for all of you.

At 22, I was diagnosed with PCOS and stopped ovulating. About a year ago next week, we had our first miscarriage. We have been trying ever since, but I haven't even been able to get a normal cycle, let alone pregnant. I have been fighting my body for a year, obsessive diets, exercise, failure to lose weight. Vegan, Clean eating, blah blah blah. I've been hospitalized once for excessive bleeding. I had a 11 week long period. I went months without a period. I have had so many doctors with their hands, or tools up my snatch, I am starting to feel like a blow up doll. I had a series of partial seizures out of nowhere last month. I am just tired. I'm tired of fighting my body. I feel out of control, and my mental health has suffered severely because of all of this. My ADHD that I spent so long training myself so that I wouldn't have to take medication, has gone off the rails. I am now on Metformin to try and help the PCOS (nope, hasn't), Wellbutrin for the ADHD, Lexapro for my now crippling anxiety and depression, and Naltrexone because nothing else would help me quit my obsessive smoking. I feel like I am so stressed all of the time, that I am barely keeping up with a cycle of work, eating, chores, bills, and repeat.

I'm finding it hard to talk to anyone about how hard it is for me. I have officially been diagnosed with unexplained infertility, and have been through a host of pills, shots, ultrasounds over the past year. When you are young, and it is supposed to be easy, hearing this is the worst, ""but you're so young! It'll happen eventually!"" or ""God has a plan for you to wait and enjoy your husband right now."" (Yes, I grew up evangelical Christian). 

When my husband and I were dating, we had a miscarriage not far into our relationship. I was 19 at the time. At the time, I couldn't have been more relieved to have had a miscarriage. I didn't have to make any hard decisions about what to do next. I even had friends over for a night of drinking and partying to celebrate. It wasn't that I didn't want kids, it was just (obviously) not the right time. We had only been dating for 6 months, and had no idea if we were serious enough to handle it. Looking back, I can't help but be disgusted with myself, and imagine where we would be now if I hadn't had that first miscarriage. 

I know this isn't very cohesive, but I had to get it out. It's been eating at me for weeks, and I was starting to feel like I was going to go insane if I didn't talk. So, if you're reading this, thanks.

I feel like I am so stressed all of the time, that I am barely keeping up with a cycle of work, eating, chores, bills, and repeat.</p>

<p>I&#39;m finding it hard to talk to anyone about how hard it is for me. I have officially been diagnosed with unexplained infertility, and have been through a host of pills, shots, ultrasounds over the past year. When you are young, and it is supposed to be easy, hearing this is the worst, &quot;but you&#39;re so young! It&#39;ll happen eventually!&quot; or &quot;God has a plan for you to wait and enjoy your husband right now.&quot; (Yes, I grew up evangelical Christian). </p>

<p>When my husband and I were dating, we had a miscarriage not far into our relationship. I was 19 at the time. At the time, I couldn&#39;t have been more relieved to have had a miscarriage. I didn&#39;t have to make any hard decisions about what to do next. I even had friends over for a night of drinking and partying to celebrate. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t want kids, it was just (obviously) not the right time. We had only been dating for 6 months, and had no idea if we were serious enough to handle it. Looking back, I can&#39;t help but be disgusted with myself, and imagine where we would be now if I hadn&#39;t had that first miscarriage. </p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t very cohesive, but I had to get it out. It&#39;s been eating at me for weeks, and I was starting to feel like I was going to go insane if I didn&#39;t talk. So, if you&#39;re reading this, thanks. I know it&#39;s hard for everybody, and that I&#39;m sure others have far more tragic stories, but it helps knowing there are people who understand that it hurts.</p>

I'm a few months shy of 37, have a history of cancer and chemo, and am overweight. I can feel the judgement from people and it all seems to land on me. I should have tried to get pregnant earlier, I'm not really sure what I should have done about the cancer, and I most certainly should lose weight (and I have - surprise! didn't get me pregnant). 

I've felt all of these feelings for a long time, but am feeling particularly heated about them this morning, after our surprisingly good egg retrieval results, and the possibility that ours was an undetected MFI issue all along.

Here's my incomplete list:

-To the nurse that told me I better get started having kids if I wanted them. I was 31 and not yet married. Not helpful. Also, fuck you.

-To my mom that asks every few months if my cancer history is what's causing problems with our ability to concieve - all doctors have said most likely no, and the answer is the same each time you ask.

-To my mother in-law (and all of my husband's extended family for that matter), who is well meaning, but I'm pretty sure thinks her son married a defective uterus, rather than a complex human woman, just stop.

-To any random person ever who has told me to just relax. Sorry, that's not my style, or the problem.

-To my BIL and SIL who took a while to conceive, considered taking Clomid but were afraid of birth defects (??), after which BIL likes to claim that they almost did IVF. Spoiler, he doesn't know what IVF is.

Who's on your list?

In October we found out my husband had cancer, so we banked 9 vials of his sperm - 5 for IUI and 4 smaller ones for IVF. In January I started lupron injections of 10ml and on Jan 19 I started stimming with 300 of Menopur and 600 Follistim. We triggered with pregnyl on day 9 and retrieved on day 11 with I think 14 follicles ranging in sizes of 11-22. They only retrieved 12 eggs and only 4 were mature. 1 more became mature in the petri dish, so 5. None fertilized.

They diagnosed me with shitty egg quality (that's the proper medical term, right?) and told us our only hope was to use donor eggs. After 3 months of searching they matched us with someone that has donated 3 times before: 30 eggs/24mature/19 fertilizied/singleton pregnancy, 26 eggs/20 mature/14 fertilized/twins, and 20 eggs/20 mature/19 fertilized/triples. So she's basically the queen of magical ovaries. She is available in a few months.

2 weeks ago I had a laporoscopy and hysteroscopy where they removed stage 2 endometriosis and 2 polyps in my uterus. Also my previously thought blocked tubes were deemed officially open for business.

There's no way to tell if I actually have shitty unusable eggs or not, but everything else is good to go. Is it worth to take the $1,000 gamble on trying IUI with the banked sperm when we will have to drop 20x that for the donor in a few months?

In the room, she has the five stages of grief written on a dry erase board: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. This is pretty relevant since the likelihood of ever having a bio child from my eggs has been described to me as ""less than 1%,"" I've had to really grieve the loss of a biological child. 

However, since my husband's successful vericocele surgery, I keep thinking about trying old non-IVF treatments, thinking the surgery will boost our chances with IUI, or even natural conception.

The main reason why we are going to counseling is to talk about donor eggs and adoption and decide on one path. That goal sounds like someone who has reached the acceptance stage, right? But here I was back to bargaining, assuring myself that if we got a good SA, we'd be able to try IUIs again and maybe they'd work.

38,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"No scientific research in this one -- it’s just a rant. It was recently my 35th birthday, you know, the birthday where women in American society ritually celebrate the death of their fertility by eating shit-tons of cake. ;-)

I had a birthday party and about half of the people there (closer friends) know about my infertility issues while the other half (less-close friends & acquaintances) do not know. 

I was looking forward to some relaxing time with friends. Next year, I should specify on the invitation that, in lieu of gifts, will be no discussion of my fertility or lack thereof for the duration of the party.

I got bingoed by two child-free friend-quaintences at my own birthday party! And then inadvertently semi-bingoed by a well-meaning friend. Luckily, I’m in a state of mind where none of this was particularly upsetting -- I hoped a bingo-free birthday wouldn’t be too much to ask.

Here’s the story.

I overhear the following conversation between two women (~30 and ~45 years old), both are child-free and are sitting near me at the party. About a year ago, I had told the ~30-year-old about being in the middle of IVF treatments and she was supportive. I had never discussed any family plans with the 45-year-old and hadn’t really caught up with her much in the past 1-2 years. 

The two women are discussing being proudly child-free. Cool -- I appreciate having friends who are child-free -- if my path ends up going that direction, I won’t be alone. 

I overhear their conversation shift to discussing how though they did not want kids themselves, they were excited when their friends had kids. Cool! 

Then I overhear the 30-year-old woman say to the other, “... Well, I know for a for a fact that Forest is trying… actively working on it...” WTF, friend who I told about IVF a year ago?!? Who wants their TTC status to be broadcasted -- especially when the actual status is “things aren’t going well”? Maybe some people think that “doing IVF” means “will for sure have a baby any day now.” I was pissed, but, whatever, we aren’t particularly close these days, this is my birthday party and I want to move past the bingo and enjoy the party. I figured that was the end of that.

A little while later, the 45-year-old starts chatting to me. We discuss how I’m looking to change jobs and go through several different options that I’m looking at, she shares some ideas and talks about and her own semi-recent job change. Cool. She is a very independent woman, is often single, travels the world, loves wine, etc. I am enjoying catching up with her.

Then she says to me: “Well, what about different types of jobs?” 

I wonder if this is the usual conversation that comes up about switching out of the demanding job/industry I work in and into a different field. 

Me: “What do you mean?” 

Instead she says: “How about… (super cheesy tone) MOTHER?” 

Me: “Huh?”

Her: “What about… (still cheesy tone) MOTHER???”

Me: “Urg, ehm, bleargh… I’m 35 and I’ve been married almost ten years. I think that ship would have sailed by now.” 

Her: “Well, I am 45!” 

Me: (Still taken aback.) “Um, bleargh, well, I think the sort of job I’m looking for is…” 

I had so many other great ideas of what to say (l'esprit de l'escalier) but really did not I want to have the “I’m infertile and you’re insensitive; mother isn’t a ‘job’ per se and even if I were a mother I would be a working one” conversation at my birthday party. I just wanted to have a good time with my friends!

Seriously, how many 45-year-old child-free women don’t know that asking about fertility is not really a birthday party topic -- especially if we literally haven’t hung out in a year or two and aren’t super close?

Then I go walk over to another group of friends. Another friend who is also 35, married about a year with no kids, is complaining that her mother does not seem to understand that deciding to try to have kids and actually getting pregnant are not the same thing. (It seemed like she is alluding to fertility issues or taking longer than she hoped.) She does not know about my infertility problems.

She asks, “Forest, how do you deal with people asking YOU?” 

Me: “It’s easier because people assume that I don’t want kids. When you’re 35 and married almost ten years, most people stop asking.”

I guess it’s probably time for me to reach out to this friend because maybe she’s struggling. But my 30-year-old friend who spilled the beans on my TTC status only minutes earlier at the party doesn’t really get me psyched to bring more people into the circle of trust.

My best friend saw the “how do you deal with people asking you” part and apologized that I had to get that bingo at my party. She’s the best. I told her it was no big deal, really, I just want to enjoy the day, etc. I told her about the first two bingoes and she was piiisssed about that.

<p>I overhear their conversation shift to discussing how though they did not want kids themselves, they were excited when their friends had kids. Cool! </p>

<p>Then I overhear the 30-year-old woman say to the other, “... Well, I know for a for a fact that Forest is trying… actively working on it...” WTF, friend who I told about IVF a year ago?!? Who wants their TTC status to be broadcasted -- especially when the actual status is “things aren’t going well”? Maybe some people think that “doing IVF” means “will for sure have a baby any day now.” I was pissed, but, whatever, we aren’t particularly close these days, this is my birthday party and I want to move past the bingo and enjoy the party. I figured that was the end of that.</p>

<p>A little while later, the 45-year-old starts chatting to me. We discuss how I’m looking to change jobs and go through several different options that I’m looking at, she shares some ideas and talks about and her own semi-recent job change. Cool. She is a very independent woman, is often single, travels the world, loves wine, etc. I am enjoying catching up with her.</p>

<p>Then she says to me: “Well, what about different types of jobs?” </p>

<p>I wonder if this is the usual conversation that comes up about switching out of the demanding job/industry I work in and into a different field. </p>

<p>Me: “What do you mean?” </p>

<p>Instead she says: “How about… (super cheesy tone) MOTHER?” </p>

<p>Me: “Huh?”</p>

<p>Her: “What about… (still cheesy tone) MOTHER???”</p>

<p>Me: “Urg, ehm, bleargh… I’m 35 and I’ve been married almost ten years. I think that ship would have sailed by now.” </p>

<p>Her: “Well, I am 45!” </p>

<p>Me: (Still taken aback.) “Um, bleargh, well, I think the sort of job I’m looking for is…” </p>

<p>I had so many other great ideas of what to say (l&#39;esprit de l&#39;escalier) but really did not I want to have the “I’m infertile and you’re insensitive; mother isn’t a ‘job’ per se and even if I were a mother I would be a working one” conversation at my birthday party. I just wanted to have a good time with my friends!</p>

<p>Seriously, how many 45-year-old child-free women don’t know that asking about fertility is not really a birthday party topic -- especially if we literally haven’t hung out in a year or two and aren’t super close?</p>

<p>Then I go walk over to another group of friends. Another friend who is also 35, married about a year with no kids, is complaining that her mother does not seem to understand that deciding to try to have kids and actually getting pregnant are not the same thing. (It seemed like she is alluding to fertility issues or taking longer than she hoped.) She does not know about my infertility problems.</p>

<p>She asks, “Forest, how do you deal with people asking YOU?” </p>

<p>Me: “It’s easier because people assume that I don’t want kids. When you’re 35 and married almost ten years, most people stop asking.”</p>

<p>I guess it’s probably time for me to reach out to this friend because maybe she’s struggling. But my 30-year-old friend who spilled the beans on my TTC status only minutes earlier at the party doesn’t really get me psyched to bring more people into the circle of trust.</p>

<p>My best friend saw the “how do you deal with people asking you” part and apologized that I had to get that bingo at my party. She’s the best. I told her it was no big deal, really, I just want to enjoy the day, etc. I told her about the first two bingoes and she was piiisssed about that.</p>

<p>And that’s my rant -- I’m adding my bingoes to the pile. Thank you all for understanding these moments!</p>

RANT:
My sister had 2 children 11 months apart, both unplanned, no longer with the father, and says she hates her life now. She has 2 other kids from a previous relationship as well. For over 5 years I've been as supportive as I can, babysitting, influencing and encouraging her, and helping financially when she really needed it.

My mother helps her so much more because she lives with my mother. Over the past 6 months or so, I've been reminding her it's hard to hear her vent about hating her pregnancy or being upset since she gave birth.

I feel I remind her too often that I can't deal with it and don't want to hear it. Pregnancy for her is a choice, she can take free birth control if she doesn't want kids. She knows my husband and I are struggling to have a baby. She knows about the meds, tests, ultrasounds, pending trigger shot and IUI. She knows everything about what I'm going through, but still chooses to vent to me when I say I cannot handle her emotions. She can go see a counselor to get professional help and guidance. I saw one a couple of weeks ago and may be calling her back to see her again. I even told my sister about how good it felt to see a counselor. I just don't know how else to tell her I cannot handle her emotions about choices she had control over. Fortunately I don't have to explain the struggles of infertility here, since you all understand how hard it is, but man.... She really doesn't consider my feelings while going through this.

At this time I cannot switch RE's because I have Kaiser and it is all in house if I want to use my medical coverage.


As an intro, I have PCOS, diagnosed in 2005, polycystic, insulin resistant, acne, the works. In 2008 I had my left ovary and fallopian tube removed due to a dermoid cyst which had completely destroyed it. The fallopian tube removal was an unpleasant and unplanned surprise the surgeon decided on because ""I wouldn't need it"". My vitamin D and iron are also a little low, but I'm working with a dietician to improve my numbers and I'm now at the low end of normal.


In January of 2016 I finally made an appointment with an RE (I was 34). Got in to see her in March and had all the tests run over the next month, HSG included. All of my numbers were good and my remaining tube is clear. My FSH test at 5.5 mIU/mL in March 2016 and tested at 6.5mIU/ML in March 2017. My husband has excellent numbers 90% motility at +4 so he's good to go. I don't have a regular period without birth control with them ranging from every two weeks up to 10 months apart. At that time I was averaging a period about every 47 days. We go over all of my insurance info and it covers all diagnostics and 6 IUI's with meds. IVF is not covered at all. We get an IUI cycle started in April on 100mg Clomid, I get 2 follicles at 17mm and 18mm. Two days before the IUI I find out I have to have shoulder surgery for a work injury and so we had to cancel the cycle. I had surgery in August and I was off of pain meds by November so we started another cycle. My IUI's since then have gone like this:


1. November 2016 : 100mg Clomid, 1 follicle at 18mm on cd23, trigger shot and IUI. Negative.

2. December 2016: 150mg Clomid, 2 follicles at 22mm and 25mm on cd 12, trigger shot and IUI. Negative. Doctor thinks he did the IUI too late. Shocker.

3. January 2017: 150mg Clomid, 75iui Menopur for 1 day, 1 follicle at 17mm on cd 16, trigger shot and IUI. Negative.


*** I had been telling my RE for two cycles now that I don't think I was ovulating when I was supposed to with the trigger shot and I had opk's to prove it. She runs some tests and I'm right. I haven't been absorbing the medication sub-q for the past 3 IUI's. Awesome. So next time I get IM shots instead. Whatever works.***


4. February 2017: 200mg Clomid, 75 iui Menopur for 1 day, 1 follicle at 18mm on cd 17, trigger shot, IUI. Negative.


*** Sat down with my RE to go over the treatment plan she has for me. I was really getting upset that I was not being listened to. I told her I hadn't wanted to do the round of Clomid at 200mg and that I said so at the time and I was over-ruled. I had been told injectables were out of the question and it was Clomid or nothing. She said that injectables are an option for me but the doctor that saw me that day didn't sign me up for the class on how to do the shots so she didn't want to do it that cycle. I was upset at that and the waste of my time, a covered cycle and what I told her was laziness bordering on incompetence and I was not happy. 200mg Clomid was never discussed, it makes me feel horrible and gives me terrible migraines and on 200mg my lining was only at 4.2mm. That isn't enough to sustain a pregnancy.  Even if by some miracle I had gotten pregnant it probably wouldn't have lasted purely based on the numbers they knew before they even did the IUI, but didn't bother telling me! I left in tears, but my RE promised we'd do injectables next cycle and finally signed me and my husband up for a class to learn to do the IM injections (which we had half already been taught because sub-q doesn't work for me). She also said any injectable cycle that didn't produce at least 2 follicles wouldn't count against my covered cycles.***



5. March 2017: 150iui Menopur for 6 days, 1 follicle at 18mm cd 7, trigger shot, IUI, Negative. Doctor says the egg matured too fast and probably wasn't a good quality anyway and didn't count that IUI against my insurance.


*** Had another sit down with my RE. We talked about dosage for Menopur. I told her I'd rather over stimulate and have to cancel at this point rather than under stimulate yet again. The goal we had with injectables is 3-4 follicles. It has become rather obvious I am not responding well to low doses. She said the highest I could have is 300 iui Menopur. I asked her since I do have PCOS if Menopur really is the best injectable for me since some women with PCOS already have high LH. She assured me it is what I should be on.***


6. April 2017: Started on 256 iui Menopur for 4 days and then the doctor increased the meds to 300 iui for another 8 days. My Estradiol after 4 days was at 129pg/mL. On day 6 it was at 125pg/mL. I was concerned because it had dropped instead of increasing and when I had my ultrasound on day 7 I asked about it. There we 3 follicles at 12mm, 10.5mm, and 10mm. The RE on duty assured me the drop was probably just the smallest follicles dropping off to leave me with these 3. I came back 4 days later for another ultrasound and lab work. I did the ultrasound first and there was now only 1 follicle at 16mm. The RE on duty cancelled my labs and scheduled me for my IUI 4 days later. Once again, my concern over my lab work results was blown off and I was right. So this cycle doesn't count against me again, but now I'm well into my TWW and I'm getting crampy. I know it didn't work again. 


So now I don't know what to do. According to the pharmacist and the PA 300 iui Menopur (4 vials) isn't the highest dose, 6 vials is. The pharmacist wanted to know why I wasn't using Follistim instead and mentioned that it is covered by my insurance. I would like to talk to my RE again before the next cycle starts and have a proper idea of what comes next because right now I'm running all out of ideas and hope. I feel like my RE has wasted most of my covered cycles by not doing the right tests and not listening to me. I can't switch doctors, as much as I'd really like to, or clinics entirely, as I have to take what I get with Kaiser, and of the other two RE's in my clinic one won't do injectable IUI's and the other thinks money is no issue and  everyone should just jump into debt with IVF. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know anything else to ask for that I haven't already. I don't know what to insist on. I was already taking the maximum Menopur that my RE was willing to prescribe. If she doesn't increase the dose how can she or I expect better results? Any ideas or advice would be appreciated.

My vitamin D and iron are also a little low, but I&#39;m working with a dietician to improve my numbers and I&#39;m now at the low end of normal.</p>

<p>In January of 2016 I finally made an appointment with an RE (I was 34). Got in to see her in March and had all the tests run over the next month, HSG included. All of my numbers were good and my remaining tube is clear. My FSH test at 5.5 mIU/mL in March 2016 and tested at 6.5mIU/ML in March 2017. My husband has excellent numbers 90% motility at +4 so he&#39;s good to go. I don&#39;t have a regular period without birth control with them ranging from every two weeks up to 10 months apart. At that time I was averaging a period about every 47 days. We go over all of my insurance info and it covers all diagnostics and 6 IUI&#39;s with meds. IVF is not covered at all. We get an IUI cycle started in April on 100mg Clomid, I get 2 follicles at 17mm and 18mm. Two days before the IUI I find out I have to have shoulder surgery for a work injury and so we had to cancel the cycle. I had surgery in August and I was off of pain meds by November so we started another cycle. My IUI&#39;s since then have gone like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>November 2016 : 100mg Clomid, 1 follicle at 18mm on cd23, trigger shot and IUI. Negative.</p></li>
<li><p>December 2016: 150mg Clomid, 2 follicles at 22mm and 25mm on cd 12, trigger shot and IUI. Negative. Doctor thinks he did the IUI too late. Shocker.</p></li>
<li><p>January 2017: 150mg Clomid, 75iui Menopur for 1 day, 1 follicle at 17mm on cd 16, trigger shot and IUI. Negative.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>*** I had been telling my RE for two cycles now that I don&#39;t think I was ovulating when I was supposed to with the trigger shot and I had opk&#39;s to prove it. She runs some tests and I&#39;m right. I haven&#39;t been absorbing the medication sub-q for the past 3 IUI&#39;s. Awesome. So next time I get IM shots instead. Whatever works.***</p>

<ol>
<li>February 2017: 200mg Clomid, 75 iui Menopur for 1 day, 1 follicle at 18mm on cd 17, trigger shot, IUI. Negative.</li>
</ol>

<p>*** Sat down with my RE to go over the treatment plan she has for me. I was really getting upset that I was not being listened to. I told her I hadn&#39;t wanted to do the round of Clomid at 200mg and that I said so at the time and I was over-ruled. I had been told injectables were out of the question and it was Clomid or nothing. She said that injectables are an option for me but the doctor that saw me that day didn&#39;t sign me up for the class on how to do the shots so she didn&#39;t want to do it that cycle. I was upset at that and the waste of my time, a covered cycle and what I told her was laziness bordering on incompetence and I was not happy. 200mg Clomid was never discussed, it makes me feel horrible and gives me terrible migraines and on 200mg my lining was only at 4.2mm. That isn&#39;t enough to sustain a pregnancy.  Even if by some miracle I had gotten pregnant it probably wouldn&#39;t have lasted purely based on the numbers they knew before they even did the IUI, but didn&#39;t bother telling me! I left in tears, but my RE promised we&#39;d do injectables next cycle and finally signed me and my husband up for a class to learn to do the IM injections (which we had half already been taught because sub-q doesn&#39;t work for me). She also said any injectable cycle that didn&#39;t produce at least 2 follicles wouldn&#39;t count against my covered cycles.***</p>

<ol>
<li>March 2017: 150iui Menopur for 6 days, 1 follicle at 18mm cd 7, trigger shot, IUI, Negative. Doctor says the egg matured too fast and probably wasn&#39;t a good quality anyway and didn&#39;t count that IUI against my insurance.</li>
</ol>

<p>*** Had another sit down with my RE. We talked about dosage for Menopur. I told her I&#39;d rather over stimulate and have to cancel at this point rather than under stimulate yet again. The goal we had with injectables is 3-4 follicles. It has become rather obvious I am not responding well to low doses. She said the highest I could have is 300 iui Menopur. I asked her since I do have PCOS if Menopur really is the best injectable for me since some women with PCOS already have high LH. She assured me it is what I should be on.***</p>

<ol>
<li>April 2017: Started on 256 iui Menopur for 4 days and then the doctor increased the meds to 300 iui for another 8 days. My Estradiol after 4 days was at 129pg/mL. On day 6 it was at 125pg/mL. I was concerned because it had dropped instead of increasing and when I had my ultrasound on day 7 I asked about it. There we 3 follicles at 12mm, 10.5mm, and 10mm. The RE on duty assured me the drop was probably just the smallest follicles dropping off to leave me with these 3. I came back 4 days later for another ultrasound and lab work. I did the ultrasound first and there was now only 1 follicle at 16mm. The RE on duty cancelled my labs and scheduled me for my IUI 4 days later. Once again, my concern over my lab work results was blown off and I was right. So this cycle doesn&#39;t count against me again, but now I&#39;m well into my TWW and I&#39;m getting crampy. I know it didn&#39;t work again. </li>
</ol>

<p>So now I don&#39;t know what to do. According to the pharmacist and the PA 300 iui Menopur (4 vials) isn&#39;t the highest dose, 6 vials is. The pharmacist wanted to know why I wasn&#39;t using Follistim instead and mentioned that it is covered by my insurance. I would like to talk to my RE again before the next cycle starts and have a proper idea of what comes next because right now I&#39;m running all out of ideas and hope. I feel like my RE has wasted most of my covered cycles by not doing the right tests and not listening to me. I can&#39;t switch doctors, as much as I&#39;d really like to, or clinics entirely, as I have to take what I get with Kaiser, and of the other two RE&#39;s in my clinic one won&#39;t do injectable IUI&#39;s and the other thinks money is no issue and  everyone should just jump into debt with IVF. I don&#39;t know where to go from here. I don&#39;t know anything else to ask for that I haven&#39;t already. I don&#39;t know what to insist on. I was already taking the maximum Menopur that my RE was willing to prescribe. If she doesn&#39;t increase the dose how can she or I expect better results? Any ideas or advice would be appreciated. </p>

I'm not having much luck searching information about peoples experience with this test on google, this forum or others. I guess the point of this post is to gain knowledge of other people having used an SDI test and share knowledge for future people seeking advice or information about SDI-testing.

I found 4 people from our sub and sistersubs who had had this test done but 2 of them got pregnant only a few days after posting that they where looking into the test so it was unrelated to the SDI-test. 1 had multiply ectopics and has stopped posting about a year ago. 

The last person which I found over in infertilitybabies has had an SDI-test but never mentions it again. User History shows they had better results at their new clinic where they had said they would use TESE due to the SDI-test showing significant DNA-fragility. 

I also tried searching maleinfertility but it there was no hits related to Sperm DNA-testing for: DNA, SDI, DFI or fragmentation.

**What is an SDI-test?**

The Sperm DNA Integrity (SDI) test provides a measure of the DNA fragility index (DFI) in a man’s sperm. 

* Below 15% DFI - Normal(robust DNA)
* Between 15-25% - Moderate fragility
* Over 25% - High fragility

**If you have bad DFI results can it be changed?**

According to the research Yes it can often be changed with lifestyle changes. There is no guarantee but it could help focus your efforts.

**Why are we looking into this?**

We haven't had the most encouraging results from IVF and all the doctors are able to tell us is ""Sperm and Eggs look good!"". Yet we are only able to get fertilized eggs if we use ICSI - No explanation as to why this happens.

With ICSI our fertilization rates is 33%, it is better then nothing but according to my online research there should be an answer as to why we are below 50%. Several pages hints that you should look to a reason when having results below 50% with ICSI. Yet our clinic hasn't mentioned more testing and when I asked about figuring out why it was so low they didn't have any test we could do.

Dammit! I need some answers! ""Unexplain"" doesn't cut it when we are nearing our last funded cycle. I hate this feeling of shooting with a blindfold on.

A coworker contacted me wanting information about my RE and was actually able to get an appointment next week. I've had others reach out and open up about their own experiences. AND, I even had a male coworker tell me that I've really opened his eyes and made him aware of what it must be like to want something so much and to continuously be told, ""no!"" even after putting so much work and effort into it. 
So, I thought I'd share with the people who get it most. 

Day 1 post: This week is National Infertility Awareness Week. As someone who has been diagnosed with infertility and struggled to conceive naturally for years, this is such an important week for me. This video is from last year but is too awesome not to share as it asks so many great questions! Why is infertility testing and treatment not covered by insurance? Why aren’t women educated about their reproductive system from an early age? Why do others feel the need to pry into our business and offer unsolicited advice? And if you’ve been trying to conceive for 6-12 months without any luck, why aren’t you seeing a specialist? Don't be afraid to go before it's too late. https://youtu.be/p2sajh6AuPg

Day 2: 1 in 8 couples have trouble conceiving or sustaining a pregnancy. We fight feelings that no one could possibly understand. Infertility is a constant state of grieving. Infertile couples grieve month after month after month. We grieve over a lifelong dream that is lost as cycle after cycle fails. We grieve as the little human being we’ve always wanted drifts further from reality. We grieve as we watch you fulfill the dream we want more than anything else. Humans are not equipped to be able to handle this constant state of grief and it becomes unbearable. Someone around you is currently struggling and needs your support. Be kind and don't offer advice. Just listen and love. https://youtu.be/mk1lAk6PUio

Day 3: Infertility Misconception: It is almost always the woman's fault. 
Infertility Fact: Research has shown that women with
infertility have the same levels of anxiety and depression
as do women with cancer (resolve.org)
Educate yourself, become aware, and pay attention to your bodies!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcbSO90OtyA&feature=youtu.be

Day 4: For National Infertility Awareness Week, I thought I’d include some tips and advice on interacting with/supporting an infertile friend.
Things NOT to say to a struggling couple: ""Just relax. It’ll happen!"" ""I can just give you my eggs."" ""As soon as you stop thinking about it, it’ll happen."" ""Why don’t you just adopt?"" ""We’re so fertile, I can just look at my husband and get pregnant."" ""Have you tried eating organic?"" ""My best friend’s sister got pregnant after a failed IVF so it can happen!"" ""Are you sure you’re doing it right?"" ""Maybe you weren’t meant to have children."" ""It just wasn’t part of God’s plan."" ""You can have my kids!""
Things You SHOULD say to a struggling couple: ""I’m here for you."" ""Please let me know how I can help."" ""I promise to listen and offer hugs when needed."" ""How are you?"" ""I’m thinking of you."" ""I love you."" ""You are strong! I’m proud of you."" ""I know this is hard and it totally sucks!"" ""Can I get you some pizza and ice cream?"" 

(I also posted a lot of funny infertility memes with this post)

Day 5: Today's National Infertility Awareness Week post is about fertility. Women, we have to advocate for ourselves and one way to do that is by really understanding our bodies. I highly recommend reading ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" by Toni Weschler. I read this before we started trying to conceive and was in complete awe of how little I knew about my body. Every girl should have to read this as a teenager. (Guys would really benefit from reading it too). Because I'd read this book, I knew something was wrong when we weren't getting pregnant after just a few months. I went to my OB and started treatment early, which was smart. What wasn't smart was sticking with the OB. If you're struggling to conceive, get yourself to a Reproductive Endocrinologist! We wasted too much time with an OB and it was almost too late.

<p>Like, should we freeze some sperm just in case something happens to him over there?</p>

<p>This is all so fucking hard and I feel totally unprepared to get all the info and ask all the questions in a 30 minute consult.  </p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

First 4 IVF cycles: 3 transfers, 2 pregnancies, 2 miscarriages. 1 frozen blast from the last cycle that I didn't want to use because I was too scared of another miscarriage.

Cycles 5 and 6 resulted in 3 blasts that have passed PGS. 

I then went into a holding pattern as my crohn's disease had become very active, triggered in part by the IVF. After 8 months of treatment and 2 colonoscopies I was declared fighting fit again and ready to start treatment (of interest, I was prescribed Humira for my crohn's, which is also sometimes used in IVF cycles to manage immune issues. It has been amazing).

This year I have done:
 - 1 medicated cycle to trigger ovulation (Gonal F + Pregnyl/HCG trigger), followed by a hysteroscopy to check everything was ok. It was! I was quite worried about ashmerman's after three d&cs for the 2 MCs so this was a relief.
 - Second medicated cycle to trigger ovulation (Puregon + Pregnyl/HCG trigger), followed by mock transfer. It also went well.

So then we get to this cycle. Plan was to do a medicated cycle to trigger ovulation (Gonal F + Pregnyl/HCG trigger), followed by day 5 transfer. We cancelled last night after 17 days of stims (50 units of gonal F), as my follicle never grew above 15mm, and E2 was dropping. It got to 600 at about day 8, and then dropped to 450 and stayed there. My lining never got above 6mm. My fertility specialist said he did not understand what was happening (I like that he was honest), and it was safer to cancel then use one of my embryos. I am still going to trigger tonight, and then when it gets to CD1 we will start again.

Two questions:
 - Any ideas on why the E2 dropped and follicle didn't grow? With the 8 medicated cycles I have done (6 IVF + 2 ovulation induction) this has never happened
 - My fertility specialist is suggesting a HRT cycle rather than medicated ovulation induction. I have tried to research comparable outcomes, but can't find anything clear. Does anyone know more about this?

I can't believe I actually think that enough to be posting here.

We also did a test that said we had an immunology issue in my uterus that could only be resolved with lipids. Something my dr doesn't practice. So we moved on to a gestational surrogate.

While scheduling an egg retrieval appointment he called me back to say we should try to transfer 1 more embyro. But doesn't want to do anything about my immune system. So basically it'll just be another failed IVF transfer.

While scheduling an egg retrieval appointment he called me back to say we should try to transfer 1 more embyro. But doesn&#39;t want to do anything about my immune system. So basically it&#39;ll just be another failed IVF transfer. </p>

<p>Is he doing this cause he wants the cash? Is this a thing dr&#39;s do?</p>

On Monday, the day before my first ever transfer, we wanted to do something fun/relaxing/awesome and cram in a bunch of things I won't be doing if it works. So we decided to take the train 2 hours up to disneyland, as we often do, but this time with the mission of getting on all the big rides where expectant mothers should not ride, and maybe a little drunk at California Adventure. One potential hiccup: we've never had to do any shots away from home yet and I needed to take my PIO at 9. Not really excited about being home by 9, we decided we'd have to figure this shit out eventually and packed up the meds. I knew they had first aid, though I've never been in there, and I knew at worst, we'd find a family bathroom. 

I wanted to put my mind at ease for the rest of the day, so first thing we did was walk into the First Aid station. It was Disney beautiful, clean, and staffed by 2 RNs that were nice as could be. I said, ""Hey I have to take and injectable medication in my ass at 9pm, \*pointing\* he usually gives me my shots and I've never done it on my own. Can we maybe borrow a quiet corner?"" She let me know it was no problem, both of them would be on shift for the entire day, we'd have our own treatment room, and all the time we needed. She even asked if we needed anything refrigerated.

So sure enough, we roll up that night and again, are the only people in the place besides the nurses. All we have to do is sign and print my name, write down the time we came in and they gave us our own HUGE treatment room, with a spot to lay down, sink, alcohol wipes, swabs, everything you could ever need. The shot was done is minutes and we walked out and back out into a super fun night at the parks.

And we got on every ride we intended, some of them twice, and managed to drink a stellar amount of champagne. We got home on the train at 2am, the FET went off without a hitch yesterday afternoon, and our one and only embryo is hopefully doing the thing.

When I was 18, I started TRT for low T. The topic of fertility never really came up (as it didn't concern me at the time.) My doctor would always say that we would cross that road (fertility) when I got there. I've always figured that I could be infertile...so I never got my hopes up about children; feeling somewhat indifferent to having kids. 

Fast forward to today, I'm 8 years married. When me and my wife were dating, I mentioned my TRT issue and potential infertility; she was supportive. After attempting to have kids for the last two years, we finally sat down with a fertility endocrinologist to see where we stand. The doctor went through my medical records and discovered that when I was an toddler I had issues with cryptorchidism (both testes); I had no idea. That combined with a pre-TRT lab test showing very high FSH/LH levels, and drastically low testosterone, pretty much eliminated me being able to father a child. It was blunt. It was direct. 

I think in the back of my mind...I've always felt like I knew I was infertile so I never got my hopes up. I just didn't expect for the closure to hit me like ton of bricks.

I haven't posted much in the last month or so after being benched and part of that is because life has thrown a few curveballs and I'm still processing some of this information while still waiting on answers that are few while speculation is high.

Things started out well as we managed to get that one normal embryo and were starting out a FET cycle. Unfortunately, after adding the estrogen to the mix I got a crazy episode of what I believed amounted to a migraine that included dizziness, lighted feeling, auras in my vision along with floating specks, and a band of pressure across the back of my head. I sought treatment at the ER because I couldn't get in to see a dr. and they ended up preforming an MRI on my head to rule out the possibility of a clot.

Long story short, no clot but they did find something else which was a higher than normal amount of spots of bright white matter and I was referred to a neurologist. When asking what that could mean I was told anything from vasculitis to MS, well that's just dandy...

My RE, upon getting that information, had my cycle promptly canceled until I could see the neurologist and gain clearance to continue, double whoopie because it's not like specialists usually have next day appointments.

I was able to secure an appointment 3 weeks out and just did my best to put things out of my mind and only briefly googled some of the info because I had so little to go on except speculation. I went in on this past Friday and of all the things I made sure to bring or for them to have access to, the last thing I thought to get was any of the results from the tests the RE has preformed because really how can spots on my brain be related to infertility....well I was wrong.

The neurologist was great and walked me through what he saw and got background information and pretty much informed me that the 1-2 a week ""headaches"" I've been having since adolescents where probably actually migraines all along, I'm not a complainer and migraines sounded so much worse to me than what I felt I was having so I never even thought to ask. Of interest was also my lack of temperature regulation in my extremities like hands and feet which are usually cold and my fingers have a tendency to go numb while I sleep. Oh, and an anticoagulant factor that I tested positive for after a RLP was of high importance.

So good news is that the neurologist said it definitely wasn't anything speculated on at the ER but that I could have a condition called Sneddon's syndrome which while being relatively easy to live with, could put me at higher risk of clots, stroke and possibly dementia as I age. You know what else raises the risk of clots? Estrogen. You know what you need to cycle....yup, high doses of estrogen and in that moment the dr. was unable to clear me one way or another to move forward with high doses of estrogen.

In order to confirm things, the neurologist needed some lab results from my RE which he apparently got as of today and there are a couple more I have to go to a lab to have drawn at my availability. I tried to ask the nurse what options there were if I can't be on high doses of estrogen for doing a cycle and basically got a ""let's wait and see"". I usually take that as your options are not good but I don't want to tell you that just yet. :/

So for right now I get to sit here and twiddle my fingers while waiting for labs and a cycle that's likely not happening anytime soon, if at all.

I haven&#39;t posted much in the last month or so after being benched and part of that is because life has thrown a few curveballs and I&#39;m still processing some of this information while still waiting on answers that are few while speculation is high.</p>

<p>Things started out well as we managed to get that one normal embryo and were starting out a FET cycle. Unfortunately, after adding the estrogen to the mix I got a crazy episode of what I believed amounted to a migraine that included dizziness, lighted feeling, auras in my vision along with floating specks, and a band of pressure across the back of my head. I sought treatment at the ER because I couldn&#39;t get in to see a dr. and they ended up preforming an MRI on my head to rule out the possibility of a clot.</p>

<p>Long story short, no clot but they did find something else which was a higher than normal amount of spots of bright white matter and I was referred to a neurologist. When asking what that could mean I was told anything from vasculitis to MS, well that&#39;s just dandy...</p>

<p>My RE, upon getting that information, had my cycle promptly canceled until I could see the neurologist and gain clearance to continue, double whoopie because it&#39;s not like specialists usually have next day appointments.</p>

I asked for more pain meds than ibuprofen or something for anxiety and they said no, that if I come with a full bladder we'll hope for the best and that ""some patients find it quite painful but the majority do not.""

I feel like I'm being a big baby about it all. I've heard so many horror stories though and my anxiety is going theory the roof.

I've been trying for almost two and a half years now. Last June I had a laparoscopy to remove a cyst that was causing me a lot of pain, and I did one round of clomid (50mg) in August. After it didn't work my doctor decided to look into my husband (who's fine, we learned) so I didn't start really seriously trying again until this year. My problem, and all that I basically know so far, is that I have low progesterone and I don't ovulate. In June during my surgery my doctor checked my fallopian tubes and both of them worked fine. So who really knows what the fuck my problem is.

January I took 100mg of Clomid and I felt awful. Lingering headache, exhausted. And while it sucked, it wasn't that bad. No results though, and I didn't ovulate. February I ended up missing because of not being able to get a hold of my doctor, mixed with a period that was almost a week early, so come March she wanted to try Letrozole.

The entire month of March was one of the worst of my entire life. Constant hot flashes, dizziness, unending nausea that ended with vomiting 9/10 times I ate anything. Not to mention the longest, most intense migraine of my fucking life. I'm prone to headaches (cluster migraines and tension headaches, which I was treated for a few years ago) and before trying to conceive I always got a migraine/headache in conjunction with my period, which I had just kind of accepted as part of my life. On the Letrozole though, holy shit. I couldn't drive, I could barely eat and what I did eat I threw up. I could barely function all month, I missed half of my scheduled days at work (not that I work a lot, but still 1-2 days a week giving my shifts away) because I couldn't get out of bed without 2 T3s, which 50% of the time did nothing anyways.

Which still, is barely the worst that happened. I had this weird cognitive thing around my 21st day when I was playing a game with my husband and I suddenly just couldn't think. I forgot the controls, I forgot what I was doing. I could barely talk for almost 2 hours and I felt so mentally fucked. It was terrifying. I didn't drive for over a week after because I could barely concentrate on walking sometimes, let alone handling a fucking car. My breathing got bad towards the end of my cycle too, where I just felt out of breath constantly. Which ended up with my doctor getting back to me on a Friday night (in regards to an email I had sent on Monday of that week, telling her how I felt) telling me that she wanted me to go into emerge and be checked for a lung clot, due to my trouble breathing. She called ahead to the hospital and I walked right into an exam room, which never happens here. I was fine though. Shortness of breath attributed to the migraine.

So. Dr says never take Letrozole again, and that everything stemmed from the intensity of my migraine. Fine. So she says she wants to try Clomid again, this time at 150mg. And that if after three more treatments, if it doesn't work, I need to see a fertility doctor in a larger town , which is about a 10hr drive away. 

The Clomid 150 has made me so fucking depressed. I've never had depression really, until this pill. I hate my very existence. These episodes will come out of nowhere and last hours where all I want to do is sleep. I have a lingering headache, but nothing compared to last month so that at least is a relief. Some dizziness too, and hot flashes, but the worst symptom I'm having is the depression. This pill has absolutely destroyed my mood. I'm miserable and bitchy. And as the month progresses, my cramps get worse and worse. They wake me up at night. Twice last night and three times the night before.

So finally, I ask. Has anyone else had such insane side effects from these drugs? I'm torn, because I don't want to give up after only one cycle on the 150. My next logical step would be IVF which is not covered in the province where I live (BC) and runs about 10k a go.

I don't know what to do anymore. These last few weeks I don't even feel like myself half of the time. But I would rather avoid IVF, if I can. Which makes me think I should try another month on the 150.

Also, don't they give you hormones/drugs while doing IVF? Who's to say I won't feel like shit on those too.

But thank you for reading, if you did. Long rant I'm sorry. But no one in my life understands. I can talk to my husband and he's as supportive as he can be but there's still so much he just doesn't get.

It seems I'm doing that again, huh? I apologise, I know that isn't what this sub is for exactly, but its just nice knowing there are people who relate and understand. 

So, since husband and I have been pretty sick for the past 2 weeks with the flu, we decided to get some junk food as a treat. We drove to the local burger king and went inside. I've never been in there before, so it made me smile to see a huge childrens play area making up the majority of the restaurant. There were kids **everywhere**, all squealing with joy, pushing toy hot wheels on the floor from their childrens meals, one little girl spinning in a sparkly tutu. There were no less than 5 tiny babies around me within reach, one with its tiny little baby socks sliding off...God, It was heartwarming :)

My husband and I have an inside joke that I'm always ""scheming"". Whether its a birthday or Christmas present secret, a random treat or surprise just-because, or anything of the sort, its always greeted with a grin and a ""I knew you were scheming!""

So, when my husband sees me looking at these kids so dreamily, he gives me a little poke and a smile and says I'm scheming. I smiled back and denied it, just said that they were cute and I look at them the same way I would look at a puppy, no big deal. ""Besides, even if I were, its not exactly an option yet."" I don't know why I felt the need to add that. Husband smiled at me saying ""Of course it is, we just need to motivate the troops, that's all!""

I know it was supposed to be comforting, that kids are totally a possibility, we just need to get my ovaries working. I don't know why it had such a negative impact, but the waterworks started completely beyond my control in this big public place. Thankfully, husband was already holding me close, so I just buried my face into his chest and quietly let the tears flow. Our food came not long after and we left, successfully avoiding anyone (even husband) knowing about my mini-breakdown. 

Its past 3am here now and this has been on my mind all day. If I let myself think for even a moment about those teeny tiny socks sliding off those teeny tiny feet, my chest tightens and the tears start. It really hurts sometimes. That's all I really need to express, is that I'm just so hurt. I'm sorry that this isn't a message of positivity or a post that is helpful in any way, but I feel terribly hurt and let down by my own body. 

Ah well...I guess I'll go back to bed and try to sleep (classes in a couple hours are going to be interesting), hopefully this will bother me less now that I've gotten it out of my system. Thank you in advance to anyone who reads my ramblings and uhh...lets end on something positive, eh?

<p>So, since husband and I have been pretty sick for the past 2 weeks with the flu, we decided to get some junk food as a treat. We drove to the local burger king and went inside. I&#39;ve never been in there before, so it made me smile to see a huge childrens play area making up the majority of the restaurant. There were kids <strong>everywhere</strong>, all squealing with joy, pushing toy hot wheels on the floor from their childrens meals, one little girl spinning in a sparkly tutu. There were no less than 5 tiny babies around me within reach, one with its tiny little baby socks sliding off...God, It was heartwarming :)</p>

<p>My husband and I have an inside joke that I&#39;m always &quot;scheming&quot;. Whether its a birthday or Christmas present secret, a random treat or surprise just-because, or anything of the sort, its always greeted with a grin and a &quot;I knew you were scheming!&quot;</p>

Along with many of you I returned fire. I am not ""out"" on social media but I also don't actually use my instagram account so my language was slightly less emotive than others. Under the name HannahRoseSaul. 

Anyway... she has written back to me asking how she could have done better and I am just floored and have no idea how to respond. Can anyone help?

I'd copy and paste the convo but my phone isn't making it easy.

EDIT: does this cover everything? I am trying not to be too emotional as I have the feeling that is not something she responds to (despite her over enthusiastic posts) 

Hi Melissa, 

Thank you for the opportunity to provide some feedback, I am truly glad to see that you are willing to take the issues raised seriously and learn from your mistakes.
I think that reaching out to Resolve is the right choice as they have many years of professional experience.

There were many issues at play here and I think if you reread all of the feedback you recieved and ignore the ""emotion"" you will be able to see what people were trying to say. You most certainly should be celebrating success and it is very sad that this woman's celebration should be tainted by this argument. 

The primary issue at play here is that your responses fail to take responsibility for what you have written. You said that you have intentionally used hyperbole and emotive language to inspire and encourage your followers. I accept that in your profession this is a necessary tool but you have to be aware that this can also have the opposite impact and you have to be ready to deal with that.

The way that you responded to critics on instagram was incredibly petty and amounted to calling them hysterical idiots. But most hurtful was the private meassage you sent to a follower who reached out to you hoping to educate you in this issue so that in the future you would be more aware of what you say. Your response to her ignored all of her opinions. You decided for her what she was feeling and then blamed her for emotions she hadn't actually had. Yes there is stigma attached to infertility, yes infertile couples feel shame. Sometimes it is from people who don't intend to shame them it is just that their words come out that way. It is not something that we choose to feel. To come back and accuse her of jealousy and being unable to feel happy for others by choice is absolutely cruel no matter what your intentions. Would you tell a cancer patient to just be happy with the health they have or a depressed person to just think happy thoughts? 

Infertility is an incredibly complex issue and unlike type II diabetes it is not always diet related. And I sure as hell hope that people referring to MS are talking about slowing progression with diet and not that you claimed to have a cure. It is common sense that healthy diet and nutrition has a positive impact on health and there is absolutely no doubt that fertility is included in that box. It is often addressed by the doctor as part of a LONG term treatment plan. I have not seen any research indicating results in 30 days and I would be interested in seeing any evidence that you have for this claim. There is also no such thing as a one size fits all diet and unfortunately not everybody will benefit from a diet which I think you are very aware of. 

The other thing to consider is the wider impact that your post may have. Tomorrow an infertile couple are going to ""come out"" to mum, grandma, an aunt, their sister, family, friend, colleague. What they want is to discuss their issues, to feel free from the burden of their diagnosis. to experience sympathy. Do you know what they will hear instead? ""I saw something about a miracle diet on instagram the other day""... can you imagine how painful that would be?


Also I have a sneaky suspicion that Melissa has been directed here and will visit. If that is the case welcome, this is our safe space where we can vent and get rid of those nasty jealous feelings we have so that we can function in normal society without upsetting people with our lack of optimism and enthusiasm.

I ask if any chance they&#39;ll let me go for 2 days but I&#39;ll need more meds. She says no. I drive home in tears. Get a phone call. Consultant says try another 2 days. So now I need more meds.

Melissa Hartwig, the founder of Whole 30, has caused me a lot of angst this evening. She posts a pregnancy success story of a Whole 30er on IG featuring such gems as, ""I've heard from so many people who tried and tried and IVF'd to no avail... then Whole30 and BOOM, plus-sign city"" and #fertileAF. Here's the post: https://www.instagram.com/p/BTHZvazhuhk/?taken-by=melissa_hartwig&hl=en
Here's my direct message to her and her direct message back.
.........

Melissa,
I saw your post about Whole 30 getting you pregnant and I’m a little upset. I have been trying to conceive for almost 3 years. That’s 3 years of utter disappointment and heartbreak and invasive, expensive medical interventions.

I did a Whole 30 last March. I’m a healthy weight. I work out regularly. I eat wholesome food. I’m still not pregnant.

Changing the food on your plate does wonderful, life changing things, but it doesn’t get everybody pregnant and it’s not a replacement for infertility treatment.

Your post is another way to make women feel shame for not conceiving, to feel they aren’t worthy, and I cannot accept that. For those of us who aren’t #fertileaf, posts like this are hurtful. Despite the high incidence of infertility (1 in 8 couples), it is an utterly isolating, private pain.

Infertility Awareness Week starts Sunday. If you have a few minutes, perhaps you could take a look at some of the info about infertility etiquette here: http://www.resolve.org/support/for-family--friends/ and consider sharing with your audience?

I love your program and I love your social media but I don’t love how this post made me feel. I could cry to think how it might make others struggling with infertility feel. We’re strong, but damn, it sure is lonely over here.

Waffles

.......

Waffles, I am sorry for your struggles. I can only imagine how hard that must be. But the only way you can see this celebration of another's success as shaming of you (and other infertile women) is if you choose to see it like that. You choose to feel unworthy when you look at this post. I cannot make you feel like that, you are picking that up. Your comment here says nothing of my post (or her success), but says everything about where you are in your own journey....And you don't have to feel like that if you don't want to. I'm so happy to share my Whole30'ers success stories as inspiration and hope for others who are struggling, and I specifically disclaimed that the program is not a fertility treatment. But her joy says nothing about your struggle. The two are wholly unrelated. But if you choose to see this post in a negative light, as suggesting you should be ashamed or unworthy, then you get to keep that story as long as you like. But I sure wish you wouldn't. Because there is nothing to be ashamed of, and your fertility has nothing to do with your value and worth as a beautiful, loved, and loving human being. XO

........

Oh ok I get it, it's me being a bitter bitch. I should be HAPPY that others attribute their successful pregnancies to the Whole 30 and just work on where I am in ""my own journey."" I am literally speechless. Astonished. Am I overreacting? Like, what exactly went wrong here? She's clearly trying to respond with love but she also clearly has no idea.

Saw my RE today for an ultrasound and he says my cervix looks fine on the ultrasound but is at a pretty sharp angle and the radiologist probably just didn't know how to handle it. Recommended I go in next time with a full bladder and ""try to relax."" (Already ""tried to relax"" with 10mg Valium, but whatevs) 

However, he also recommended just two more letrozole cycles (total of 4, I'm responding well & good lining, though he does want to add a trigger to make sure there's no timing issue), and then straight to IVF. He advised against IUIs, said with my cervix/uterus shape the stress wouldn't be worth the tiny (1%) increased chance it would give us. 

So my question is, if we're just two months from looking at IVF, and all we're doing between now and then is letrozole+trigger+TI, do I really need the HSG? Honestly I'd rather lose two months (if hypothetically my tubes are blocked) than go through it again. It's not like we could probably make IVF happen until summer regardless. Isn't a saline sonogram better pre-IVF anyway? Would I get any unique info from the HSG that would change anything at this point? 

EDIT: Here's what my RE just emailed me, but for better or worse I trust y'all more, so still very interested in hearing your experiences / perspectives: 

""If you are intending to move to IVF in the near future, you do not have to repeat the HSG as we do not need to know whether your tubes are open or not. I would do the HSG if you want to try everything possible to avoid IVF."" 

OF COURSE we want to avoid IVF, but being unexplained we haven't really been given any other option at this point that significantly improves our odds over just having sex. So maybe IVF it is. 



",t2_12uj5n,False,,0,False,Anyone not do HSG before IVF?,[],r/infertility,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_66kcf4,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,self,1492723436.0,,[],{},,True,,1492748109.0,text,0,,,text,self.infertility,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Failed my HSG last week (see previous post - radiologist said &quot;looks like you&#39;re cervix is blocked with scar tissue&quot;). Saw my RE today for an ultrasound and he says my cervix looks fine on the ultrasound but is at a pretty sharp angle and the radiologist probably just didn&#39;t know how to handle it. Recommended I go in next time with a full bladder and &quot;try to relax.&quot; (Already &quot;tried to relax&quot; with 10mg Valium, but whatevs) </p>

<p>However, he also recommended just two more letrozole cycles (total of 4, I&#39;m responding well &amp; good lining, though he does want to add a trigger to make sure there&#39;s no timing issue), and then straight to IVF. He advised against IUIs, said with my cervix/uterus shape the stress wouldn&#39;t be worth the tiny (1%) increased chance it would give us. </p>

<p>So my question is, if we&#39;re just two months from looking at IVF, and all we&#39;re doing between now and then is letrozole+trigger+TI, do I really need the HSG? Honestly I&#39;d rather lose two months (if hypothetically my tubes are blocked) than go through it again. It&#39;s not like we could probably make IVF happen until summer regardless. Isn&#39;t a saline sonogram better pre-IVF anyway? Would I get any unique info from the HSG that would change anything at this point? </p>

<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s what my RE just emailed me, but for better or worse I trust y&#39;all more, so still very interested in hearing your experiences / perspectives: </p>

<p>&quot;If you are intending to move to IVF in the near future, you do not have to repeat the HSG as we do not need to know whether your tubes are open or not. I would do the HSG if you want to try everything possible to avoid IVF.&quot; </p>

While my insurance won't cover any infertility treatment or tests that are done in preparation for treatment, it will cover any diagnostic testing. My CD 3 and 21 labs were fine.

We may also consider IUI for a couple of cycles, depending on his next post-wash SA.

My OB didn't think an HSG was necessary until we pursue IVF, at which point the IVF doctor would order it. However, when I explained my insurance limitations, she was happy to order it as a diagnostic test *now* so that it would be covered. It was negative for any issues.

Are there any other tests that you recommend? I see a lot of posts about AFC and endometrial lining issues that were discovered later on. I haven't had any ultrasounds or imaging beyond the HSG.

So... it's been a crazy month. On the 17th, I had laparoscopic surgery to remove my left tube, which was my only remaining tube. This was the result of my 3rd ectopic pregnancy. I lost my right tube in January 2016 to my first ectopic pregnancy.

The loss of this pregnancy and my tube has been pretty traumatic. So many visits to the ER, two injections of methotrexate, 6 ultrasounds, 3 pelvic exams, more blood tests than I can count... and here we are. We did everything we could to avoid this happening. We gave it every available chance to allow it to resolve without another salpingectomy. But, alas, I guess life had other plans.

Anyway, now we're in totally uncharted territory. Obviously I'm still healing from surgery, and can't try for a few months because of the methotrexate anyway. We've got a referral in to the local fertility centre (Ottawa, ON), and we're waiting for a call back for our first appointment. This is all totally mind-numbing. To be tubeless at 27 is a bit shocking for me. I think it still has yet to fully hit me. I got an email from Kindara today and realized that I'll never have need to temp again, and that was a little jarring. 

So, just wanted to introduce myself. I'm 27, self-employed, grad school hopeful, living in Canada with my husband who is 29 and a retired veteran. If anyone has any tips/tricks for navigating Ontario's IVF system/funding, I'd love to hear em. Otherwise, you can probably expect to hear from me in the future. I'll be around.

Thank you. 

Today - CD4: was told all bloodwork and ultrasound came back good. I used to have a large cyst on my right ovary that they were watching, but apparently it went away (yay!). Was given 2.5mg Femara to start today.

Next Monday - CD 10: go in for more bloodwork and ultrasound. I was told that they are looking for 18mm follicle before a trigger. They are shipping the HCG trigger to my place. They said if the US does not show a 18mm follicle, they will repeat US a few days later.

Couple of questions: 
1. Does this timing seem right? 
2. Can someone explain what exact blood labs they are drawing on CD10?

Hello All,     
I'm going to apologize in advance if I'm breaking any of the rules here.  I've tried reading through the FAQs and rules, and I'm not sure if I'm in violation here.  Also, apologies for the throwaway, but people know my main account who I don't necessarily want knowing about this (or some things I reveal below).  Also, I hope I use the correct acronyms and terms.

**Background**     
After 6 months of trying to conceive, I went for my yearly physical and expressed concern to my physician.  He referred me to a urologist who sent me for labs and a semenalysis.  The first semenalysis didn't come back good, but didn't come too bad.  He said IUI would be possible.  I had a count of 20 mil, 18% motility (0 Rapid, 6 Slow, 12 Non-Progressive, 82 Non-Motile), and 0% of sperm with normal morphology. 

The doctor said that there were still sperm so IUI may be possible.  He wanted to send me for a second analysis, lab work, and ultrasound.  The Labwork came back with elevated levels of Prolactin and FSH at 6.  He referred me to a endocrinologist.

The endocrinologist found that while my Prolactin was high, my LH was normal.  We also found my T4 was high,  but T3 and TSH were normal.  She said she wanted a follow up for bloodwork in 3 months (July), but that there weren't any issues affecting my sex hormones.

The Ultrasound came back with a mild varicocele and recommended speaking with a microsurgeon (appointment scheduled for the end of May).

The second Semenalysis came back pretty bad.  Count of 3 million, but improved motility at 30% (0-R, 24-S, 6-NP, and 70-NM), 0% normal morphology. He told me that this test was showing too low of a count for IUI.  I'm sure you can imagine this kind of crushed my wife and I.  He had 0 explanation for the dramatic differences.  My wife was with me for the second one, and she ""assisted"" me with some mild prostate stimulation.  I'm wondering if that skewed the results but when I asked the doctor, he didn't seem to have an answer and wanted to wait 3 months for the follow up.

He did prescribe me Clomid, but did not have high hopes for it working because my FSH was above 4.

In the meantime, I've also scheduled an appointment with a fertility specialist who appears to be very well known and has people travel from out of state to see him (benefit of big city I suppose).  I see him in the middle of June.  I also have a 3rd semenalysis scheduled for early July, which will be 90 days since the Clomid was prescribed.  

**Current Plan**    
I'm not the kind of guy to sit around and just wait for things.  I understand what I'm looking for is a long shot at best.  At worst, I want to make sure I don't do any real damage to myself. I don't know what the worst case scenario is for taking what I'm proposing and that's what I'm looking for. 

I'm also wondering if my wife and I should stop any butt stuff (pegging and the like) because if that could cause any issues in regards to sperm quality.  

What I'm asking is if anyone has any experience with any of this stuff and if I can damage myself further taking all these supplements.  Let's be honest, this is a lot of crap I'm going to start dumping into my already damaged body. I'll also mention, I have no history with drugs or steroid use. I was obese most of my life, but I am now at a very healthy weight and a pretty good athlete (in my opinion, I place well in my age group at different 5ks I do).  I am also 35 years old.

- 38.25 y.o.
- July 2016 results on CD3 - AMH 0.688, FSH 10.1, AFC (5+6) <10mm. 
- At doc's rec, just started DHEA (25mg x3) (GNC), CoQ10 gummies (600mg), and a prenatal w 800 mg folic. Plus Vitamin D3 2000IU a couple times a week. 
- Those tests will be rerun sometime this week on CD3. 

- It will cost approximately $13-26,000 to do 1-2 egg retrieval cycles including $7,000 in drug costs each time. 

- I'm using a reputable clinic in a major metro area but can't help but feel I'm paying a lot for them to advertise on the radio and offer false hope. 
- I'm married but not in a position to use husband's sperm or a donor right now or to be pregnant right now, so freezing eggs instead of embryos. The idea is that this would be an insurance policy in 3-4 years.

Progesterone test on April 8th also indicated that (P4 level was 18) . Pregnancy  Blood Test on April 15 was negative, really upset but was ready for the next cycle. I still din get my period, usually I get period exactly two weeks after I ovulate. I am really worried, on why I still get my period and I had all the AF symptoms in the TWW. 

Does any one have any experience like this before? Can Femara delay period? I also tried accupunture this cycle, do you think it can be because of this. Just trying to understand what went wrong, when my blood work is all good. I called my RE office, they said to wait till next week and see. I still dont know how will I wait for a week and not go crazy :( ...

I am really worried, any advise ?

A follow up staging surgery noted the presence of endometriosis and I had an endometrial biopsy (negative) but I was never given any kind of education about this. Moving out of state and switching doctors, my endometriosis diagnosis slipped between the cracks. A couple years later I had another surgery for a mass on my remaining ovary- also borderline malignant but they were able to leave my ovary. 

I've been dealing with pelvic pain for years and just assumed it was ""normal"" until the intensity and frequency of it really amped up in the last year or so. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for two years with no luck. Letrozole did make me ovulate but I didn't get pregnant after 3 ovulating rounds on it. 

I went back to my doctor a few weeks ago with pelvic and lower back pain complaints believing I may have cyst issues going on again. She ordered a MRI which showed an endometrioma from what I can tell on the report, and a l5-s1 disc issue. 

My follow up appointment with my gyno to go over the MRI is next week.

After my appointment with her when reading over my old medical records is when I discovered mention of endometriosis. I immediately called and talked to her nurse and had her pass that on and faxed the related records mentioning endo to them. My doctor said in a note back to the nurse, endo won't be picked up by MRI necessarily (which I knew) and I expect surgery will be brought up by her in my appointment next week- and I plan to ask about it.

I also saw a spinal doctor about the disc issue discovered and mentioned the endometriosis to him and he thinks my lower back pain could very well be connected to that (shocking for a male non gynecologist doctor to clearly have seen the correlation enough to ask me if it was worse during my period and if I had endometriosis). He is sending me for another MRI of my lumbar spine (waiting on a peer to peer review with my insurance to approve it)

Sorry this sequence is a bit jumbled. My research in the last couple weeks shows some doctors prescribe hormones to ""control"" endo. But the only way to know for sure and actually treat it, is surgery. I've had 5 surgeries- that doesn't concern me and if it will bring me pain relief and possibly help my fertility, I welcome it. I am very much AGAINST hormones for it because birth control gave me awful mental health side effects, and that will be counter productive to trying to conceive. 

My other fear is the endometriosis and it being on my ovary apparently, could mean I may lose that ovary and Bye Bye pregnancy. Egg harvesting is out of the question for us financially. 

I've spent a lot of time on /r/endo but I'm trying to figure out what questions to pose when I see my gyno- specifically related to endo and fertility. At this point, I WANT surgery. For pain relief and the possibility it could help us conceive. I live in a very rural area with no endo specialists for several hours. We are planning to move out of state later this year and where we will be, I will have an endo excision expert half an hour from me.

What questions should I ask? I feel I should instruct her to remove all endo she can, but leave my ovary. And then see an endo specialist who may be more skilled at removing it from my ovary while leaving the remaining ovary I have intact. I need to have this surgery currently because of the pain. I'm missing work. I'm missing out on life. It's debilitating. I realize it could very well just be a temporary fix but if it gives me pain relief from removing whatever endo she can, until I move and can see a specialist, I'm all for it.

My husband's SA resulted a 19milion/ml count, with a 40% motility, and lousy 2% morphology. My RE seemed really unconcerned with this, dismissing it as normal and saying the 2% morph was likely the fault of the lab tech. Meanwhile, over the last five months since we got that result, I've Dr. Google'd the shit out of that SA result, and the internets say that while not the end of the world, it is a lousy result and at least merits some kind of follow up, with most people dealing with those kind of numbers going straight to IVF w/ ICSI. It's been 2.5 years of timed intercourse with nada to show. I also had asked my RE about IUI, which she also dismissed saying, ""it'll just wash away the good sperm"".  She also dismissed anything helping boost his sperm count, saying it's all pseudoscience. 

I finally emailed my RE yesterday and asked - why can't we at least try IUI? Are my husband's counts too low? If so, can we be referred to a urologist? 

She responded that if I would like to try IUI ""that's fine but, women with PCOS don't have any increased benefit from IUI over timed intercourse."" 

Come on lady, are we still operating under the presumption that this is all my body's doing? Am I taking crazy pills? I'm ovulating on my own, and his SA sucked! She did say ""if you would like to do a repeat SA and see the urologist that is up to you"".  I feel defeated, like she doesn't give a shit what I do, after the third cycle of femara fails she's just going to say, ""well, that didn't work. Might wanna scrape up the IVF money."" And that's it. 

This is the same RE who has never checked my FSH because it's ""old science"" and my AMH was all she cared about. I've never had my progesterone checked either. 

I don't have the option of switching RE's because that is the only clinic covered under my health insurance. 

So should I push for IUI, or is this a waste of time?
