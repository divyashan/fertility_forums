I'm so glad I got the first appointment with the RE. She asked about a million questions and did a quick exam to check if there was anything obviously wrong. I could've just hugged her at the end. She actually listened and took me seriously and everything!

Unfortunately, she's almost an hour away so scheduling this second appointment has been a headache. She wants a fasted blood test and an ultrasound to check for thyroid issues and/or PCOS (which means I can't eat anything until 2:00 tomorrow, ugh). I'm just hoping that it's not the wrong time to get these kinds of tests (cycle day 22 now).

While I'm super excited about maybe finally getting some answers, I've had to babysit my (accidental) nephew more than usual and had to go to his baptism so I've been feeling super odd about things, very up and down.

But! Focusing on the positive, hopefully I'll have answers tomorrow!

Well, a few weeks and one RIDICULOUS period later, I go in to see my doctor and what do you know? My progesterone was at freaking 9.0 ng/mL! Holy hell! Last time it was at  .23 ng/mL. Not promising at all.

Guys, I freaking ovulated! *I actually ovulated!* I pretty much danced out of the clinic. Now, obviously I didn't get knocked up or I'd be posting about that. I'm actually wondering about that one, because I had sex with my husband like a maniac all month. It was so carefully timed. And nothing is wrong with my husband's sperm, we know that for a fact. Soooo....I dunno. I guess my body just isn't ready yet. But I thought I'd share this good news with you guys. After a year of being told I was going to have a hard time, being berated into considering adoption and maybe having to look at IVF, I actually fucking ovulated on my own. Maybe for the first time EVER. I'm so excited I could scream!

Anyway, thanks for listening, guys. You have all been so encouraging and lovely, and my heart goes out to each and every one of you.

I know what I've gone through is simply a drop in the ocean compared to what others here have experienced, and that thought is quite staggering to me. I love all of you, and I think about you guys every time I shed a tear over my own fertility problems. 

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words! I'm so glad that you all can share in my optimism right now. However, it was pointed out to me in a comment below that since I didn't get monitored this time around, my follicles may have not actually matured even though the blood work ""confirmed"" ovulation. I guess this shows how new I am to this game. So, now I'm feeling a little string of doubt. If this month's round of Clomid does nothing to get me pregnant, I'm definitely going to question why they haven't been monitoring me via ultrasound.

Hey guys,

We are tentatively, confusedly, on-and-offedly looking into adoption, either in lieu of IVF or as a post-IVF backup. I would really like to be exchanging opinions and support around this process with other current IF people, not just the nuts and bolts of it (which r/adoptiveparents and r/adoption are fine for) but specifically about being in the IF trenches while considering/pursuing adoption.

I know there are a lot of people in r/infertility who *aren't* considering adoption and might not want these discussions here, and anyway this sub is mostly about IF treatments, hence thinking about making a new sub.

But I'm not sure how many people would be interested. Like 3 of us? 10 of us? I seriously change my mind about adoption every 10 minutes, so it's really for people with any kind of passing, fleeting interest in adoption in addition to those who are already firmly on the path.

Husband and I are 29, and have been trying since February 2014, so just 15 months. We tried a month of clomid, and though I ovulated, we didn't get pregnant. But I actually ovulate every month, and have for the past 14 months. I have never been pregnant. 

We live in a state with mandated fertility coverage, and I have great health insurance, so we went to a specialist right at one year. It seemed so strange to me that we could time sex (temping and opks) every month for twelve months and not have even one pregnancy. So we did all of the tests, and discovered that both my tsh and fsh were elevated (fsh was 10.8 one month, 14.1 another month). I started taking synthoid, and my thyroid was right on target just four weeks later. Tubes and uterus looked fine, but I have a low follicle count, just around four on each side. Husband did SA and had normal motility and count, but low morphology, just 3%. The RE did not seem to think that would be a problem. She said they only worry when it's 0% or 1%. 

So she presented us with our options. Clomid plus trigger and IUI, or IVF. The probability of getting pregnant from IVF is obviously much higher than with IUI. But it is also a much more intense experience. Insurance will cover both, so we are very tempted to just jump into IVF in July (the earliest we can start), rather than go through all of the low cost interventions.

I'm nervous we are making the wrong decision. But I am also nervous that we are running out of time with my egg count and elevated fsh. The RE really presented our options as high probability, high cost, vs low probability, low cost. Maybe I'm still slightly in denial that we have infertility problems. 

Any advice?

(5 mins early too) Now as a UK patient you kind of get used to turning up to doctors who haven't even  looked at your name never mind your history so it was a nice surprise when the specialist had already been through all of our notes and test results and had an initial plan. 

So he asked us some more questions to explore the areas of concern, explained all the tests that were OK and the ones that were of concern and we came up with an agreed plan for me to have further tests and to start some medication that he recommended based on a study he is currently involved in. 

So just waiting for a repeat of the day 21 test and a hsg and from there I will potentially be starting some fertility treatment.

Ummm, okay? I confirmed, for the lab work (at least this batch) I don&#39;t have to pay a penny. </p>

<p>Honestly I feel bad, I don&#39;t mind paying for services I received, but mostly I am confused. My professor (I am in a master&#39;s program for healthcare administration) said it must be some sort of capitation agreement, but for the whole bill to get written off? So odd... and I certainly don&#39;t expect it to happen again.</p>

<p>This is the first good thing to happen in a long time for me. I know a lot of us are paying out of pocket and struggle with costs, I hope something good happens to all of us. (And if anyone here works in billing could you tell me wtf?)</p>

Because I was feeling so sick yesterday, I went in to see my specialist (thinking I would need to be admitted to the hospital). She didn't think so and actually ordered an early beta test. I was a little uncomfortable with this because I felt it was too soon and I didn't want to get my hopes up...

Back up a bit, January was BCP due to a cyst.  Then I had a cycle where I think 8 or 9 days of 375IU menopur had no response and the cycle was cancelled, and due to concerns it would take more like a 60 day cycle for things to reset, we started prometrium orally to force and end to the cycle.  But it was also suggested that in this particular case I didn't need a baseline, and since I was so busy for work, I didn't mind.  So when I went in CD7, the 26-something follicle was written off as a cyst...  CD8, I am back in the office having my consult/what next meeting with the RE, and CD9 I come back for more monitoring so they can decide about meds for the weekend.... and it wasn't a cyst. I ovulated and we missed the chance for an IUI.  Next cycle, baseline, two 23 and 24mm cycts, back on the BCP.  Which brings us to this cycle, I'm on CD15 now.  

Baseline was clear, antral follicle count, 3.  Start meds morning of CD4 as CD3 was a Sunday, now we are up to 450IU menopur.  CD6 am, next ultrasound, being cautious, 1 7 (left) and 1 4mm (right).  CD8, find a Kaiser lab in an unfamiliar city open by 7am (yes, I did get the hotel closest to the hospital, not necessarily the cheapest) and then afternoon ultrasound, no change, stay on meds, estrogen is a measly 50.  CD12, and I have 2! 8 (left) and 1 4mm (right).  Meds are immediately cancelled.  However, senior NP has given her input for this scenario, and cycle is maybe not immediately cancelled.

Given the cancelled cycles and benched cycles and the poor response, we are very near the end, that's clear, but there were follicles this cycle and given that the IUI is but a mere $91 after more than $2K worth of meds and $500 in ultrasounds (both our copay amounts), it does feel more like giving it all we've got.

48,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Update on the uro appointment: the doctor is great. Three different major REs in the Chicago area use him as the go-to guy, and he really knows his stuff. He's got an amazing bedside manner (more on that later) and made sure to answer any and all questions we had. It's amazing that Type-A me was still bashful to ask questions that include the words ""ejaculate"", ""testicles"", etc. I think it's because (a) it's not my hardware that I'm discussing, and (b) the guy who's hardware it IS about is sitting right next to me.

While he pointed out that SquirrelBoy does produce sperm, he found no less than three issues that could be a cause--cell phone in the pocket/laptop on the junk, mild varioceles, and previous hernia surgery that may be creating a blockage. Also, now I'm the proud owner of a Google search history that include ""slightly soft testicles"".
I was expecting one main thing he might find, but not three--and that really means at least three because SquirrelBoy is going to have hormone labs done too.

But what scared me shitless was when we were going over SquirrelBoy's previous two SAs (2MM total count in first, too few to count in second) that he immediately and very decisively said that SquirrelBoy needs to make an appointment with our RE to start freezing his sperm, to make sure that we have some when we need it. I hadn't heard of this for MFI before (especially since we're going to have to use ICSI anyways with his counts), and at first it sounded too aggressive. When we asked when he should go in, he said that he needs to go TOMORROW to start providing samples for freezing.

Jesus Christ! What, are his balls going to explode between now and our RE appointment next Wednesday?! What the hell does he think is going to happen??!?! So I'm scared because this is a guy that knows his stuff and for him to say that this needs to be done I think means that he's not confident that SquirrelBoy will be able to produce sperm ""on demand"" as it were.

So I'm reeling--because that sounds aggressive and unnecessary--and the three of us (two Squirrels and a nut doctor, HA!) go up to the nurses station/reception desk to set up SquirrelBoy's future appointments. Between going back for the blood draw, needing him to freeze sperm with the RE, and then go back and give more sperm for another SA with the uro, I became completely overwhelmed. It was all too much.

So then I started to cry.

Once the doctor saw what was happening and knew that I couldn't keep myself from bawling, he put his arm around me and ushered me back into his office to let me cry in private (even thinking about it now is making me sob again). I apologized profusely, and I said that it's not OK for me to cry--this is my husband's appointment, not mine. They both (doctor, SquirrelBoy) told me it was OK and the doctor said to take as much time as I needed. I told him, ""But it's not fair to your other patients for me to make them wait!"" and he said that it's OK, he always runs a little late and they understand. He was amazing. He reminded us that we do have a little sperm to work with, which I'm very grateful for. Then he quietly left the office and closd the door behind him.

After Dr. Idiot's terrible bedside manner (my old OB/GYN), it feels weird to have doctors treating us who act like they really care. I cried for a few more minutes, tried to put on my big girl pants and got it together (giving myself permission to cry again at home, check).

When we came back out to make the appointments, he asked if I was feeling OK. He's not even treating me, and he cares about me!

So I feel awful right now, but I think that we've assembled a great team of professionals to help us. If you're in the Chicago area and need a uro, PM me and I'll get you his name.

Don't worry, I called my nurse about it! She contacted the RE and while I'm waiting to hear back, I wanted to see if anyone has thoughts on this. Also, my RE doesn't do laps and I'm not looking for a second opinion on that right now -- I realize that means I won't know if I actually have endo.

I was briefly pregnant, but had a MC/CP around 6-7 weeks. Got my period, it was heavier and lasted longer than normal, but not really a big deal.

My RE and I both suspect I have some endo on the left side, due to other (much MUCH milder) pain in that area, including pain when they poke around on the left side with the ultrasound wand. But I've never felt anything like this before.

Is it possible the pregnancy somehow took the endo to the next level? I don't even know if that makes medical/scientific sense but maybe someone who knows about endo can tell me.

My wife took an ovulation test this morning (clearblue) she DID NOT check the results.

Went for a mid ultrasound and saw that there is an egg developed. Our IUI is scheduled for two days from now.

We are supposed to take a shot to make her ovulate in about two hours. 

We're going to bed and she remembers the test and there is the big smiley face. We called the hospital and if she is ovulating we need to get the IUI done tomorrow. If she did not ovulate then we need to continue with the plan.

Are clear blue results valid after sitting for 12 hours? It was our last test we can't test again. We're desperate. Please help with advice.

66,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hey all. I've been lurking and posting a little but here's my official introduction. Husband and I (35 and 36, respectively) having been trying for about a year. We just had our first RE appointment today and came away with an ""official"" unexplained infertility diagnosis and presented us with several options for what to do next. Everything was good with me except my lining was thin on day 5 (6mm) so she prescribe Estrace. 

First question: I already have one follicle that is 14mm. Is this normal? She said this suggests I'll likely ovulate in about 4 or 5 days which would be WAY early for me (I usually don't get a positive OPK until day 14-16). When I asked if this meant that I've actually been ovulating earlier than my OPK suggests, she had no idea. Anyone have any insight? I was on clomid last month--could this, and my thin lining be a hold over from that somehow?

Second question: She said because I already have this big follicle to hold off on any other meds but next month offered clomid or letrozole. She seems to lean toward another clomid cycle, though acknowledged that with my thin lining the letrozole might be better. It seemed like the biggest downside of the letrozole was that ~~they would do additional monitoring~~ it is pricier and the fact that it is an ""off label"" (but common) use of the drug. With the lining though, I'm tempted to go straight to the letrozole (plus IUI). Any insights?

She started a new job that she is not overly fond of, and the hours they are working her are just short of torturous. She has very little time to spend with her husband, and even less time to take care of her animals (she has SEVEN dogs and a horse, people!). On top of all that, she is about to have major back surgery this year to help with sciatica that she's been dealing with, and it's going to put her flat on her but for at least 12 weeks. She is feeling really depressed and anxious lately.

So, she texted me out of the blue today with this: ""I need a grand baby to give me something to smile about.""

This was almost definitely just a light-hearted comment that she made in the heat of a stressful day while she daydreamed about me giving her grandkids. Now, I feel like I should add here that I have an older brother, but he's gay and therefore not exactly likely to produce any offspring. Unfortunate for mom, but she's come to accept this fact about her son and is generally more than okay with it. That being said, there's now an added pressure on me to start popping out kids for my mother's sake.

Now, I'm not upset with her. I'm not posting this to bash her or bitch about her. She's a wonderful mother, and I know that nothing she says would ever be intended to hurt me.

I've been tracking my (natural) cycles for about the past 8 months, my luteal phase seems to be about 11 - 12 days which is considered the shorter side of normal. 

We'll probably end up doing IVF due to husband's MFI - the progesterone creams WILL extend the luteal phase, right?? It's just that my body is like a clock - it will always do what it has always done. And I wouldn't want it screwing with any IVF cycle although I suppose the drugs will override my system. Right? God I hope so. I've had bloodwork come back (from 21 days post ovulation) as normal although progesterone was scored as ""34"" (they want post-ov in Australia between 20 and 110) so I guess I produce adequate progesterone despite it never lasting the ideal 14 days. I just want to NOT have a period when we do IVF - and be able to wait for the doctor to call me and tell me if I'm pregnant or not - and not for my period to show up before they call. Sigh. 

Argh. My period started tonight even though I 99% expected it since finding out about husbands sperm count, so I may be a little crazy right now.

I’ve been all shy & lurking around long enough, I thought maybe I should start joining in & introduce myself already. eep! Here goes: I just turned 28 & my person is almost 33. I have PCOS, diagnosed after a few years of weirdness after I stopped bcp.

Right now we’re waiting on more test results before finally getting started with clomid or similar (wasn’t specified yet), testing my blood sugar & doing a semen analysis for him. Which is great! & seems very sensible! Except that was mid-March & we haven’t heard anything back yet. Tuesday will be 6 weeks. I feel like that's a long time for something this basic, right?

I am back after a nice 2 or so month break. Well, I never really left, I was just stalking you all. Of course I had to ovulate during my time off for the first time in years (hooray!) and drive myself crazy hoping we caught it because I wasn't paying attention. Anyway, I had my ""your timed intercourse cycles didn't work"" appt with my RE on Monday. The first thing she spoke to me about was a mini ivf program. She says its low stimulation and half the cost of regular ivf. I qualify for it because I have an ovary load full of eggs (see what I did there?) because I have pcos and don't ovulate naturally. After that she says if I was not in a huge hurry (I'm not, but I would like sooner rather than later), I could do iui. My insurance will only cover 2 actual iuis. I have only done 3 successful ovulating TI cycles so far. My husband is one of those guys that dreads having to go in and jizz in a cup. He would if I ask him, but he complains about it. I get it. It's weird to walk in a room and walk out with a cup full of man gravy and hand it to a gloved stranger. He asked if we could do another TI cycle, so I agreed that's what we will do this month. 

So my question is, after this cycle, should I move on to the IUI? How many of those should I do before having the discussion of whether to do IVF. If this was your situation what would you do next? Would you skip iui and move to ivf? I'm just looking to see what others are/would have are doing/done. 

Thanks everyone!

Before anyone gets their hopes up, it's $25,000 on top of IVF, and is so highly experimental at this point that their first live birth from this process is not even due until August.  

But in any case, I went to a consult with these guys (I wanted a 2nd opinion anyway) and while I was there, I learned a bit more about it.

What they do is take mitochondria from immature eggs and implant them into the matured eggs during IVF. Mitochondria are essentially the cell's power generators, so what this does is give the mature eggs more energy. They theorize that one reason why embryos arrest or otherwise fail to thrive is that cell division takes up a lot of energy, and on their own, they essentially run out gas... but if they can get a boost from new mitochondria, they can keep growing. (I am guessing that the immature eggs haven't used up any energy yet in trying to grow and mature.)

Currently, they use it with women who have had failed IVF attempts.

For little history I had two consistent cysts on my left ovary ever since my first ultrasound back in 2013. At that time they were very small and were not hormonal and after an observation of 3 months on BCP my doctor approved me to go ahead for IUIs. So long story short after my 1st failed IVF in Oct. 2014 I went to Dr. in Feb. this year and they saw a 7.5cm cyst or mass on my left ovary and they asked me to get a Laparoscopy which brings me here to share my experience.

Pre Surgery: I was put on a drug named Aygestin from cycle day 1. I went for a pre-op appointment where they briefed me about the procedure and asked me not to eat anything after midnight since my surgery was at 7:15 in the morning.

Day of Surgery: I was asked to check in at 5:15 AM. After checking in I was asked to change and then the nurse started taking my vitals and they put IV and basically they prepped me for the surgery. My Dr. and all the team members were introduced to me and my SO. Right before they took me to OR they gave me some medicine through to take the edge off and after that everything was a blur till the time I woke up in recovery room. It was a little confusing when I woke up but slowly slowly I gained full consciousness. The nurse asked me how my pain was and then I realized I had the surgery and after some time I realized I was in pain. My Dr. and husband came in to see me the nurse gave some instructions to my DH but I don't remember anything exactly. Once I was given some more pain meds I slept for a while and then nurse gave me water to drink. I was feeling better so she dressed me and asked my DH to bring the car to the out-patient door and some hospital staff dropped me to the front door in a wheel-chair.

Post-Surgery: I was discharged from  the hospital around 2 PM the day of the surgery. That day was tough for me I was in a lot of pain and needed help with everything from getting up to use toilet seat. I was prescribed Vicodin by my Dr. and Ibuprofen we bought over the counter so that I had to take pretty much every couple of hour. Next 2-3 days were difficult but I felt better everyday. I started going to work from 7th of April that is 4 days after surgery. But it was difficult to stay on work the whole day but I managed with medicines and breaks every hour.

I somehow convinced myself during the TWW that this was totally going to work now that the fibroid was out. Well, my period just started and now I feel dumb for being hopeful. 

We have a follow-up appointment with our RE in early May to develop a plan. We have one more cycle of natural attempts before going on femara and metformin. We will do one (maybe 2) cycles of TI with the femara because we are going away in June on vacation, and then 3-4 cycles of IUI with the femara after that. If that doesn't work?

I am 18 months TTC right now, and I am counting my time of being benched, we will get to that. 

After 12 months TTC and and OBGYN not listening to me and just blindly putting me on clomid and metformin and telling me I probably have PCOS (didn't even test me for it). Well it didn't work. So I started seeing an RE. He took me off all of that and actually tested me. I do have elevated total testosterone, my cycles vary from 24 to 40 days, and lots of small cysts on my ovaries, so I do likely have PCOS. After multiple US and an SIS I likely have endometriosis because my left tube is blocked and left ovary seems to be stuck to my uterus. When the RE was trying to insert the instrument through my cervix we also found I have stenosis of my cervix as well from a LEEP i had done when I was 19. My husband also has decent sperm counts but poor motility, surgery won't help him improve motility because his variocele was so small. I also has slightly elevated prolactin (35-55 pre op). I had an exploratory lap and HSG scheduled to clean up and investigate the suspicion for endo for 1/6 this year and the day before found out that the MRI of my head to investigate my pituitary gland and found a tumor. That surgery was canceled which also meant getting to start IUI in february was also out. So I have been benched from getting assistance from my RE until I am cleared from the pituitary issues, but we've been trying anyway hoping for a miracle. 

I found out my tumor was secreting growth hormone, which explains a lot, and does cause infertility. I got to have brain surgery and had this removed on 3/11 and had a ton of complications (CSF leak, Diabetes insepitus, SIADH, low cortisol). I have a full hormonal panel this friday and know that my cortisol levels are finally normalizing. I am no longer producing breast milk so I am guessing prolactin will be normal or close to it!

I had an exploratory lap and HSG scheduled to clean up and investigate the suspicion for endo for 1/6 this year and the day before found out that the MRI of my head to investigate my pituitary gland and found a tumor. That surgery was canceled which also meant getting to start IUI in february was also out. So I have been benched from getting assistance from my RE until I am cleared from the pituitary issues, but we&#39;ve been trying anyway hoping for a miracle. </p>

<p>I found out my tumor was secreting growth hormone, which explains a lot, and does cause infertility. I got to have brain surgery and had this removed on 3/11 and had a ton of complications (CSF leak, Diabetes insepitus, SIADH, low cortisol). I have a full hormonal panel this friday and know that my cortisol levels are finally normalizing. I am no longer producing breast milk so I am guessing prolactin will be normal or close to it!</p>

<p>We are still trying, but I probably can&#39;t go back to my RE until the end of summer for the lap and then IUI. </p>

<p>Hoping for a miracle, this has been the most frustrating thing I have ever been through!!</p>

Dr. W- MFI.  Recommended clomid and IUI.

Dr. D- unexplained.  Maybe egg maturation issues?  Recommended injectables plus IUI.

I went with Dr. D.  I've had some minor issues with his staff and I read about Dr. J who has consistently the highest IVF success rates in my state.  I decided it was worth a consult.  I have one failed IUI and am in the TWW for the second IUI.

Dr. J has strong suspicions for endometriosis based on my menstrual migraines, mild to moderately painful periods, and lack of other possible answers to why we haven't gotten pregnant again.  He recommends laparoscopic surgery to check and cauterize any problems.  He gave me an estimated 50% chance of having endo based on my profile.  

How am I supposed to make an informed decision when all of my information is different??  IVF is a huge investment so part of me agrees that I should turn every stone before doing it.  But then I've also read that a lap is not longer considered gold standard treatment in the US.  So is Dr. J operating under old guidelines?  But then again, he has awesome success rates.

I'm officially making the jump from /r/tryingforababy after lurking here for the past little while.

My husband and I heard last week that his SA results weren't as good as expected - we *still* haven't received the full breakdown yet, but the words 'moderately low' were used by our GP, and we had our first proper appointment at the fertility clinic today. Despite having a probe shoved up my vagina, things went really well and I love our doctor; the one we met last time made me horribly uncomfortable and gave me the collywobbles!! Anyway, the doc said there was nothing wrong with me which is a relief (I had been freaking out for 10 solid days), and we're starting a medicated IUI process as soon as my next period starts, which is in a couple or so weeks. I'm a bit worried about the CD3 ultrasound, but I guess I'll have to get over myself, they're used to the blood and grossness.

My husband has really low sperm count (also waiting to be confirmed with a 2nd SA) and the reality is IVF/ICSI may well be our future.

Now for a long time I've always had cramps at least a full week before my period was due (for 1 to 2 days and then it stops until period starts about a week later). I know this because I noted down all my symptoms while we were trying for a baby the natural way. Cramps just like I get the first day of my period and it confuses me. 

Whenever I google all I can find is women that say it's either ovulation (wrong, i ovulate day 14 or 15 regularly) or implantation cramping (also wrong, I've never been pregnant). 

I'm wondering if my uterus just likes spasmodically cramping as a result of the peak of progesterone or something around that time. But I do have to wonder - if your uterus is cramping can an egg even implant? Because if we have to go through IVF I wouldn't want my cramping-way-too-early uterus to void our chances.

I also spot without fail a few days before my period but the doctors (and I've seen a few) all say that is 'normal'.

Nine months ago, I completed my first (and what will be my only) fresh cycle of IVF. I was one of those annoying people who found this sub when I was starting my cycle, got to know some awesome people for a couple of months, and then I stumbled out of there. I was lucky. It worked. I got pregnant. I got to experience all the first trimester things. I have three stretch marks to show for it. At thirteen weeks, I went in for a diagnostic ultrasound, which I was really looking forward to. Just three weeks earlier we had seen our little proto-would-be-baby wiggling around at our ten-week scan. It was incredible. At twelve weeks, we got the results of our genetics test: all normal. We knew we were having a girl. We had just started letting our guard down because the few people who knew told us we were being too cautious. And so we told a few others. I tentatively started googling riot grrrl onesies. We smiled in the waiting room. And then it was over. 

I don’t remember much of the next week. I intentionally spent most of it in a drugged stupor, used up every spare narcotic I had on hand, and then found some more. One night I washed down some narcotics with alcohol and took a sleeping pill to get to sleep, knowing full well how stupid that was. I didn’t care. My baby was gone.

The hell of infertility is that it’s not quite hell: it’s limbo. But having a miscarriage puts you in a different kind of limbo. My baby was gone. But was it a baby? Was I a parent? Was that wiggling humanesque thing my child? Is it possible to grieve someone you never knew? Something that’s not a someone yet? Who am I missing? Or what am I missing? Am I missing fantasies of a life I had? Or one I’ll never have? It’s like time gets twisted around in this infertility-miscarriage sci-fi quantum landscape: the future is the past, the past is the future, and the present drags on for years.

It seems like most miscarriage stories are the same. Which is why, maybe, this grief is so difficult to process. The individuating part happens after birth – before, everything’s the same. All ultrasounds look the same. All pregnant women talk about the same boring things. Maybe that’s why it hurts so bad for infertile folks to see pregnant bellies—you can so easily imagine that belly being yours. Most pregnancies are the same. Most miscarriages are the same. And maybe that’s why it helps to hear from others who’ve gone through it—my pain is your pain, more or less. A little more pain, a little less pain. But variations on a theme.

Most miscarriage stories are the same. I had it, I lost it, I hurt so bad I thought I’d die. I want to die. But then it hurts a little bit less. And then a little less. And then a little less until you start to wonder if you made it all up. 

I guess I’m writing this because I want to remind myself that I didn’t make it up. Today is April 21st, and today would have been her birthday. I hold her name in a special place, because I’m not sure what she was, or what she is, or what we are to each other. Her name is like a wish you hold in your mind when you’re blowing the candles out. To utter it is to drain it of its magic. And so today, as I’m going in for yet another appointment, and getting yet another ultrasound, and giving myself yet another shot of yet another hormone, I will say her name in my head like an incantation. Or like a birthday wish for someone else.

It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t know anyone over there. I know many of you folks. I had to write something and I wanted to share it. </p>

<p>Nine months ago, I completed my first (and what will be my only) fresh cycle of IVF. I was one of those annoying people who found this sub when I was starting my cycle, got to know some awesome people for a couple of months, and then I stumbled out of there. I was lucky. It worked. I got pregnant. I got to experience all the first trimester things. I have three stretch marks to show for it. At thirteen weeks, I went in for a diagnostic ultrasound, which I was really looking forward to. Just three weeks earlier we had seen our little proto-would-be-baby wiggling around at our ten-week scan. It was incredible. At twelve weeks, we got the results of our genetics test: all normal. We knew we were having a girl. We had just started letting our guard down because the few people who knew told us we were being too cautious. And so we told a few others. I tentatively started googling riot grrrl onesies. We smiled in the waiting room. And then it was over. </p>

<p>I don’t remember much of the next week. I intentionally spent most of it in a drugged stupor, used up every spare narcotic I had on hand, and then found some more. One night I washed down some narcotics with alcohol and took a sleeping pill to get to sleep, knowing full well how stupid that was. I didn’t care. My baby was gone.</p>

<p>The hell of infertility is that it’s not quite hell: it’s limbo. But having a miscarriage puts you in a different kind of limbo. My baby was gone. But was it a baby? Was I a parent? Was that wiggling humanesque thing my child? Is it possible to grieve someone you never knew? Something that’s not a someone yet? Who am I missing? Or what am I missing? Am I missing fantasies of a life I had? Or one I’ll never have? It’s like time gets twisted around in this infertility-miscarriage sci-fi quantum landscape: the future is the past, the past is the future, and the present drags on for years.</p>

<p>It seems like most miscarriage stories are the same. Which is why, maybe, this grief is so difficult to process. The individuating part happens after birth – before, everything’s the same. All ultrasounds look the same. All pregnant women talk about the same boring things. Maybe that’s why it hurts so bad for infertile folks to see pregnant bellies—you can so easily imagine that belly being yours. Most pregnancies are the same. Most miscarriages are the same. And maybe that’s why it helps to hear from others who’ve gone through it—my pain is your pain, more or less. A little more pain, a little less pain. But variations on a theme.</p>

<p>Most miscarriage stories are the same. I had it, I lost it, I hurt so bad I thought I’d die. I want to die. But then it hurts a little bit less. And then a little less. And then a little less until you start to wonder if you made it all up. </p>

171,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Hello there! I wish I didn't have to be here but I am so glad that this amazing community exists. I have primarily been a lurker here and r/tryingforababy for quite some time now (I think I commented on one of the two once) but I realized tonight that now is the time for a formal introduction. I'm ready to dive in. 

Here is our story... In Oct. of this year my husband and will have been together for 10 years, all of my twenties! We have been married for over 2.5 of those 10 years, and those last years have been quite the roller coaster. On December 12th, 2013 my husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer. The next morning we were in the fertility clinic under an emergency appointment to bank sperm. Having children is a huge priority for us and fertility was the first thing that came to my husband's mind when he was diagnosed. Before cancer we had a tentative date of 2015 to start the baby making. Anyways, he had an orchiectomy (removal of a testicle) a couple of weeks later on December 23rd. After Christmas recovering, we learned a few weeks later that the surgery did not cure his cancer and he would need chemo. He banked sperm a few more times, but I should note that all of the banked sperm is of relatively poor quality and can only be used for IVF, likely using ICSI. 

Hubs went through 9 grueling, horrible weeks of chemo that ended almost exactly a year ago. Chemo effected his fertility quite substantially, but we knew that ~70% of men father children after this chemo, so it was possible that in the next couple of years he would likely be ""back to normal/better.""

He slowly recovered over last summer and we were living the high life. We even planned the 2 week trip of a lifetime to Thailand last November to celebrate how far we had come and everything we had been through together. We got back from the trip on a Friday and by Monday my husband had a regular surveillance (every 2 months-CT scan, chest xray, tumor markers, etc.) appointment to make sure the cancer didn't come back. On that Thursday, his oncologist called to say a large tumor was found and he would need surgery. 

Long story short, we were referred to Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC where he had surgery to remove the tumor and 70 other lymph nodes in his abdomen to help prevent future tumors. Luckily, the tumor was a benign teratoma (which was part of his original tumor mix and is still harmful/can spread), however, the surgery (a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection) damaged the nerve responsible for forward ejaculation. So not only did we have the effects of chemo working against us, but now NOTHING COMES OUT AT ALL. We went from at least being able to give trying naturally a fair shot to having that completely taken away from us by cancer. It is possible that this could get better, but it may not, or it may take years (it is impossible to know). Before we knew about this most recent surgery, I was going to go off BC in January and we were going to try at the end of this year. I now went off birth control about 6 weeks ago (I just got my first period too, yay!) and we aren't sure when to try since IVF is most likely the only option. I have *really* grieved this, but I also feel very lucky that we have the opportunity to do IVF and that we banked sperm before chemo. If IVF is how we make our beautiful, healthy baby, then that is how it will be done! 

SO, here is my rant. In the last month or so we have tried to be a little bit more social as my husband is feeling more recovered after surgery. We hung out with some friends that we don't know well but really like a few weeks ago, and pretty soon after they arrived they asked us about whether we want kids. And then they pushed it a little bit. OK, we thought, we are usually open, but its hard to talk about... Harder than talking about cancer. A few days later, I was talking to the woman friend online, and she asked for details... why they couldn't ""just turkey baster me."" It made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I understand. I really, really like her and was willing to explain. I want to be an open book to people I care about, I don't want them to feel weird, even if I do sometimes. WELL... today I commented on another friend's adorable FB post of her baby (a former college roommate, we aren't close in that we aren't involved in each others lives much, but obviously care) and she proceeded to send me a private message... ""i hope i'm not being rude/awkward, but i was wondering if you guys will still be able to have babies. i've been hoping and praying that you guys can, especially with his piercing eyes! i always feel slightly guilty posting pictures of my perfectly healthy babies when i know that there are people who may not able to."" I was so caught off guard that I cried. It is one thing if I offer the information, but it is another thing for someone to flat out ask like this when we aren't extremely close. I feel... hurt? Maybe because I feel like she was asking to fulfill her curiosity? I don't even know. I didn't respond yet and don't know what to say. It is not in my nature to be rude or confrontational, but I just don't know what to say and I feel like she should have known better than to ask something like this. I wish people would just not pry on this subject- it is obviously sensitive. Catch me on an off day and I will cry about it in front of you. If you want that, ask away >:O

Anyways, I am so sorry for the wall of text. I hope that it is ok that I plan to post this in r/tryingforababy too (please let me know if it isn't). Thank you so much to anyone who read this and I hope that at some point I can offer to you some of the support that I see you ladies giving each other. Lots of baby luck and science success to all of you!

It is possible that this could get better, but it may not, or it may take years (it is impossible to know). Before we knew about this most recent surgery, I was going to go off BC in January and we were going to try at the end of this year. I now went off birth control about 6 weeks ago (I just got my first period too, yay!) and we aren&#39;t sure when to try since IVF is most likely the only option. I have <em>really</em> grieved this, but I also feel very lucky that we have the opportunity to do IVF and that we banked sperm before chemo. If IVF is how we make our beautiful, healthy baby, then that is how it will be done! </p>

<p>SO, here is my rant. In the last month or so we have tried to be a little bit more social as my husband is feeling more recovered after surgery. We hung out with some friends that we don&#39;t know well but really like a few weeks ago, and pretty soon after they arrived they asked us about whether we want kids. And then they pushed it a little bit. OK, we thought, we are usually open, but its hard to talk about... Harder than talking about cancer. A few days later, I was talking to the woman friend online, and she asked for details... why they couldn&#39;t &quot;just turkey baster me.&quot; It made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I understand. I really, really like her and was willing to explain. I want to be an open book to people I care about, I don&#39;t want them to feel weird, even if I do sometimes. WELL... today I commented on another friend&#39;s adorable FB post of her baby (a former college roommate, we aren&#39;t close in that we aren&#39;t involved in each others lives much, but obviously care) and she proceeded to send me a private message... &quot;i hope i&#39;m not being rude/awkward, but i was wondering if you guys will still be able to have babies. i&#39;ve been hoping and praying that you guys can, especially with his piercing eyes! i always feel slightly guilty posting pictures of my perfectly healthy babies when i know that there are people who may not able to.&quot; I was so caught off guard that I cried. It is one thing if I offer the information, but it is another thing for someone to flat out ask like this when we aren&#39;t extremely close. I feel... hurt? Maybe because I feel like she was asking to fulfill her curiosity? I don&#39;t even know. I didn&#39;t respond yet and don&#39;t know what to say. It is not in my nature to be rude or confrontational, but I just don&#39;t know what to say and I feel like she should have known better than to ask something like this. I wish people would just not pry on this subject- it is obviously sensitive. Catch me on an off day and I will cry about it in front of you. If you want that, ask away &gt;:O</p>

<p>Anyways, I am so sorry for the wall of text. I hope that it is ok that I plan to post this in <a href=""/r/tryingforababy"">r/tryingforababy</a> too (please let me know if it isn&#39;t). Thank you so much to anyone who read this and I hope that at some point I can offer to you some of the support that I see you ladies giving each other. Lots of baby luck and science success to all of you!</p>

<p><strong>Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH. You are all so wonderful and I am incredibly grateful for your support and advice. I will see you all around (I have a feeling I will be here for quite a while!). Lots of love to all of you!</strong></p>

I have some IVF meds that I no longer need, that I would like to go to a good home.  Thankfully, my insurance paid for a large chunk of this, but I know I’m one of the lucky ones.  Reading here how much women have paid for this is so hard, and I just want to ease the burden for someone.

I feel like I've a somewhat unconventional path to coming here.

I've had irregular periods for most of my life until five years ago. They would vary in length and be late or early. I was so pleased when they became normal. Because of  this normalcy, I've come to appreciate being able to plan around my period and knew what was going on with my body.

That all changed last year. My period began to come less frequently and as I tracked it, I became more concerned. I thought at first it was somewhat stress related, since I'm still a newlywed, but when I had my second three month gap in periods, I booked an appointment with a new gynecologist who is adjusted with one of the better hospitals in our area.

I'm 32 and plus sized, although I am pretty active. She initially blew me off in November and  told me ""come back if your period is still a problem.""
After another month without a period, I made another appointment and saw her in February. I did have a period in January, but the infrequent interval tipped me off.

My doctor suspected PCOS and did blood work and told me to lose weight, which seems to be what many of my doctors tell me to do no matter the health concern. 
When I came back to review the rails with her, she was pretty abashed. I don't have PCOS, but instead a high FSH, indicating that I am showing symptoms of premature menopause.
She redid the testing and my husband came with me to hear the results.

<p>I&#39;m 32 and plus sized, although I am pretty active. She initially blew me off in November and  told me &quot;come back if your period is still a problem.&quot;
After another month without a period, I made another appointment and saw her in February. I did have a period in January, but the infrequent interval tipped me off.</p>

<p>My doctor suspected PCOS and did blood work and told me to lose weight, which seems to be what many of my doctors tell me to do no matter the health concern. 
When I came back to review the rails with her, she was pretty abashed. I don&#39;t have PCOS, but instead a high FSH, indicating that I am showing symptoms of premature menopause.
She redid the testing and my husband came with me to hear the results. </p>

<p>We weren&#39;t planning on trying for a year or two.
Now, we&#39;re reading everything we can and discussing all of the scenarios.
It&#39;s a bit exhausting.</p>

Hi Everyone! For those of you that don't know April 19-25, 2015 is National Infertility Awareness Week. I wanted to share some info with people but didn't find anything that I liked or that covered all I wanted to cover. 

So, I took it upon myself to make an infographic. I understand that it might not be all inclusive and I'm sure I missed a lot of info but I tried my best to cover the basics. 

Please feel free to share if you feel comfortable enough to do so (as I know not everyone is willing to scream from the rooftops about their infertility)

If you are interested, here is a little of my back story...
I have been TTC for nearly 2 years. I was diagnosed early on with PCOS. Hubby got a sperm analysis and everything was perfect on his end. I got in to see a RE fairly early as well due to the PCOS and not ovulating on my own. Anyway, I was pregnant for the first time this past December but it ended up being ectopic and I had to abort.

<p>Hi Everyone! For those of you that don&#39;t know April 19-25, 2015 is National Infertility Awareness Week. I wanted to share some info with people but didn&#39;t find anything that I liked or that covered all I wanted to cover. </p>

<p>So, I took it upon myself to make an infographic. I understand that it might not be all inclusive and I&#39;m sure I missed a lot of info but I tried my best to cover the basics. </p>

<p>Please feel free to share if you feel comfortable enough to do so (as I know not everyone is willing to scream from the rooftops about their infertility)</p>

<p>If you are interested, here is a little of my back story...
I have been TTC for nearly 2 years. I was diagnosed early on with PCOS. Hubby got a sperm analysis and everything was perfect on his end. I got in to see a RE fairly early as well due to the PCOS and not ovulating on my own. Anyway, I was pregnant for the first time this past December but it ended up being ectopic and I had to abort. I am now going into my 20th cycle of TTC. </p>

SO and I (43 and 40 respectively) have been trying to conceive since June 2013 (occurred to me yesterday we've spent almost half our relationship TTC) and started IVF in September last year. We've done three cycles: the first was successful but I miscarried at week 8, second was successful but I miscarried at week 4 (looked like my period, found out it was a miscarriage from the HCG). Third cycle was cancelled before the stim because I had two follicles, one was good and one middling. Specialist (we don't call them RE here in Australia) thought it wasn't worth going through the rest since we'd done so much better in the previous cycles with 6 and 7 follicles.

We're doing IVF wth ICSI due to MFI and the spectre of impending menopause on my part (mum was 42 at menopause, grandma at 40). Miscarriages are likely to have something to do with our age.

* AMH = 0.70 (Should be above 2)
* FSH = 13.6 (Should be under 10)
What this means per my RE + chart = DIMINISHED OVARIAN RESERVE

Per the doc, I basically have ovaries that are 10 years ahead of my actual age (28). 
G.R.E.A.T.... (insert buttfuckton of sarcasm)

So, where do we go? Well... Doc wants to start me on higher doses of pills, I have to do an ultrasound, and an HSG. Hubs needs to get the SA done + some blood work. 

Lots of information was fed to us, and we like our RE. He has a lot of background in the areas we would like to try first:

* HSG 
* Transcervial Tubal Cannualization (TTC) 
* IUI

IVF is not an option at this point, so we are sweeping that under the rug for now. Hubs and I would rather adopt than go the IVF route.

Right now, I want to get all the data that we can to determine if there are any other underlying issues: Semen, blocked tubes, etc (if any et cetering). Until I get this information, I cannot make a clear call on what our future TTC intentions will be. We are also in process of saving for a house, and I am finishing up a degree. 

How I feel: I am not really sure. I am quite calm for one finding out such news. It wasn't what I was completely expecting, but when you've been trying for 4+ years and nothing has come of it, your brain logically starts to think that there is something not quite right. The past year I've learned to deal with the impending feelings of dome I might have to face... and today it worked. So far I've not shed a single tear. For half the meeting all I could think about was eating a damn Togo's sandwich (they're like Subway), since I hardly ate anything at all today being a nervous wreck. Now I am in bed with my furbaby, Jamba Juice, and about to start up an episode of Grey's Anatomy. 

I welcome any advice, support, internet hugs, etc. 

tl;dr: Diagnosed at 28 with diminishing ovarian reserve (DOR); increased FSH + Estrogen. Feeling calm, but know the storm will hit sometime. Ugh. HSG to follow + starting higher doses on pills. Here we go!

<li>Transcervial Tubal Cannualization (TTC) </li>
<li>IUI</li>
</ul>

<p>IVF is not an option at this point, so we are sweeping that under the rug for now. Hubs and I would rather adopt than go the IVF route.</p>

<p>Right now, I want to get all the data that we can to determine if there are any other underlying issues: Semen, blocked tubes, etc (if any et cetering). Until I get this information, I cannot make a clear call on what our future TTC intentions will be. We are also in process of saving for a house, and I am finishing up a degree. </p>

<p>How I feel: I am not really sure. I am quite calm for one finding out such news. It wasn&#39;t what I was completely expecting, but when you&#39;ve been trying for 4+ years and nothing has come of it, your brain logically starts to think that there is something not quite right. The past year I&#39;ve learned to deal with the impending feelings of dome I might have to face... and today it worked. So far I&#39;ve not shed a single tear. For half the meeting all I could think about was eating a damn Togo&#39;s sandwich (they&#39;re like Subway), since I hardly ate anything at all today being a nervous wreck. Now I am in bed with my furbaby, Jamba Juice, and about to start up an episode of Grey&#39;s Anatomy. </p>

<p>I welcome any advice, support, internet hugs, etc. </p>

<p>tl;dr: Diagnosed at 28 with diminishing ovarian reserve (DOR); increased FSH + Estrogen. Feeling calm, but know the storm will hit sometime. Ugh. HSG to follow + starting higher doses on pills. Here we go!</p>

Yesterday I had an appointment with my specialist. Turns out I have PCOS, but not too severely. Apparently my androgens aren't overly high, but I do have more follicles than I should? He said that normally he could prescribe Clomid, but there's no point because I'm not the only issue. 
 

My husband has a low sperm count. 1 million only. Apparently this is almost low enough that we would need a sperm donar, but until we get more tests (motility and morphology) we won't know. He said IVF is our only option.


I'm gutted. We always knew I would have issues, but not him. All we ever hear is how fertile his whole family is. They all got pregnant first time. His mum constantly talks about how careful we have to be because of it. He feels like he has let everyone down. But he was also asking why we can't at least try Clomid.

My hysteroscopy went well last week, and my RE wanted to take advantage of a cleaned up lining.  I started microdose Lupron on Wednesday and my stims (Menopur and Follistim) last night.  I’m also taking Omnitrope for egg quality.

I have some hope that this different protocol will work better for me than the previous antagonist ones.  My lining is good.  I had lots of follicles at my first ultrasound.

But the hope is limited.  I’m 38. I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS, hyperplasia, and hypothyroidism.   And we still don’t really know what went wrong before.  We had poor fertilization rates (even with ICSI), poor embryo growth, and no blastocysts. We transferred two morulae each time, none of which ever implanted.

But whatever happens, this is our last IVF. One last try.  And there will be no hoping for a surprise pregnancy—I will permanently be on hormonal birth control to prevent a hyperplasia relapse. 

Infertility has taken over my life for the last 4 years.  It’s time to take it back. To reclaim the happy and confident person I used to be. I was too devastated after the last failure.  I can’t live with this stress and anxiety any longer, especially when there’s no guarantee that we will ever have success.  It’s taking too much of a toll on my physical and mental health.  My emotional health.  My career.  My friendships. Our finances.  Everything.  We’ve reached the point in the journey where the pain of moving on seems preferable to the pain of staying in limbo.

And so this will be my final IVF, my final stims and retrieval. I’m hoping it brings success, but I will settle for closure. We will do FETs if that is an option. But we’ve decided not to pursue donor eggs.  There are too many reasons I’m not comfortable with that path and I’m at peace with the decision.  The adoption question is still looming.  We’ve attended an orientation and done some reading and a lot of talking, and we’ve decided that we’re not ready to decide yet. That will come later, though I suspect it will be difficult to commit ourselves to such a daunting process.

Thank you, /r/infertility, for being such an amazing place of support and care.  This journey would have been so much harder without you.  And while I’ll definitely be around for this cycle, if we end up with a final failure I may need to take a step back from this wonderful corner of the internet so I can grieve and try to move forward.  I’m scared of the potential devastation.  But deep down in my gut, it feels like the right time to stop.

Now—how do I get through the next few weeks without losing my mind?

220,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Update at the bottom. 

Hello all!  I am having a situation with a friend and would love your understanding selves to give me some advice.  I'm not sure who else I can talk to about this subject who will really understand.  It's a little long, but please stick with me.  

I have a friend I have known since my first year of college.  She was a wonderful friend for a very long time, my best friend actually, and helped me through a lot of shit.  Two and a half years ago she got married and immediately had two kids (one of whom is my Goddaughter).  Over these past few years her attitude has changed immensely.  She has become exceedingly judgemental, especially when it comes to the subject of parenting (she went so far as to shame my sister-in-law for not breastfeeding even though she was unable to produce enough and she was emotionally exhausted). 

She is also very religious and isn't afraid to hide her beliefs on many subjects.  One such rant was about how using any ""unnatural"" means to get pregnant is evil (yes, she specifically used the word evil). She also frequently states that she ""can't understand why people don't just adopt"" because she is adopted. She even went on a rant about how surrogacy is also evil because the child ends up with the DNA makings of three people. That Facebook post came when we had been trying for a while already and it just really stung. Since then, I have not reached out to make contact even though our last conversation included wanting to make plans for me to come see them. (on a side note, I've noticed it always seems to be me driving 45 min to them and always seems to end in me babysitting)

I have since received multiple messages from her via Facebook and text.  The first was very accusatory, stating she was angry and there was no way her kids would recognize me etc.  The second was a little more subdued stating they had sold their house and she hopes to hear from me.  I have not yet responded. 

I have not told her much about our struggles with infertility.  She knows it's an issue, but I don't think she knows how it is affecting me.  She also doesn't know we are starting the process to adopt through the foster care system. I also know that both of her children were conceived immediately and she will not understand the emotional impact infertility can have on a person.  I had been hanging in there because of my Goddaughter, but I really don't know if it's worth it anymore.  I'm not sure if I can take the emotional tole this relationship may have  on me on top of everything else.  And even if we do work things out, I'm not sure if I can ever talk to her about what we will be doing to TTC without fear of being immensely judged. I'm also not sure how to respond to her rationally without spewing lots of anger.  

Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Edit: Thank you all so so much for your support.  This post helped me get the courage to reply. I have anxiety and typically hate confrontation, especially with things this sensitive and emotionally charged.  I sent her the following, which is directly based off of some of your replies, so thank you! 

""We are struggling with infertility and are looking into treatment options. This is extremely difficult, but also extremely important to me, and I feel like you don't approve and will tell me my choices are evil based on some of your Facebook posts. Your judgement about alternate routes to parenthood is personally painful to me.  Please remember that you're judging others for struggles that you yourself have not personally experienced.""

Now I wait... 

Edit 2:  This is the response I received... 

""I would never judge you for a choice you would make with your own family and body.  I may disagree, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't still love and support you and your potential family... I would have hoped you'd know me well enough to know that.  Been praying for you and Darin, and will continue to do so.""

So pretty much, at least to me, this says ""this is your fault, not mine.  I'm not sorry."" I guess I have my answer.  I'm not even sure this warrants a reply.  Sigh. Sometimes people really suck...

The doctor I was told to see is not actually an RE but just an OB/GYN.  Eh, not an issue.  It's not that I don't like my current OB, but I felt WAY more comfortable from the get-go with this one.  He put me at ease immediately.  He looked over my charts from my RE and then we explained in detail my surgery (since stupid hospital didn't get us the records in time).  Then he starts throwing around words like *endometriosis, stage 4*.  **Stage 4?!**  What the crap.  And actually, that wasn't even the biggest shocker.  Saying I had endo was.  You see, my RE blatantly told me that what I have is not endo, at all.  No chance.  At all.  (That's where the miff comes in.)  New doc said he obviously can't confirm without taking a sample and sending it to a pathologist, but from what my charts indicate and how I described all the adhesions from my surgery, he's almost positive it is.  

He then proceeded to call me unique.  Ha!  Because I knew I wasn't normal.  I didn't take it negatively.  It actually made me giggle a bit.  I brought up my RE's suggestion to do esure (sp?) implants to seal off my tubes since they couldn't remove them.  I told him my apprehension to that.  He explained it in much more detail than my RE which makes me 1) like him more and 2) even more reluctant to do it.  He even said that while it can provide a greater chance of IVF success, he doesn't like the idea of a coil sticking out into my uterus with a baby growing.  I kind of agree here.  

I asked him what clinic he would refer me to (since he's not an RE), and he mentioned where I am now, but a different doctor.  Which I'll be honest, mine is kind arrogant and I'd rather not go back.  He also mentioned one in SC (about 6-7 hours away) that has good success and is MUCH cheaper.  We may actually look into that.

So where are we now?  Well, he wants to see images of my surgery before making any decisions.  But for me, I totally love him and felt super comfortable with him so I may stick around there.  Now to track down those damn images.  He did say that with everything that I described, IVF is my only option...which isn't news to me.  

So that's that.

234,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f2244aead90>,,infertility,"Last year, I asked if anyone had any information about double-coverage for health insurance (secondary insurance).  It didn't seem like anyone had any information, so I wanted to check in, in case my experience helps someone else.  

As background, my state requires infertility coverage, but my employer falls in one of the loopholes, so doesn’t have to provide it!  Last year my husband and I spent just over $20k on one failed fresh and one failed frozen cycles.

So I wanted to check into whether I could purchase coverage that did cover infertility, in addition to the insurance that was provided through my work.  No one really knew if I could, or what the process was, so I probably spent 15+ hours on the phone with dozens of different people.  Here’s what I learned:

•	You can be double covered.  The catch is that you’re not eligible for any premium subsidies (ie, you have to pay the entire premium yourself- the federal government won’t help you)

•	Make sure your RE is a covered physician/the office is a covered office for the plan you’re considering!

•	Plan ahead.  The open enrollment period runs from November until February (I think).  Other than some other extenuating circumstances, that’s the only chance you have to sign up!

•	Confirm several times that the coverage is for infertility treatment, and not just diagnosis!  Ask the insurance company to run some infertility treatment codes to make sure they’re covered before deciding on a plan.

•	Check out the premium prices v. coverage.  For example, I pay just over $300/month for a gold plan with a $500 deductible and a $3800 yearly out of pocket max.  So I’ll pay the first $500, then 20% of all costs up to a maximum of $3800.  So the most I’ll pay this year, no matter how many procedures we do, is $7400 (the OOP + premium costs).  If I’d paid less in premiums, the OOP would be correspondingly higher, and might lead to a higher end cost.  

•	See if your employer offers a flex spending plan to save pre-tax money that can be used for medical expenses.  You can’t use it for paying premiums, but you can use it for the deductible/OOP.  

•	As soon as you get your new insurance card, get in touch with your RE’s office and ask the billing coordinator to double-check the coverage it includes.  You have one month (or at least I did, with BCBS) to decide you don’t want the coverage.

•	Be completely honest.  It’ll ask on the forms if you have other insurance.  Be sure you fill in the information it asks for.  If you don’t, that can be grounds for denying your claims. 

•	Call the insurance company if you have ANY questions.  And if the person you’re talking to can’t answer them, ask for someone else who might be able to. 

•	The billing coordinator at my RE’s office told me that she’s been doing this for ten years, and has never seen a private (non-employer) plan offer infertility coverage.  Well, thanks Obama!  Check out both healthcare.gov and your corresponding state exchange (if available).

•	Make sure you have the first month’s premium PAID before it’s due.  Not just in the mail- actually paid and applied to your account.  One of the quirks of the ACA is that they have to cancel the plan if the first month’s premium is late.  

I’m getting ready to start a fresh cycle, and so far things are going well (preauthorization is accepted, meds are ordered).  I’ll update this if I have any further information or problems, but I sure hope this is helpful for others in a similar situation!

I'll give you my story, and you can tell me if this is the right spot for me.  I read some posts and the sidebar but I didn't see anything about my particular situation.

Due to a lot of very, very bad health problems in my late teens/early 20s, I had to make a choice at 22.  I could continue on the path I was and be sick/unable to work/unable to go to school/get blood transfusions and intravenous iron every few months, maybe forever.. Or I could get endometrial ablation surgery.
The doctors were reluctant to do it at my age.  I was so, so tired of being sick that I would have done just about anything to get better.  Any pregnancy after ablation surgery would likely be ectopic or immediately miscarry, so they also inserted essure coils during the surgery.

So my infertility was my choice.  And I feel incredibly guilty and inadequate about it.

At 22, I never imagined I'd ever be at the point where I would desperately want to have a child of my own, but here I am.  I'm in love, and we haven't been together long enough to actually start planning kids, but I know we will in the near(ish) future.

My boyfriend knows.  It's something I've always brought up early-ish in a relationship (like when we start having sex) because I understand it's a big deal.

Here's the thing, though.  I was at the doctor recently, and we concluded that the lining of my uterus has grown back.  As it stands, the issues I had when I was younger have NOT returned, so there's no need to do the surgery again at this point.

I asked the doctor if this means I might be able to safely carry a child, and I was told that if an ultrasound confirms that my lining is thick enough, I can, probably.

This doesn't eliminate the obstacle of the Essure.  I can't get pregnant.  We will have to have enough money to try IVF or hire a gestational surrogate.

Basically, I don't know if I belong here.  I do know that I want more than anything to have a baby of my own, and it isn't possible.  I am so happy for my friends who have babies but so angry at myself that I made it impossible to have any.

<p>Thanks for your input!</p>
