I am holding onto that hope because of the cousins.

I don't really post here very often (maybe just to toss out a quick rant), and I feel like I ask for help/advice far more than I hand out encouragement. For that, I apologize. I have gotten so much love good vibes from this community, and I want to personally thank all of you who have taken the time to reply to my posts or just read my thoughts. You guys rock!\n\nWith that, I wanted to give a little update on what's going on with me, just because I'm feeling really excited and optimistic. So, since my PCOS diagnosis I've felt...well...crushed, for lack of a better word. We've all been there. It sucks. I feel lost in a sea of acronyms, blood work, follicle checks, and anovulatory cycles (last one was almost 80 days, wtf?!). I guess I was avoiding that RE referral because I wanted to postpone that next big step. I was scared. I still am scared. But I'm more scared of giving up, because I know the consequences of that. So, I finally did it. I got my referral. AND, as a bonus, I got my OB/GYN to listen to me. He started me on metformin, which is awesome (and yet my stomach is saying it's not so awesome). So, here I am, waiting for my RE appointment so I can see just where this goes from here. I'm nervous, excited, scared, angry, and every other emotion that could possibly be associated with this moment in my life, but there ya have it.\n\nSo, I guess my number one question right now would be: How do you guys handle the stomach upset with metformin? Does it go away? I know diet change is going to be the main thing, and I'm definitely working on that part. I've heard that the timed release capsule is easier on your digestive system, but when I mentioned it my doc seemed very reluctant.\n\nAnother question: what should I be expecting at my RE appointment? Just a general \"this is what's up and this is our plan of action\"? or will it just be more testing? I've only had one HSG done in the past year, but no saline sonogram or anything like that. I just want to be prepared for what's going to be shoved up my vagina. I don't like to be blindsided by those sorts of things lol. \n\nAnyhow, thanks for reading if you got this far. Hope everyone is having a beautiful day, and I'm sending out good vibes/prayers/thoughts/whatever you need in this moment to feel encouraged.

I just wasn't that into comedy news and I don't jump in bandwagons. Now I'm interested in him. His understanding and comments on suffering, pain and loss are amazing. \"People's suffering is sacred\" and \"you have to learn to love the bomb\" (speaking of the bomb that was the plane his father and brothers were on that killed them). And my new favorite to think on, a quote from Tolkien to a priest \"what punishments of God are not gifts?\"\nI'm religious and for me that's deep and something I want to think on more. The context for that quote he goes into better near the end of the article stating:\n\n\"I [article author] asked him [Colbert] if he could help me understand that better, and he described a letter from Tolkien in response to a priest who had questioned whether Tolkien\u2019s mythos was sufficiently doctrinaire, since it treated death not as a punishment for the sin of the fall but as a gift. \u201cTolkien says, in a letter back: \u2018What punishments of God are not gifts?\u2019 \u201d Colbert knocked his knuckles on the table. \u201c \u2018What punishments of God are not gifts?\u2019 \u201d he said again. His eyes were filled with tears. \u201cSo it would be ungrateful not to take everything with gratitude. It doesn\u2019t mean you want it. I can hold both of those ideas in my head.\u201d\n\n\nThat's powerful for me. No one wants infertility and pain, but I think we can accept it in a way and deal with it in a way that's better for us I think. I wanted to share this with yall because I know we deal with a gaping wound everyday and have all experienced loss and grief and pain. We all have to figure out how we deal with and live with this. I want to not become bitter like how Stephens mom didn't get bitter despite her sorrow. I want to learn to still have joy and to love the cause of my pain as he learned to. I know not every one will agree or take anything from this, but in case anyone else does here it is. It's a great read and is giving me a lot to think about today.

I know it doesn't seem like long compared to some of the stories I've read here (and my heart goes out to you), but it seems long for us.  We had no idea what to expect coming into this.  All we knew was that she was 23, in good health, never had any issues or irregularities with her health, body, etc.  She wanted a baby.  Her own baby.  I wanted it for her.  We expected it to be easy.  We expected it to be quick.  23, healthy, and regular...what could go wrong?  The doctor took some bloodwork...everything looked perfect with the exception of her prolactin level (which they got under control that month).  After IUI 1 failing, we were a bit taken back.  We did some research and we found that it isn't always as easy as we thought.  So we sucked it up, and we tried again.  Failed.  Ok...odds are starting to look more in our favor now...Tried a third time.  Failed.  We decided to get more aggressive, she tried clomid, she tried follistem, she tried natural IUI...failed.  After every medicated cycle, she developed cysts that would take 1-3 months to disappear.  But we kept trying.  Every time, the doctor told us she responded beautifully to the medication.  For some reason...she just wasn't getting pregnant.  \n\nSo, 5 failed IUI trials and exactly one year later...we took a break.  We talked about everything we were feeling, and where we wanted to go next.  She said IVF.  I said okay.  \n\nFast forward to now.  She got baseline tests done.  All her blood work came back.  The doctor calls and leaves her a vm. \n\"We got your blood work back today, and we need you to come in as soon as possible to discuss the results.  We found your hormone levels to be a little odd, and it seems that you have an extremely low egg reserve\" ::Hangs up::\n\nWhat does that even mean?!  \n\nSo, we went in and talked to the doctor...this morning.  He showed us her results.  Back in September of 2014, her AMH levels were 1.8 (he said they expected it to be 1.5 or above).  Today, they are 0.32.  Her FSH...14.2 (he said it should be 10 or lower).  \n\nHow....on....earth....does a healthy 23 year old woman have that drastic of a change?! Seriously.  How does that happen?  In a year?!  Come on!\n\nHe kept saying it was genetic.  But...they are testing her hormone levels...after being on crazy medications for a year that will affect her hormones.  They are tested ovarian stimulation and egg production....when they know she has cysts right now that are hindering it.  Yet, he says this has nothing to do with her results.  Am I wrong?  I understand it's quite possible for me to be wrong, i hardly know anything about this.  But it SEEMS so simple.  I don't know.\n\nAlso - there's no way our doctor would be doing anything....sketchy? Right?  I mean...even though we purchased 5 vials up front, and told him if those 5 didnt work we were going to do IVF....he wouldn't ... mess up just to get more money out of us? Right?\n\nI just don't know what to do.  My wife doesn't know what to do.  We just feel defeated and frustrated and angry and even a bit stupid right now.\n\nIt just doesn't seem right.  SOMETHING has to be wrong.  Or am I still holding on to hope?  Help.\n\nOh, and...our doctor told us that the medications were going to be near 10,000...and that doesn't include the procedures.  I just don't know anymore.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Desperate for answers...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3hlab1/desperate_for_answers/"}, {"author": "squirrelgirl22", "author_created_utc": 1357510535, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Severe MFI for him / Lean PCOS for me", "author_fullname": "t2_a4kpo", "created_utc": 1440007144, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3hm1va/apparently_we_have_late_bloomers/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3hm1va", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3hm1va/apparently_we_have_late_bloomers/", "retrieved_on": 1440537790, "score": 24, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "GUYS!

However, I did learned that I have an AMH of 10.8. This was exciting at first, but then after extensive Googling (damnit), I realized that this is likely abnormally high. I also had a Day 3 baseline ultrasound last week that showed an antrical follicle count of 26; 14 on one ovary, 12 on the other. As someone who is desperate for answers, I have been thinking a lot about the potential of my having PCOS. The clinic nurse said that this doesn't seem likely, given my \"normal\" hormone and A1C levels. I have always had normal cycles in which I ovulate every time, but then again I had been on the pill since I was 17 years old as of this past November. I have also always had acne since I was a teen, along with some dark hair below my belly button. \n\nWe have a follow-up appointment with our RE on Monday morning to discuss all of the testing and figure out where to go from here. Our nurse had indicated that our RE may suggest trying an IUI. What are the advantages of this for someone who seems to fall pregnant without issue, but never develops a fetus and ultimately loses the pregnancy? Any experience with lean PCOS?

These females are genetically prone and usually they have a very strong family history of diabetes. Polycystic Ovary is just another variation of the ovary. Sometimes it may not cause any symptom at all but it may lead to infertility that is due to an ovulation. There are thin PCOS also but the females who are obese, they tend to have more problems. There is a problem of acne and hirsutism. They may have certain black spots also in the neck that are called acanthosis nigricans.\n\nIn these patients who are suffering from irregular periods they usually have an ovulatory cycles. They may have periods ranging from regular (28-30 days) to 2- 3 months or may have amenorrhea for a very long time. So in these females it is easy to treat the infertility if it is only due to an ovulation. Then they are also very prone to have abortions or gestational diabetes during the pregnancy.

I'm just having a really hard week. I've had problems (PCOS, cysts, amenorrhoea, unexplained terrible bleeding episodes, etc) since I was 10, so I was expecting having trouble trying to conceive but I guess I never realized how hard it would be. I'm currently trying my last round of Clomid before my doc says we move on to something else. After all the other months with no ovulation, I'm not hopeful and just kind of view it as a necessary last ditch effort just to say we tried. \n\nRecently, one of my best friends confided in me that she was having trouble getting pregnant. When she told me she wanted to talk to me about it, I felt weirdly relieved that I'm not alone. I hadn't even known they were trying. When she was telling me what was going on with her, I kept thinking that these 'problems' didn't really seem like problems, but I was shutting those thoughts down, saying it's not fair for me to dismiss her problems just because I'm comparing them to mine, and focused on being supportive and giving her the responses I've always wished to get when someone talks to me about my struggles.\n\nWell, last night we went out to dinner and I asked her how it was going and... you guessed it... she's pregnant. It was like their 3rd month of trying. No interventions required at all. It's still really early but definitely pregnant. I'm happy for her but I'm also totally crushed. When I told my husband he looked like someone punched him in the gut. It just gets harder every month that passes.\n\nAlso, I feel like a bad person for even feeling this way, but I'm also sort of upset with my friend. Even though I'm sure the things she was interpreting as problems seemed very real to her at the time, I just also feel like it was so shitty to talk to me about it like we were on the same page when now it's clear we weren't. Not that she could have known she would get pregnant right away, but to assume you have problems when you don't.... I don't know, it just sucks. \n\nMy dad also got engaged this week which has also been complicated for me emotionally (the Clomid mood swings aren't helping!) and now he wants to plan a destination wedding and I'm in that whole dance of thinking well, that month could be hard because if I got pregnant this month, I wouldn't be able to travel...... but I also know I probably won't be pregnant this month so I feel silly for even thinking it.\n\nI don't know. I just feel like everyone around me has the big, happy things going on in their life and me and my husband are just left behind. Thanks for listening.

I'm in overall good health, have a wonderful husband, a stable home, a supportive boss, and a good job. \n\nThat said, my first IVF visit threw me for a real loop. I let my hopes get up, and this topic makes me emotionally raw to begin with, so it was a bad combo. I'm having some trouble processing things. I feel like I need help. A rundown of the day I spent:\n\n- I got pulled over and yelled at by the police for rolling a stop sign in the medical plaza in a city where I'd never been - my city doesn't offer IVF so we had to travel quite a ways. I was so nervous, lost, and simply hadn't seen the sign. The yelling got me to the edge of tears, the upset feeling never left me, and of course I burst into tears later while talking with the doctor. \n\n- Discussion of starting IVF (soon! yay!) quickly turned to talk of surgery when an ultrasound revealed my fibroid is growing (currently up to 6.5 cm), fills most of my uterus, is entwined with the ligament supporting the uterus, and could cause pregnancy complications. I was referred to a surgeon. \n\n- After a painful exam by the surgeon, I was processed and scheduled for surgery in three weeks.\n\n- I learned that this surgery means automatic C section delivery if I ever do get pregnant. I got home and started fretting about the surgery. It took my by surprise and I wasn't prepared with research or questions to ask. It is elective and there was no discussion of its risks, especially for future pregnancy and delivery. I'm now worried about whether I'm making the safest and best decision. The doctor\u2019s office won't answer my questions over the phone and told me to ask at pre-op, which to me sounds really late to be making decisions to cancel.\n\n- This new RE put me on a low-glycemic diet, starting immediately and lasting until a baby is born. I am a healthy athlete with great blood sugar and BMI; this diet is simply related to fertility research my doctor referenced. I am willing to do whatever it takes and I will, but this was another blow to morale because she specifically banned foods that are near daily staples for me: cereal, bananas, watermelon, pineapple, and bread. It also makes me worry that my past fruit-heavy diet has related to our infertility.\n\n- My exercise got restricted to four LIGHT hours per week. Exercise literally keeps me sane and is the core of my social life and de-stressing. Again, I will follow doctor\u2019s orders and do whatever it takes, but this was also tough for morale. \n\n- After a few sleepless nights, fretful days and a couple breakdowns, I decided to seek counseling. I tried on two separate days, but I couldn't make it far enough through the intake questions over the phone to get an appointment. I have trouble opening up to people, and I feel crazy enough trying to put this into words, and I have minimal experience with counseling, so it's tough trying to spill my deepest issues to a stranger on the phone in a call being recorded for quality purposes. \n\n- I have since tried contacting my home doctor\u2019s office for advice, but they are busy and I haven't heard back. \n\nThat's where I'm at. Please, someone remind me that all this isn't the end of the world, my overall life is great, people have a lot of worse problems, and I will get through this. I'm very much closeted about my fertility issues, and this is one of the only places I feel I can share. Thanks for listening.

I'm the husband so this will all be from my perspective. I'll refer to my wife as 'W' for the sake of anonymity.\n--------------------------\nThis all began in very early January of 2014. My wife ('W') had discovered that she was pregnant the month before. She emerged from the bathroom one evening quite distressed, concerned about blood and tissue she had passed. We rushed to the emergency department were she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. No procedure was performed and no medication was prescribed. She followed up with her OB to track her [hCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin) levels down to zero. Almost immediately following this, we relocated 600 miles away for my new job. W needed to find a new OB and to continue monitoring her levels.\n\nFor four months W was spotting and her hCG levels were trending very very slowly. W was quite distressed since each day she discovered spotting was another reminder of the terrible event she had just endured and was left wondering when it would end. Her OB recommended waiting since her hCG levels had reached zero (finally). The ultrasounds however were not helpful, since they seemed to indicate the presence of something, which was diagnosed as a cyst (another scare for W).\n\nAfter a few weeks of still spotting, frustrated, W sought the opinion of a new OB. This OB performed another ultrasound at which point blood was discovered in her abdomen. She was immediately rushed to the emergency department to undergo a laparoscopic procedure to diagnose the problem. Once underway, it was immediately clear to the OB/surgeon that this was a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and not a miscarriage. The surgeon needed to remove the affected fallopian tube since the pregnancy had developed for so long. It was at that point we realized that W's life had been hanging in the balance for the last several months. The following days and weeks were filled with anger, sadness, frustration, fear, and disbelief.\n\nIn the follow-up meetings with her new OB and savior (Dr. L), we were told that our ability to conceive would not be greatly impacted in the long term. The other tube looked healthy and we could continue trying to conceive once W was fully recovered from the surgery. Optimistic and hopeful, we thought that the worst was behind us, but we were wrong.\n\n...continue reading [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i8zae/our_story_part_2_hydrosalpinx/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Our story: Part 1 - Ectopic", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i8vx6/our_story_part_1_ectopic/"}, {"author": "the_jg", "author_created_utc": 1385958580, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_e5qlv", "created_utc": 1440450003, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1440453296, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i8zae/our_story_part_2_hydrosalpinx/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3i8zae", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3i8zae/our_story_part_2_hydrosalpinx/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "wLlC2v4yvLSFwhooxjF6FMJjvjB8P0a-pM2BlA2a6IY", "resolutions": [{"height": 115, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/q3dKb9NFrJ85yFam2BmR4xqWNloyZO9XdNoexMMGYaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=64ae3903797607957c8d84173fc06e1c", "width": 108}, {"height": 231, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/q3dKb9NFrJ85yFam2BmR4xqWNloyZO9XdNoexMMGYaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=74c5504e40cf8e543123e3bdaf1b9a89", "width": 216}], "source": {"height": 246, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/q3dKb9NFrJ85yFam2BmR4xqWNloyZO9XdNoexMMGYaA.jpg?s=86743af0c416f80e96c98f687f6c9b02", "width": 230}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1440526913, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "These posts are to share our story to those with a sympathetic ear.

Frustrated and determined, W made an appointment with a fertility clinic to help diagnose any potential issues. The initial ultrasound the fertility clinic performed revealed that W was days if not hours away from ovulating from the ovary next to the remaining tube. We were told to capitalize on this news as often as possible for the next few days. We did.\n\nDespite our best efforts, W did not become pregnant. We scheduled an [HSG test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterosalpingography) with the fertility clinic as a first step to determine if there was a cause for our lack of success. Thankfully, this procedure did not require general anesthesia, only a mild sedative. However, it is none the less an intimidating procedure. \n\nOnce the test was complete, the doctor performing the procedure, Dr. R, told us there was good news and bad news. The bad news was that W had a [hydrosalpinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosalpinx). This meant that due to the blockage and fluid buildup in the fallopian tube, there would be no way we could conceive naturally. It also meant we would definitely need to do IVF. Along with this, Dr. R informed us that he recommended that we have the remaining tube removed as well since a hydrosalpinx would reduce the chance of IVF succeeding by 50%. As one could imagine, W was quite upset. For those of you keeping track, the good news Dr. R was referring to was that we now knew why we were unable to conceive. I can certainly understand the frustration of not having any answers for infertility, however this was little comfort to us in the moment and far from our definition of 'good news'.\n\nOpting to have the remaining tube removed was an extremely difficult decision. W had never undergone any type of surgery prior to her emergency laparoscopy. Considering how unexpected and crushing the last experience was, W was very anxious about having another surgery. This however, paled in comparison to the decision to remove the remaining tube. After all, this would effectively make her sterile and our only chances of conceiving thereafter would be IVF. Ask yourself, would I volunteer to sterilize myself in order to improve my odds of conception? It sounds crazy, but this was the decision before us. \n\nAfter many days (or was it weeks?) of deliberation, W decided to have the other tube removed. The reasoning being, if it doesn't work and will only hurt our chances of conceiving from IVF, then it should be removed. \n\nW opted to have the procedure performed by Dr. L again. Due to W's job constraints, we had to wait for several months before the timing was right to perform the procedure. As Tom Petty says: waiting is the hardest part.\n\nIn our discussions with Dr. L prior to the surgery. Dr. L was given a strict mandate to ensure that the tube was definitely a hydrosalpinx and had no chance of recovering. After the procedure was over, Dr. L confirmed the tube was completely blocked, unusable, and had been removed.\n\nIt was official, W was now effectively sterile and we waited to begin our last best hope of conceiving: IVF.\n\n...continue reading [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i970n/our_story_part_3_ivf/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Our story: Part 2 - Hydrosalpinx", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i8zae/our_story_part_2_hydrosalpinx/"}, {"author": "Sassy_Pants24", "author_created_utc": 1423762546, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_lbicj", "created_utc": 1440450987, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i91nu/guess_what_my_gp_said_to_me_today/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3i91nu", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 20, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3i91nu/guess_what_my_gp_said_to_me_today/", "retrieved_on": 1440526881, "score": 20, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Had my annual check up.

That job is stressful and demanding to say the least. Considering all that we had been through, we wanted the best odds for success with IVF, so we waited until the school year was over and W would be able to rest comfortably, take care of herself, and keep her stress levels to a minimum.\n\nThe end of the school year would mark one and a half years since W first discovered she was pregnant. Up to this point my wife had a misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy and had been unknowingly dangerously close to dying. She had also undergone two laparoscopic procedures, one as an emergency to remove the tubal pregnancy, and the other to electively remove the other blocked/inflamed tube in order to greatly increase the odds of IVF success. She was now sterile and IVF was the only remaining option to conceive.\n\nThe time finally arrived, and W began the IVF protocol. This required birth control medicine to ensure proper timing of her ovulation cycle, followed by daily hormone injections, various medicines, and prenatal vitamins. On top of this, as time progressed, W was required to visit the fertility clinic almost daily for blood monitoring and ultrasounds. It was somewhat stressful, but always through it all, we knew that this could finally result in a pregnancy.\n\nAfter a couple weeks of this protocol, it was finally time to retrieve the eggs. This meant W must once again go under general anesthesia so that the fertility doctors could extract as many eggs from her (now greatly enlarged) ovaries.\n\nThe weeks of IVF protocol worked and the procedure was able to extract 18 eggs. Of these 18 eggs, 17 were confirmed to be successfully fertilized 24 hours later. By the day of the transfer, five days after the egg retrieval, there were 8 eggs remaining that were deemed of high enough quality to warrant transfer. One would be transferred, seven would be frozen.\n\nThe day of the transfer was a cautiously optimistic day for us. It was a long journey to get here and we were nervous, but excited. Once we got into the procedure room, we discovered that Dr. R would be the physician performing our transfer. This was merely a matter of scheduling, but Dr. R represented an ill omen for us considering our last encounter with him was far from positive. Always trust your gut.\n\nThe transfer went without incident and was confirmed to have been successfully deposited (by means of determining its absence from the syringe).\n\nOnce more we waited. Despite the fact the clinic explicitly advises you against doing an at-home pregnancy test (to guard against false positive/negatives) my wife performed four the day before and day of her appointment to have the official pregnancy test performed. W was pregnant! This was wonderful news and I was elated. Both the at-home and official lab work confirmed she was pregnant.\n\nTime went on and W's hCG levels were monitored. Everything looked good and it appeared the pregnancy was on schedule. Finally the day of our first ultrasound appointment arrived and we were excited, anxious, and nervous about the prospect of hearing the baby's heartbeat for the first time.\n\nI went with my wife to the appointment and held her hand as the doctor (Dr. W, our favorite) performed the ultrasound. Almost immediately, despite Dr. W's attempts to calm us, we knew something was amiss.\n\nAfter an agonizing few minutes, Dr. W told us that the pregnancy was there, however, it was not where it was supposed to be. It appeared to be in what little stump of a tube remained or (unbelievably) on her ovary.\n\nFor my wife, she knew exactly what this meant. For me, it required a bit more explanation to really sink in. This pregnancy was effectively over and my wife would require another surgery to remove the pregnancy. In fact the doctor insisted that she have it performed that night since it was (as before) endangering her health.\n\nMy wife was inconsolable at this point. For 18 months we had waited and endured more hardships than many couples endure over 10 years. We had been strong, *she* had been strong, but this latest news was too much to bear. This would be her third surgery. This would be the second time she needed emergency surgery to remove a tubal pregnancy! She would have surgery to remove a tubal pregnancy, despite the fact both of her tubes had previously been removed!\n\n...continue reading [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i9ckl/our_story_part_4_what_now/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Our story: Part 3 - IVF", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i970n/our_story_part_3_ivf/"}, {"author": "the_jg", "author_created_utc": 1385958580, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_e5qlv", "created_utc": 1440455574, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i9ckl/our_story_part_4_what_now/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3i9ckl", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3i9ckl/our_story_part_4_what_now/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "pEA0JHGPTA7f2PlZRZI66NfsLuDsaywSPB0lw-oJruw", "resolutions": [{"height": 99, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J7d3--gquh8qV5t6Q8iWbuvFJ6_2EsjqICWJIy6h1sg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=3c9d6681d77136f3d794328c5788e5c9", "width": 108}, {"height": 199, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J7d3--gquh8qV5t6Q8iWbuvFJ6_2EsjqICWJIy6h1sg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=4d118a533c5eafebd186ada779ee3e2a", "width": 216}], "source": {"height": 231, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J7d3--gquh8qV5t6Q8iWbuvFJ6_2EsjqICWJIy6h1sg.jpg?s=d5da1dc824e48bfe2e062996606d0819", "width": 250}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1440526740, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "These posts are to share our story to those with a sympathetic ear.

Roughly two hours. Since we scheduled the surgery almost immediately, the surgery wasn't complete until about 10:30PM. Our favorite doctor (Dr. W) came out from surgery to tell me that everything went fine. My wife did well in the surgery and Dr. W confirmed that it had been an ectopic pregnancy that had formed in the very tiny tubal stump left over from the previous surgery. If it had gone another week undiagnosed, my wife's life would have been in serious jeopardy.\n\nOne week after the surgery we met with Dr. W for a follow-up examination and to discuss the surgery and what the next steps should be.\n\nWhat we learned from that meeting was that the pregnancy was about two thirds in the tubal stump and one third in the [cornu or uterine horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_horns). With the combination of the pregnancy and hormones, the uterine wall had become extremely thin and delicate. Dr. W used the term ['friable'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/friable).\n\nThe concern Dr. W told us, was how well would my wife's uterus heal following the pregnancy and subsequent emergency surgery? The thin, friable part of her uterus was quite difficult to mend during the surgical procedure and required a special gel to seal, rather than stitches. Because of this, there is concern about how well my wife's uterus will recover and subsequently support a pregnancy.\n\nDr. W's recommendation is to perform another laparoscopy to perform a special blue dye injection into my wife's uterus and observe if the uterus is too thin anywhere (the thin parts would be transparent and the blue dye would be visible). This procedure would have one of three outcomes: the uterus is OK and no further intervention is required, the uterus is too thin is one section and would be stitched in a way to strengthen the thin areas, or the uterus is too thin or too affected to repair (in this case, [surrogacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy) would be the only option).\n\nOne alternative to all of this is to not perform this procedure and move forward with another attempt at IVF with one of our frozen embryos. We would have no way of know for sure how well her uterus has healed and my wife would need to be constantly monitored during a pregnancy.\n\nWe have now reached present day at this point in the story. The first day of school is here and my wife is now back to work. She has recovered well from the surgery, remarkably well.\n\nWe are faced with a decision. Do we perform another laparoscopy? That procedure, while common, will always present a risk but will inform us of the state of W's uterine health. If needed, this could possibly be corrected, but presents more potential for complications (for example, pregnancies that embed around the scar/stitch area).\n\nOr do we leave it all alone and trust in her body's ability to heal?\n\nThis is where we currently stand and the future is uncertain and scary.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Our story: Part 4 - What now?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i9ckl/our_story_part_4_what_now/"}, {"author": "mutha_fucking_nature", "author_created_utc": 1351042188, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9e5j3", "created_utc": 1440457566, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3i9h5l/husband_just_got_sa_results_but_doc_told_him/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3i9h5l", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3i9h5l/husband_just_got_sa_results_but_doc_told_him/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "hDnyJRD_tybd9H3qpmKec0-xXRe-j3enOeiZsXHIaNE", "resolutions": [{"height": 97, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=30c69859fc259cafed0c593eb655ff8e", "width": 108}, {"height": 194, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=b328cf5decde30e775f3c4cb8fb3ede2", "width": 216}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=6451e3114448d3aff20edb91ac96f216", "width": 320}, {"height": 576, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=9298765651319ff80a9b18aab863e643", "width": 640}, {"height": 864, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=f70fbb42cce8fc3e9f21fd0dd48d8ab7", "width": 960}, {"height": 972, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=228b5d4134dcfbb50bf02c6d993d9e5d", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 2297, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/ghzpOgCwTR8n1M7RbVbUAb-DOQV9oCgBnI6kpGmZGBg.jpg?s=d74218df20e3a18846853c0fd42c4231", "width": 2551}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1440526681, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[Here is the report.](http://i.imgur.com/e8VLJhx.jpg) For some reason the RE told him to go over it with his PCP, the PCP said the opposite, so all they said was \"your results were abnormal\" and gave no further info.

Unstimmed, with progesterone support, with a CP (of 7 16DPIUI) in the middle cycle. Our prior diagnosis was MFI but Mr. mL's counts keep going up and I've been knocked up on two unstimmed IUIs and one fluke. \n\nThe doc doesn't care about our CPs. They are not diagnostically relevant to her. The other two tied for longest at doubling once (peaking at 26 and 140) with neither making it to the end of the 5th week. \n\nThis was definitely surprising. She said that it was because we don't know how many CPs happen in the wild, so we don't know if they are diagnostically relevant in fertility-challenged couples. \n\nSince we did an IVF last year they had already seen my eggs and our embryos up close and although only getting 2 of 8-3s to freeze on day 3 was worse than expected, they apparently aren't worried yet about chromosomes and still think it was the stimming's fault. \n\nRight after our third CP I played a shitty game of telephone with the clinic because I wanted to know: if they were going to order a bunch of tests, I wanted to do the tests in time to get the results back for the August 19 appointment. So at this appointment the doctor was thinking I was demanding those tests when I was trying to ask if she wanted them. AWKWARD, I AM SO.\n\nWe decided to skip the karyotyping for now. We have pretty much decided we wouldn't do PGS anyway and we can check later if it's getting to us or we have RPL. \n\nThere were some public-insurance-covered tests she did order just for the hell of it - an SIS (which I haven't had done there nor since my biggest CP), a check of my thyroid (already back as normal), a something coagulant, and a lupus test (insert House reference). I decided to file these inspecifically as \"things she wants done.\"  All other tests are \"things she doesn't think we need.\"  This is a coping mechanism. \n\nAnd the timing maybe probably can work out to squeeze in the SIS during the BCP cycle of the long protocol I'm starting now (my period came between then and now), as long as I get a call back from her office in time. \n\nBut yes -- we're starting a long protocol! That's the awesome news. Three weeks BCP and then starting stimming a few days after they end. EDIT: and a nurse hinted that part of the stimming might overlap which makes my solo trip to Vancouver interesting.\n\nOf course that came with its own bombshells. There's no alternate trigger on their long protocol because they're already putting me on LH so they can't surprise my system with LH... so the trigger'll be hCG again. I was already on dostinex last time when I got my mild OHSS (sidelined for 7 days) but there's no such thing as a higher dose.\n\nThen she said \"so we'll have to monitor you to make sure that you aren't in OHSS before we decide if we're doing a freeze-all.\"\n\nUm what? I thought that because of last time we were definitely doing a freeze-all! And the more I think about it, the more I wish that were the case. It was such a relief to think that no matter what happened with the embryos I wouldn't have to think about going back to the clinic for the fresh transfer (which day? when? can I get a ride?) -- I could just focus on getting better from the retrieval. \n\nAnd I am really annoyed that there's no explanation for or diagnostic usefulness from the CPs. It shouldn't matter to me that she's dismissing it; even if there's something terribly wrong, they would want to check with and probably treat with IVF anyway. But it feels like a lose end that I wish they cared about.\n\nI talked to the doctor about the &lt;40% carbs, &gt;25% protein diet I've been trying which has a human study that seems legit. She doesn't like super-low-carb diets but was fine with 40% and told me to double-check what the max protein for my weight should be for kidney function (I found something that said a max of 1.1 per pound which is almost exactly 25% of my 1800cal a day). \n\nShe said she had seen research for CoQ10 for older women and that it wouldn't hurt. But on the flip side they don't want me on aspirin because of possible bleeding during the egg retrieval, so I'm going to continue to run any medicinal strategies past her before trying them. \n\nI feel like we count as unexplained more than MFI at this point. Purely MFI would not be giving us all these implanted embryos, not even only for a day or six. \n\nBut holy crap! We're in a treatment protocol! I'm picking up my BCP tomorrow to start them at bedtime. I paid my fees and got my one-on-two education session booked for me and Mr. mL to learn the new meds and brush up on the techniques, and find out if I will have to stab myself when I'm in Vancouver by myself the first week of September (I haven't stabbed myself even once yet). The trip moved from being days 7-14 when my period came FIVE days early. \n\nEdit for week counting (I hate calendar math).

She's thin, has hair, no excess body hair, and no skin issues. Her OB gave her clomid which led to a DNC due to the fetus stopping development around week 7. We had exceeded 6 months of clomid so we went to an RE.\n\nOur first RE told us she likely had PCOS (she never fully confirmed) and after many tests told us IUI or IVF. IUI being a 15% chance per cycle and IVF being 60% per cycle. Since insurance covered absolutely nothing and PCOS simply seems like we should get something like metformin (+ diet) to ovulate and get pregnant normally, we decided to go to a smaller RE. \n\nOur second RE got all of our records and basically is rerunning all the tests. Again, insurance covers nothing. He said the PCOS can be managed and things like IVF aren't necessary. But while we are waiting on that, he has some whacky diet for my wife. Since PCOS is similar to diabetes (type 1 runs in her family), we figured it was simple. But he pedaled his iPhone app that we can't get because we don't use iPhones and has no documentation about his specific diet. \n\nThe diet is essentially low glycemic index. But a few extras. No wheat, no potatos/rice AT ALL. Fine, that's high GI. No oatmeal (low GI). But dark chocolate is ok. He says the metformin will cause issues if she doesn't follow his diet to a T. Vomiting and diarrhea within an hour of eating something \"wrong\".\n\nWhen we went today for some blood work, she tried to ask about more specifics. A sheet of paper, why no oatmeal, etc. He was very snippy about it. Grapes (GI 59) are bad but kiwis (GI 58) are ok. He didn't have any helpful advice other than \"just eat what I told you to eat\". Mother fucker, you mentioned 12 ingredients. \n\nOur last RE didn't want to do another clomid cycle because she would want to do blood work and the cost is only $500 shy of an IUI.

I've been putting it off, and foolishly thought that maybe after having a baby, my body would \"fix\" itself. Boy, was I horribly, horribly wrong. \n\nAfter two annov cycles, I tried to do Femara on my own without my OBGYN knowing (I was scared to go back to the RE), and that didn't work either and ended up being annov. I sucked it up and went to my RE with all of your support, and yesterday was CD1. Tomorrow is my CD3 bloodwork and ultrasound, next week is my HSG and saline sonogram...and then I have to figure out where to go from there. \n\nI wanted to do another Femara cycle, but after all the annov cycles, I'm starting to think that is pointless, just like my RE told me. I wanted to conceive \"normally\" but, nothing is normal about what is going on with my body, so maybe I should move on from that pipe dream. \n\nI have the three attempts per live birth stipulation with our insurance. Last time, it took me four attempts (we had different insurance that didn't have that \"rule\"). I am stressed out about this time because of this. I am also stressed out because we have to pay, and last time, we didn't. \n\nI've been crying about it because my husband is mad about spending the money, and he said he's \"apathetic\" about trying for another baby because he doesn't want to go through all this again. I feel horribly guilty because this is my fault, and if I was a \"normal\" woman, I'd not have to shell out thousands of dollars to TRY to get pregnant. \n\nWe have two frozen embryos. We originally wanted to do two SETs, but now that will take up two of our three tries -- and three out of my four cycles failed with SETs. My fourth cycle was a FET and a double embryo transfer, which my son came out of. \n\nSo, our choice now is to start with a fresh cycle, hopefully get more embryos to freeze just in case, and then do subsequent FETs, or to start with the FET, transfer two embryos and then do a fresh cycle if that fails. \n\nMy husband doesn't want twins. I don't really either because I feel like it will hurt our relationship at this point. \n\nI'm being torn in so many directions.

I've popped in and out of here periodically for the last year and a half or so.  Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with my second ectopic pregnancy of the year - this on top of a 22-week loss after Femara/IUI due to cervical insufficiency last October.  \n\nI've been deeply grieving this latest loss since my ultrasound earlier this month - my pregnancy came as a bit of a surprise since my HCG levels started somewhat low (right at 25), but we had wonderful increases and my progesterone looked great, so even my doctor felt confident that life was finally turning around after grieving my son for nearly a year.  Not so much.  I am a bit lucky in that both of my ectopics were able to be treated with methotrexate and my tubes have been spared.  I have a blood draw tomorrow at which we are expecting my HCG to be at zero - a relatively fast resolution, especially compared to this spring, when my ectopic took more than a month and a half to resolve.  \n\nThe doc and I have spoken briefly about the future, and a big part of my grief this past week has been the news that IVF will likely be the safest and most effective option should we want to keep trying to build a family (and we do).  Knowing that a future pregnancy will be considered high-risk, require frequent monitoring of my cervix, and entail a cerclage and weekly P17 injections is heavy enough...but now we're adding to the mix the need for invasive intervention just to get pregnant again.  My heart is heavy, and my only consolation is that IVF is effective and takes my risk of another ectopic down from something like 25-50% to 1-3% (basically the same risk at in the general population).  We have a consult with my RE on Friday to debrief this latest loss, lay out all the options, and start talking about what IVF will look like for us.  I'm not sure if this will be an actual IVF consult for us or if we'll need a separate appointment to get into the nitty gritty of treatment.  (My hunch is the latter.) \n\nSo tell me - are any of you going through IVF due to ectopic pregnancies?  What did your doctors tell you?  What questions should I ask on Friday?  Is there anyone over in /r/InfertilityBabies with a success story that I might seek out?  (As you might imagine, I'm hesitant to venture over there and ask directly right now.)
