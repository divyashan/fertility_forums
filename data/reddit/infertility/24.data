On Tuesday (May 10) I started having cramping on one side and light bleeding. The following day (Wed), my beta (#4) had only risen 30% of what was expected. I went to the hospital that afternoon as I was concerned about ectopic due to the (mild) pain on one side and the beta at the hospital was 755 (down from about 1300 that morning at the Clinic). Thursday I saw the on call OBGYN (referred by the hospital) and she felt it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy but a collapsing corpus luteum. On Friday, my clinic did another beta to confirm the miscarriage (had dropped to about 300). I stopped my endometrin that morning. Since then, I have had occasional, mild cramping and light bleeding (pantyliner is all that's needed). I have been off work since Wed. morning and was planning to go back tomorrow, but now that the full bleeding hasn't started yet, I don't know if I should just stay home and wait so I am somewhere comfortable and familiar when it starts or if I should go in and just leave if/when the bleeding starts. I have read online that sometimes it can take a week or two for the bleeding to really start. \n\nDoes anyone have any knowledge of what and when I can expect everything to start?

I'm really upset right now and this is how I'm trying to deal with it.\n\nA couple months ago, my IVF attempt failed when I decided to ovulate through my ovulation antagonist drug. What I didn't share at the time was that I got home after my clinic appointment and bawled my eyes out. My husband was nice about all that, we didn't really talk - he just sort of held onto me until I stopped crying. It was a hard day, really, I was exhausted by that point.\n\nHonestly I felt finished with the whole effort afterward. For what reason would I do IVF again?? but it's funny that after a couple months I felt a little better and agreed to go back to the clinic to talk about one last go with my husband and Doctor.\n\nWhile my husband and I were in the consult, after reviewing the result of the last IVF failure, my husband mentioned that I had actually taken the failed IVF pretty hard, and also that the toll on me was high due to the way I \"heavily invested emotionally\" into the procedure. My Doc agreed \"you mean like, she gets obsessed? yeah. that's pretty common.\" They exchanged a couple more words about how the IVF mums can go through a lot and get a little crazy. My husband nodded his head and laughed. I wanted to punch him in the face. The doctor gave me the clinic counsellors card and smiled compassionately, suggested we give her a call for supportive services. I wanted to punch her in the face also.\n\nThere I was sitting, trying not to burst into tears - something I am not prone to doing, particularly in public, and ready to strangle him for saying that. After we left I told him I was upset by that whole exchange and he apologized but admitted he couldn't understand why - he said we all need help sometimes and I've chosen to endure something emotionally difficult and I should not be above admitting when I need help coping. I had a hard time explaining it myself, actually.\n\nI told him it's because he just effectively diminished me, cast me as \"the crazy lady\"or the fragile patient to be baby-sat. I told him I don't appreciate being cast in this way in light of what I have tried to do, and the weight I have carried for three failed procedures and counting.  I explained that from all sides, I realize that I feel threatened when I go through these procedures. And who is there to lift me up and tell me I'm doing great? NO ONE. Instead I get treated like I'm \"fragile\" or obsessed, encouraged to not \"get too wrapped up\" despite the daily regimen involved and the fact that my world gets turned upside down every time I go through a procedure. \n\nMy work loses patience as I take off all sorts of time for appointments I can't even be honest about. Physically, I inject and endure the daily rigor of the cramps, side effects and ultrasounds. Mentally, I endure the toll of the potential results - knowing any result will be a lot to process and to bear. On top of that I endure the watching, monitoring and interpreting of the clinic and the staff and their tests, waiting for their call and wondering if they've done things correct, enduring all the procedures not to mention getting the run around pretty regularly which I expect is probably par for the course. \n\nIt's exhausting, and the worst part is the way my husband talks to me - telling me not to get my hopes up, reminding me to shift my focus, losing patience with me when I try to talk to him about things \"too much\" while he sits in his fucking ivory tower getting off scot free and treating me like he's tolerating me. I walk on eggshells, trying not to relay to much emotional investment, trying to take things in stride, so as not to be coddled and reprimanded by him for \"getting my hopes up\" or \"becoming obsessive\" while noticing how bored be becomes with the details I've waited to share all day.\n\nI asked my husband: what positive thing has come out of any of this that I should want to ever do it again??

Mostly because we have only been at this for 18mths (although at 38, we don't have a super long time to try), but also because even with surgeries, chlomid, gonal-f shots, and IUI, I still want more that anything for this not to be true, and participating makes it way too true. (TL;DR at bottom)\n\nShort as can be intro of shit I've been through so far, we started trying as soon as we were married in Sept of 2014. Was already 36, so immediately dived into monitors and charting, and for the most part everything seemed cyclically okay.  Short of a little spotting here and there, so with six month of no results we went to obgyn. Im an avid googler and in my mind blocked tubes seemed like the likely culprit, but when they did the ultrasound they said blood was outside my uterus and had a little growth of some sort that was not a big deal compared to the dreaded Endo.  They got me an appt at specialist in 30 days and gave me a pamphlet on Endo.  Thanks guys!\n\nSo my googling begins, starting with specialist. This would be the one and only time I ever requested to use a different specialist.  I'm not sure if I made the right choice since I never went to him, but all his reviews, rather glowing or bashing, mentioned he was a man of strong religious conviction, so much so that even those that shared that conviction were a little thrown.  I am not religious, I do live in the Bible Belt, and while usually to each his own, when it comes to fertility treatments and the emotions attached, not to mention some religious opinions about certain things made me really uncomfortable, and I immediately switched.  Irrelevant, but I thought worth mentioning and didn't know if others had experience either positively or negatively this this. \n\nSo, after thirty days of reading the gloom and doom of Endo, I go see the specialist I chose and she explained they had misinterpreted ultrasound.  The growth, with they had mention secondary and even said it may not need to be removed, was actually three growths that had combined, making one pretty massive 9cm sphere of mass (it wasn't a tumor or a cyst and proved to be benign, but never know what to call it). So picture a sphere with about a 3-1/2\" diameter, and this was pushing blood outside uterine lining and twisting my tubes, one real bad, one not so bad.  The only treatment option that ended with me being able to carry a child (I will by default have to have c-section) is a myomectomy, a procedure that used to be terrible, then laparoscopy made not so bad, but recent discovery about laparoscopic procedure made them go back to terrible version....Yay Me!\n\nSo two straight months on letrazole to shrink growth and 3 months of recovery time and we are ready to start trying for real.  Bad new is is procedure we lost one tube, so we are not great, but still doable.  So we do low dose chlomid.  Not that many eggs, and on wrong ovary, no worries, up dose and although not a rule, usually ovaries tend to alternate.  Next month same thing, maybe let's try some injectables.  And what now seems to be the norm, few eggs on wrong ovary, only now they are worried, so few eggs with injectables is just not right. So a few more fucked cycles like that and we come down to this: IVF with your egg 10-15% success as highest that can give.  So I had looked into donor eggs, and since I've been reassured time and time again it's just eggs and tubes, donor eggs seem ideal.  We had looked at adoption, so not being genetically mine, while a bummer, I was okay with it. \n\n**So this is where shit gets kinda weird.  I tell my mom and sis this, we are a close family, now.  Prior to my sis and I being born, my mom gave up two kids for adoption, but they are both back in out life, and while its takes a bit of adjusting, we are all excited about more family to love (trust me this is relevant).  So, newly found out about half-sis also is informed of decision to do donor eggs, and she passed info on to newly found half brother about same situation. This wasn't done gossipy, this was done because, honestly, my default is to just share with the same two people I have for 36 years, I don't intentionally, but I sometimes forget to include. So, for example, when talking about donor eggs if an RE says to me do you have any younger siblings or relatives to donate eggs, I may forget that I in fact have an 18 year old niece.  I mean I only met her once, and why she was darling and sweet, I forget these things.  She, however, is more aware, and more kind hearted than I ever dreamed, and she actually offered to donate eggs for us, and as of right now this is the plan.\n\nSo, that's my intro, sorry if makes little sense.  I felt the need to finally reach out and participate today because it's one of those day I feel so lost and hopeless. My niece went for her initial appointment, but since we are a 2000 miles apart, I haven't met all the doctors where we are going to be doing it.  I don't know a time frame or a cost stricture and feel absolutely lost.  I can't get a hold of anyone and they had planned on the whole process being done in June or July.  I kinda have felt like this the entire time, even with my RE.  I felt like a plan of attack, like try this, if this fails try this then, is never given to me.  Everything is just up in the air at all times.  Am I not asking the right questions to pin down what I need?  My mother in law, who I love dearly but micromanages shit to death, I had sit in on consult trying to use that skill, but she's still unsure....eh.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, before my TL;DR I just wanted to know what people experiences, if anyone has any, with known donors.  I'm seeing a therapist who has helped me see my feelings of guilt with my niece donating and my in-laws paying, and kinda unbox and deal with those.  But the aftermath, after the child is born, and having the donor be in their life, but as cousin not mom, or uncle not grandpa, it's all so abstract until suddenly it won't be.\n\nTL;DR: Year long struggle with trying to get pregnant, will end up using donor eggs, was going to be anon, but I forgot that my mother had a son she gave up for adoption who is now reunited with a daughter who is 18 and willing to donate. They live across states and ATM frustrated with trying to deal with clinic, but curious about anyone that used known donor eggs.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro from long time lurker", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4jrxji/intro_from_long_time_lurker/"}, {"author": "gingerhairedgirl", "author_created_utc": 1353632241, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "26F 27M, PCOS & MFI, TTC Nov 2014", "author_fullname": "t2_9omlz", "created_utc": 1463504877, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1463592020, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4jryi2/alberta_girl_wishing_for_an_ontario_world/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4jryi2", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 18, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4jryi2/alberta_girl_wishing_for_an_ontario_world/", "retrieved_on": 1466466375, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So today my mom and I get onto the topic of babies and how when she was visiting her sister in Ontario she seen a psychic who told her I would have two children, the first at 29.\n\nNow my family does believe that there are some good psychics out there, so please don't automatically trash that (it's giving me a glimmer of hope).\n\nThen she was telling me how my aunt had let her know that in Ontario OHIP covers the procedure for one IVF round (medication will be about $5000). \n\nThis news is great!

I'll let you all be the judge.\n\nGPS announces we're about to turn on to tapachalpus street (or some other equally hard to spell/pronounce name). So I ask the driver how the GPS does with all the street names around there. She laughs and says it's gotten a lot better, but then lists a bunch of examples of names it previously had gotten wrong. When that topic peters out she moves to, \"I just need to get $100 so I can quit for the night.\"\n\nI try to be responsive and say, \"well that's kinda nice that you only have to work until you meet your goal!\" Immediately she gets into the soliloquy about how her daughter asks for money all the time and never puts her back. Trying to steer the conversation off without too much obviousness. I ask her how many children she has. She responds, \"TOO MANY!!! Too, too, many!! TOO MANY!\" I uncomfortably laugh and say, \"so.... 2?\" This is where shit gets uncomfortable and weird.\n\nImmediately she says her son is fine, he never asks for anything and is doing ok. But reiterated how her daughter basically steals from her. Again, trying desperately to end this awkwardness, I tell her that I'm sure she her daughter appreciates her. Wrong approach apparently. She goes OFF. I mean just OFF. About how terrible her daughter is.\n\nHere are the worst of the things she said.\n1) Over and over again she said, \"I don't owe her nothing! She owes me everything!\"\n2) I could have had an illegal abortion, she should be lucky to be in this world.\n3) I could have left her on the door step of the church, but instead I took care of her and raised her- she should be grateful!\n\nYou get the idea. I mean just terrible, terrible things. I couldn't believe that another human would think these things, let alone verbalized them to complete strangers AND it's about their own child.Inside I was thinking about al my friends who are being torn apart by the adoption process and wanted to yell at her that her daughter might have been better off being adopted by a loving and caring home with enough love to go around and wouldn't see the child as a burden. But obviously I didn't do that... I just sat in awkwardly staring at my husband while she ranted and then when she stopped I just sat in silence. \n\nStupid uber made me rate her the next time I opened the app....

I went through months of tests and no conclusion was ever reached other than my ovaries don't really do their job. I've seen several more Dr's along the way and they've all been fairly dismissive since I wasn't actively trying to get pregnant. I started estrogen/progesterone treatments back then and have continued since. I got married last year and my husband and I have talked openly about both wanting a family. We both know however that there's a good chance it will never happen. Many of my friends and family my age have been starting announcing pregnancies/births  recently. I'm very happy for them, but I can't help but feel torn up about it. Anyway, long opening to the story... I came back to work today after having Monday off (I was sick) to my coworkers joking that I must have stayed home because I'm pregnant. The \"joke\" drug on all day and spread through the office to the point that I had people from different departments asking about it. I know they were kidding and aren't aware of my situation, but it just completely crushed me. All day long I had people coming up to me asking if I was expecting, and every time it pushed me even closer to crying. I managed to get home without saying anything and vented to my husband a little. I guess I just don't know what to do from here. Do I go try to get more answers from drs to find out if there may be a chance? Or should I just try to accept that pregnancy will never happen for me? Anyway, thanks for reading.

We finally spoke to our doctor today for the first time since before the retrieval.  If you recall, that was 3 days before the retrieval, and at the time I had 14 mature follicles and another 5-7 medium follicles.  He seemed pretty confident that we should get around 20 eggs overall, but those out of the medium follicles probably wouldn't be mature.  \n\nAnd on retrieval day, a different doctor did the actual retrieval, and he was only able to get 9 eggs (not 20), and of those we were told by embryology that only 5 were mature.  The Dr. who did the retrieval said something about the Lupron shot not working as intended and that the eggs were likely still \"stuck\" to the wall of the follicle and didn't detach like they were supposed to.\n\nOur doctor does not think it was the case though.  He said he looked at my blood work (LH levels, progesterone levels) and everything was looking exactly like it should under successful trigger circumstances.  He also said a Lupron trigger fail is more likely to result in a complete failure - no eggs - and it doesn't really do a half-and-half situation like we had.\n\nHe said that overall he thinks the follicles were completely empty, and that is supported by the remaining 4 eggs that weren't mature.  So going back, we had 9 eggs retrieved, and we were told 5 of them were mature (and ICSI'd).  We understandably assumed that meant the remaining 4 were simply immature.  Not the case.  Those 4 were total shit.  They were a mixture of broken zonas and empty zonas.  They were totally unusable and no amount of maturing was going to do the trick.\n\nBut then he said I'm kind of an enigma, because on one hand I create either nothing or total crap, and on the other hand my 5 eggs that were good were \"rockstars\" (his words) and he chuckled when he said that getting all 5 eggs to blast was very uncommon.  He kept saying that I was very black or white - terrible or awesome.  So go me?\n\nAnyway, overall he was very enthusiastic about the 4 good blasts we have frozen.  I know the 5th isn't awesome (4BC) and at some point when we get to that one, we'll pair it up with a better one.  But for now, we'll start with our perfect little ninja, the 4AA day 5, for a single embryo transfer on June 3rd.  Just over two weeks away!\n\nIn the end, he definitely thinks this is a systemic issue with my ovaries and that it's likely a big contributing factor to our infertility.  We still don't know of course if we also have an issue getting the sperm into the egg naturally because we did ICSI, so who knows on that one, but at a minimum we can pretty confidently say that there are likely few cycles in the past 3 years where there was a usable egg (or even an egg at all).  But that also does explain why we did get pregnant once, because I don't make 100% crap eggs.  And that one time was just bad luck that it was a blighted ovum.\n\nOh and finally, we did ask if he thought that the egg quality of the remaining 5 could be poor and impact success, and he said not at this point.  He said they wouldn't have fertilized and they definitely wouldn't have made it to blast, so he was confident in the quality of the 5 we do have.\n\nRoller coasterrrrr!  But I really am glad to be coming out of this both with some good embryo possibilities and also with some insight into our otherwise previously unexplained infertility.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update: What the hell happened at my retrieval", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4jx9t6/update_what_the_hell_happened_at_my_retrieval/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463593195, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4jxvx1/going_in_for_my_hsg_today/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4jxvx1", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 21, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4jxvx1/going_in_for_my_hsg_today/", "retrieved_on": 1466469212, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Going in for my HSG today", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4jxvx1/going_in_for_my_hsg_today/"}, {"author": "artipants", "author_created_utc": 1287690843, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "33 1 tube, controlled hypothyroidism", "author_fullname": "t2_4g7oi", "created_utc": 1463601038, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4jyklf/are_you_sure_youre_not_pregnant_or_why_i_cried_at/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4jyklf", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4jyklf/are_you_sure_youre_not_pregnant_or_why_i_cried_at/", "retrieved_on": 1466469532, "score": 12, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I was home sick with a stomach thing the past two days.

We complete all of our adoption paperwork and start on our Dear Birth Mother letter.\n\n-March 2016- Second cycle of Clomid, Ovidrel trigger shot, timed intercourse.

Is it possible that she just misspoke or does my dr not know what test he's looking at?\n\nAssuming they are looking at the right thing and their new recommendation stands, has anyone had any experience with differing interpretations of HSG test results?\n\nI am freaking out right now. I already emailed and called and left a message with her to be like... Umm ok, so wtf does that mean for my treatment options?\n\nDetails for the unfamiliar. First RE did HSG and on the spot diagnosed one blocked tube with hydrosalpinx and other tube showing signs of damage so tubal ligation was required before IVF and IVF was the only option. Immediately made an appointment for 2nd opinion with new clinic and had to wait 2 months to get in. At this appointment the dr said he hasn't seen the films but was confident in the diagnosis and then spent 2 hours talking about his IVF protocol for me. This is now the same dr, who I guess finally got around to actually looking at the films. Based on all of this we decided to proceed with tubal ligation, ER, FET. In the mean time though, the first dr recommended me to a surgeon, and that office had called to schedule said surgery, but I decided to schedule with my original RE who could also perform the surgery for June 9th. My mother bought plane tickets to help me through the surgery and everything.\n\nI mean ultimately it would be a dream come true for my tubes to remain intact (assuming they are healthy).

She is curently pregnant for the fourth time. However, she has anxiety about an ultrasound tomorrow that she is suspicious will bring bad news to this pregnancy as well (based on her doctor's visit last week). She is on progesterone and our past issue (if I don't butcher this with my medical ignorance) is that the fetus has trouble attaching to the the wall of her uterus. I like to be cautiously optimistic about most scenarios in life, but if she has an iffy feeling about tomorrow, then I don't want to have my head in the sand.\n\nNow the only advice I am looking for on here, from anyone willing to offer it- are there any specific ideas as to what I should do for her if this ultrasound does not go well tomorrow? I've been playing it supportive, yet calm and reserved with this pregnancy because I don't want to make it about me at all. I don't want her to worry about me and my feelings of the situation. I understand this is our journey, but it's her physical (and psychological) burdens and trauma, which is tough when she is a generous people pleaser who would end up worrying as much (or even more so) about my worries and disappointment. I worry that some of my disappointments in the past losses have brought her added stress. I love this woman so much. She is tough as nails, beyond beautiful and has massive generosity in her heart- the makings of a warm, loving mother. Each time this happens, it understandably drags her into a pit of dispair. It kills me and I feel powerless in my attempts to pull her out when it does happen.\n\n In the end, she is my wife and I should know her better than anyone. However, I figured it wouldn't hurt to reach out to hear from anyone in similar situations who have been given strong support or, inversely, had their partner say or do the exact wrong thing for the situation.

So that appointment happened today.  The conclusion was the eggs were no good, subsequent cycles would yield just as few eggs, and sperm actually went down from our last recheck so medicated cycles were out.\n\nWe had told her at the transfer that if this didn't work, we wanted to discuss donated embryos.  The DOR and MFI are just incompatible for treatment.  It seems you can have one but not the other, at least that's how it has felt for us. We brought it up again today, and she said she'd get us to talk to the third-party coordinator.  She seemed a little relieved.  I don't blame her-- it's probably painful to watch patients go through multiple cycles with little success. And really, we just want to be parents.  \n\nThe meeting with the coordinator went well. She's just an inspiring woman-- she even has been a gestational carrier.  She said the program has embryos at the moment awaiting matches, that she coordinates them herself, the waitlist isn't TOO long, and just overall we felt good about it. Seems that the open donations also offer the right amount of boundaries that we are comfortable with (I was a tad worried given they would be local).  Anyway, she said she just got a larger donation of embryos in, but they are not white and she asked about our openness on that front. My husband and I are both white and blonde-- even if we'd had a white baby, it would likely have not been blonde so it would have raised some eyebrows anyway (because even the dumbest people know that blonde+blonde=blonde), AND we're open about our infertility journey at this point.   We'd previously discussed it, but it never feels real until there is a possibility.  I'm glad to say that even now that the possibility is very real, we are still open to moving ahead with that (I know it presents a unique set of challenges, but we're smart, open people and are willing to overcome hurdles associated with that and advocate for our children in any ways that they may need). Plus, the possibility of a larger set of embryos would mean we'd get to likely have children who are biological siblings, so that unique experience would be shared and no one would experience anything alone, which I love so much.  She said she is working on matching in the next couple weeks, so we could actually know something soon, which fills me with a little hope.  There are no guarantees on a match just yet, but I think this is a step in the right direction.\n\nLastly, I asked my doctor about some cramping I had around my right ovary (the one that produced all the follicles), worrying that maybe there was endo?  She said it was likely just trauma from the retrieval, but that she'd prescribe me some BCP since we're just going to move on to FETs of donated embryos.  I also asked her if I could go back on keto (I stopped last year once we confirmed I do not have PCOS), as I'd gained 40 lbs throughout the IF process.  She said I didn't look like I'd gained that much weight (awww, nice RE!) and that I could but would have to stop about a month prior to a transfer.  Husband and I talked and even if we match soon, I plan on taking 3 months off to reclaim my body and stop getting probed in the vag for a little bit.  Plus, it'd be awesome to kick my butt back into gear before getting pregnant.\n\nI feel more optimistic today than I have in a long time.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "An update on our situation... we're moving to donated embryos", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4k3vpl/an_update_on_our_situation_were_moving_to_donated/"}, {"author": "Wonderlanded", "author_created_utc": 1411078435, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "32 F/ TTC 2+ years / DOR - POI & bad tubes", "author_fullname": "t2_igqab", "created_utc": 1463686331, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4k48nn/dor_pof_how_aggressive_did_you_get/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4k48nn", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 18, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4k48nn/dor_pof_how_aggressive_did_you_get/", "retrieved_on": 1466472246, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm meeting with my RE tomorrow morning to talk things over but would love to hear from those of you who have gone through this. \n\nIn short: I'm 32, my AMH is 0.23, my FSH is 14.5, antral follicle count is ~8 depending (I had a big ol' cyst which has hopefully gone away). \n\nTo complicate things, I also probably have tubes which aren't working correctly (though there's no way to completely prove this), so IUI is unlikely to do anything, even if my eggs are fine. \n\nMy RE would like us to start IVF ASAP.

We just got my day 3 bloodwork done, we've tested 2 months in a row now but obviously don't have any long-term information, so I have no idea how quickly my fertility is declining. I just know it's pretty bad already. Is waiting 5 more months to satisfy insurance requirements a really bad idea?\n\nDid anyone self-pay with Aetna? If so, did they cover medications? I wonder if we pay the $22k for IVF, if Aetna will still pay for medication and take that out of our fertility insurance bucket. That would be ideal, really, because then we get that $22k back if we're not successful, and we don't have to pay for medication. I have a $25k lifetime limit for fertility payments for insurance, so even if we did 6 rounds of medicated cycles and then IVF, we'd still be paying out of pocket for some of it, because surely all of that costs more than $25k.\n\nI hate this stuff.

Basically the radiologist who reviewed my HSG said I had a very dilated left tube and right tube showed minor signs of some dilation. However, both sides spilled. My (2nd) dr reviewed this film and the radiologists report and agreed with the radiologist.\n\nTechnically if the tube is open, i.e. Showed signs of spillage, it is not a hydrosalpinx and you do not need to have the tube removed or ligated. This is because the fluid has somewhere other than your uterus to go. \n\nMy 2nd dr didn't have access to the ultrasound they did at 1st Dr's office after the HSG that supposedly showed the (still) dilated tube 2 weeks after the HSG, so he couldn't really comment on that one. \n\nMy personal opinion is that the tube spilled with the force of injecting the dye in, but when left to its own devices it is more than happy to sit there and/or flow backward. Therefore I wouldn't feel comfortable pursuing IVF without at least poking around in there to see what's going on. I've already had my pre op with the surgeon/1st Dr. Thanks to /u/MackieMouse, I asked and insisted that they do the blue dye test before touching my tubes. Therefore when they go in they will have indisputable proof my tubes are either blocked or clear. Also they will be \"draining\" the \"hydrosalpinx\" assuming there is one. \n\nSo if my tubes are clear and there is no residual dilation, the tube can stay and they will just take a lot of pretty pictures and biopsies to find out what the hell is going on in my abdomen. More likely though, even if my tubes are open, if there is still residual dilation, the tubes gotta go (IMO). I've also discussed with my dr about thoroughly looking at the least shitty tube and make a judgement call during surgery if it had to go too. Bottom line, surgery is still a go for June 9th- just need to verify they don't get too excited with those scalpels too soon.\n\nTL;DR: IVF coordinator sent one sentence email that completely detailed plans in motion, only to find out there is just a slim chance anything at all will change and I should still have the surgery, even if, just for diagnostic purposes.\n\nIn other news. 2nd dr is retiring before we will be able to start IVF, so I have to have a meeting to transfer care to a new dr. However, this is the dr I originally wanted and can now get scheduled with her faster because I'm a displaced orphan :-P so I have an appointment with her 4 days after the surgery.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE: Possible HSG Misdaignosis", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4k4cuz/update_possible_hsg_misdaignosis/"}, {"author": "FrogofAges", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463688807, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4k4g1t/reassurance/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4k4g1t", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4k4g1t/reassurance/", "retrieved_on": 1466472342, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi guys, new here.

Somehow, miraculously, the first FET we did worked, and my husband and I have a wonderful, sweet toddler.  We did a second FET this past March which ended in a chemical pregnancy.  Given how poorly I responded to stims, our RE steered us toward donor eggs for any additional cycles.  We would like to have another child, and now are deciding between fresh or frozen DE.  Our clinic (PFC in San Francisco) guarantees at least two 6-cell day 3 embryos graded 1 or 2 with frozen, no guarantees for fresh.  We were devastated after our second FET failed, and I'm really not sure I have the emotional bandwidth for more FET failures.

The plan was to do the saline ultrasound, then the med teach class for the shots we will be administering, then blood work and urine sample.  \n\nLast summer I had my HSG done (all clear)  and while it was def not a walk in the park I didn't have any pain at all besides the 10 seconds they shot dye through the tubes.  Wellllll this was a different experience.  \n\nSo the catheter part was good to go, but they kept having to dump more and more saline into my uterus.  Turns out the reason is because they found a polyp on my endometrial lining.  Once they took everything out of me and I sat up they started showing me the polyp on the screen and starting talking about needing to shave it off.  I have no idea what happened to me at that point but I became extremely nauseous.  I laid down on the table and the nurse gave me a cold washcloth for my forehead.  They left the room and said they would give me a couple minutes to get dressed.  So the nausea gets worse.  I essentially crawl to the adjoining bathroom where I lay on the floor with my forehead on the toilet (ew I know but at this point it was so bad).  I end up throwing up twice.  I have no idea why because it wasn't even that painful!!!  What in the world.  Maybe it was the whole talk about shaving off something in my uterus.\n\nSo anyway.  I have my hysteroscopy scheduled for Monday now so they can take care of that and it'll just be a small bump in the road and won't throw off the IVF plan.

It was in the locker room this morning with a work-friend. We both work for the same employer, just in different buildings/departments, and we both go to the same gym in the morning. We're \"work friends.\" I genuinely like this woman.\n\nLong story short, she asked about how the fertility treatment was going, then, mid-sentence, she interrupts me (which is *such* a pet peeve of mine) to tell me about how this lawyer she knows was defending this woman who wanted her baby back after giving it up for adoption to an infertile couple. Then, they had to give the baby back (and you know what comes next) but went on to have two children of their own. Ugh.\n\nI was so irritated and hurt. Obvs. I told her we all aren't so lucky to be able to borrow babies in order to have our own, that most couples *are* given a chance to conceive, but will likely live out their fertile years before having a statistically meaningful chance of conceiving naturally. I also said that, with the amount of pain and money they exerted to adopt and then loose the baby, I bet they decided to use donor gametes or donor embryos to avoid that heartache from happening again.\n\nShe said \"oh, maybe, but I really think there's something in the mind that just relaxes and let's it happen.\" I feel like I deserve a freaking medal for not punching her then telling her to relax the pain/shock away.\n\nI said, with a smirk, that no one tells men with a low sperm count to \"relax.\" This was a methodical choice of words because I know this woman to be a STAUNCH feminist. I wish you guys could have seen her face change. She immediately apologized and said \"you're right, that's bullshit.\" She then said she was sorry if she hurt my feelings. I said it was okay; it's just that the miracle stories, while amazing, aren't the norm and hope is a dangerous thing to hold on to. I said her words did hurt, but I know she didn't *mean* to hurt me.

I'm new to this, and don't quite know how to feel.  I'm 27, and I've had a long history with endometriosis- I've had 2 laparoscopic procedures so far in the past 6 years, this past one showing deep infiltrating stage 4 endo.  Pain has definitely been managed surgically, but in terms of fertility, I didn't think too much into it.\n\nMy husband and I got married 2 years ago after 4 years of being together, so I'd say that we still qualify as newlyweds! :)  We weren't considering starting a family until 3-4 years from now, and wanted to get married early so that we can enjoy our time together (because of work and school, we've had to spend a lot of time apart in separate cities and have finally been living together for almost 1 year now).  About a month ago, we went to an RE at the insistence of my GYN, and were told that if we ever wanted kids, it was a close to zero chance of it working without IVF, and even with IVF, a very low chance.  I had an AMH level of under 1, and the ultrasounds weren't too promising either.  This was surprising to my RE considering my age, despite the stage 4 endo.  \n \nThis was confusing news, mainly because we weren't really in a place to think about kids immediately, and now all of a sudden have to decide if it's something we will regret if we don't try IVF asap while there still might be a window!  Lots of long chats ensued, and we decided after some research that it will most likely take a few rounds anyway, so we'll do a round of egg freeze first to see what there is to work with, if anything at all, and then see if doing immediate IVF makes sense for us.  Freezing seemed like a good compromise, and we can always thaw whenever we feel ready, even if it is a couple months later.  Though with my endo, the more time we wait, the less likely we are able to go back in just in case the eggs don't take.\n\nI started my injections a few days ago, and we will see how it goes.  I'm definitely the only one I know of in my friends circle to be dealing with something like this right now, so we are just taking it all day by day and trying to base decisions off of what we find!  \n\nAll of this happened to coincide with a really great job opportunity in a different city that I have been considering, which would put us in separate places again, so in a way it makes me feel like I have to decide between career and baby if all goes well with this egg retrieval!  Where we are living right now for my husband's job doesn't really work for my field, so I've had to freelance from home so that we could live together.  It has been tough in some ways, but great in others!  It just feels like a lot happening at once, and like there is no right answer.  We are both just not sure what we would regret more, because having a family and both of us being able to be happy in our careers are equally important to us!\n\nWe have gone through probably every emotion over the past few weeks, especially since it is not something that we are suddenly being forced to think about, but the thing we are definitely sure of is that we do both want a family someday, so doing nothing is not an option!\n\nAnyway, that's my current story- nice to meet you all :) ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to the shitty club!

Quick background - husband (33) and I (28) started trying for a baby August 2015, have had two CPs, and were diagnosed with unexplained infertility last month. I know we are not at the one year mark, and I truly hope this does not offend. All my tests (saline sono, HSG) and bloodwork came back fairly normal, except for low vitamin D and higher than average AMH (7.8). Husband's sperm is good except for 3.5% morphology. I have 28 day cycles and ovulate on day 14. We just finished our first cycle on clomid+TI, which was a bust.\n\nWe are scheduled to do femara+IUI in the coming cycle. My question is - is there a huge advantage to ultrasound monitoring and trigger? My RE wants me to do OPKs at home. However, I've read that quite a few people are not comfortable doing IUI without ultrasound and trigger. Besides knowing the size of the follicles and lining, is there an advantage to doing ultrasound and trigger? I ovulate on my own, and research I've found suggests that women that ovulate do slightly better without a trigger. We're paying for the whole thing out of pocket too, but I'd rather pay more if that means we might be even slightly more successful. \n\nBesides thinking about all this a lot, I watch probably too many reality shows and cuddle with my two poodles.

I'm extremely frustrated right now because I feel like I may have mucked up our chances for IUI #2 this month and I have some questions. First, the back story:\nThis cycle, same as the last IUI we did in March, I took 100mg of Clomid on CDs 4-8, and started using OPKs on day 11.  I've been using the ClearBlue Digital tests (the kind that show you high and peak days), as well as supplemental cheapo test strips that I purchased at Walmart. I use both the ClearBlue and the cheap strip at the same time each day because I'm weird and paranoid about missing my surge, so I like to have a test and a confirmation test...\n\nI got a low fertility result on CD 11. Beginning on CD 12, I started getting the blinking smiley face (high fertility) and have continued to get them for the past six days, including today (how I want to punch that blinking smiley right now). This is very strange for me. Usually I get one, maybe two high days, and then my peak.  Even the last time I took Clomid, same dosage, I got ONE high day on CD 13 and then went to peak on CD 14.  The cheapo test strips have been negative this whole time. I did get a slightly darker test line on the cheap test this Thursday, but not the clear, dark positive I'm used to, and the ClearBlue test was still showing \"high\", so I dismissed it as a negative. I should also mention that I've had no CM this cycle. In the past, I have always had some right before I ovulate, and it's quite noticeable. But so far this cycle I've been completely dry.  I've heard that Clomid can cause your CM to become more \"hostile\", but not cause an utter lack of it.\nIn addition to all that, I had an ultrasound on Tuesday (CD 13) that showed three mature follicles at around 16mm.  The doctor told me that I should get a surge in the next two or three days, which would have been Friday at the latest.  Today is Saturday, CD 17. I've never ovulated this late before. Not on Femara, and not the last time I took Clomid.\n\nSo finally, my questions.  Has this happened to anyone else while taking Clomid?  The plethora of days of high fertility blinking smileys?  The total lack of CM?  Did Clomid make anyone ovulate way later than they had in the past (if you ovulated on your own or on different drugs before Clomid, that is). At this point I'm so scared that I ovulated and missed it. I think about those three mature follicles going \"to waste\" and it makes me want to cry.\n\nI know we're not doctors here, and I did leave a message for my doctor asking her about this situation. Being that it's Saturday I'm just not sure when I'll hear back and just wanted to get some input.\n\nUpdate: Thank you so much to everyone who responded and gave me advice/stories of similar experiences.  I ended up going in for a last minute ultrasound yesterday (Sunday) morning.  The ultrasound showed that I had not ovulated yet, but was very close.  The doctor indicated that she thought I should get my peak OPK result yesterday afternoon, but the tests I took yesterday afternoon AND today still showed high fertility...  We won't be able to move forward with an IUI now anyway since my husband is out of town, and will probably use a trigger shot next time around to avoid all this confusion for a second time.
