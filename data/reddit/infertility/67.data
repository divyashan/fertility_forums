Doc said this is due to my lining getting thicker and more clots are passing which means more painful cramping but it will be short lived, and which in fact it was. \n\nAnyway instead of continuing on with another IUI, I decided to move through the additional option he recommended which was doing a lap to remove any endo that seems to be in the way of my fertility. I have 2 options. I can wait until the expert surgeon in New York is available (I live in PA) and she would do an amazing job and attack anything she can, which will leave me as pain free as possible for a long time. Or I can do the surgery with my RE and he will assist with another OBGYN who will do it robotically. And his major focus will be my fertility, increasing my chance of conception.\n\nI want to hear from any of you that had or has endo and were in the trying for a baby part of your life.

I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSo infertility is shit. I get that. However in the last ten months of really \u201ctrying\u201d I have changed a lot.\nBack story is we started ttc feb 2017. I took out the iud and was ready to get pregnant!\nWell in March I did. I did a pregnancy test and the next day I started bleeding...I knew something wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019ll spare the details but eventually we discovered it was ectopic and I did medical management with methotrexate. It took me until July 2017 for my beta to hit zero. In that time we cancelled a big trip to Japan, my grandmother died and we moved across Canada for my work. It was hell. Our first few months in the new province were tough. My husband struggled to adjust to a new job and my job was very demanding. I was always thinking about having a baby and trying to time things but we weren\u2019t doing any real tracking etc. In November I went to my GP and said I wanted to see a specialist to make sure everything was ok after the ectopic. We did some bloodwork and all of it was normal. I got into the infertility clinic super fast and they did the sono and HSG. HSG was normal and on sono the doc said my afc was a little lower than normal but I could do the AMH if I wanted to really know my reserve.\nAnyways not much happened until January. Husband kinda got more on board with tracking things etc. Then in March I decide to do the AMH. It came back as .96. We were panicked. Got back to the clinic and started doing some tracked cycles with femara and met about IVF.\nWe have had no success. Also every month my cycles seem to get progressively worse. In the meantime our best friends got pregnant, his younger brother and wife got pregnant, his best friends wife is pregnant. Several other people around us are pregnant too. Every single one of these pregnancy announcements sent me spiralling.\nFast forward to now. We tried to start IVF in September and had to stop early because of poor response to stims (max dose and hgh). \nDonor egg has come up 3 times in the last few weeks.\nSince September I have kinda collapsed emotionally. Before then it was tough but I could pull it together and was coping ok. Since September I feel like someone else. I have stopped talking to my friends. My very good friend just had a 24 week old baby and I don\u2019t talk to her. I\u2019m sure she could use me as a friend but I have told her I just need space. She is being understanding but I feel like a terrible person. My other friend with kids keeps messaging me and I ignore her. I don\u2019t want to talk to her or see her because she doesn\u2019t get it and I don\u2019t want a pity party.  I deleted Facebook because I couldn\u2019t handle the baby pictures and pregnancy pictures. I also didn\u2019t want anyone trying to look at my profile to snoop and see if I am pregnant or what is going on. \nThis weekend we went to my in-laws house and my baby nephew was there. I love my nephew and enjoy seeing him but the last few times I have seen him I have these mixed emotions. Seeing my sister in law hold him and smile at him sets me off. I was super rude to my mother in law every time she tried to talk to me and I can\u2019t even explain why. It\u2019s like I am mad at her for not needing me to give her a grandchild now and I don\u2019t want her to know how hard I am struggling because she doesn\u2019t need to care now, she has her baby to coo and coddle and love. Meanwhile I had to sneak away at dinner to go give myself my injection for IUI this month that probably won\u2019t even work. \nIt\u2019s messed up. \nMy husband got mad at me this weekend and told me he has to walk on eggshells around me and that I am such a loving person at home but that I act like a total bitch to his family and friends. He is right. I feel like garbage. I also feel like I am so far gone that I am going to isolate him from me and lose my one support person. I am scared he will give up on me and this process. \nLong story short, I am not myself anymore. We aren\u2019t even a full year into this process and I am falling apart. I am scared of who I am becoming and scared that my husband is done with this. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this and at what price to my identity/emotional status.\nI see a psychiatrist every week to talk through things but I don\u2019t know how much it is helping. She won\u2019t give me medication either. I am so uptight and angry all the time it is exhausting. I act like a bitch so people leave me alone because I don\u2019t want anyone to see my suffering. \nI don\u2019t want to be this person. I hate myself.

I've been lurking here for almost 1 year, and I wasn't sure if I'd be allowed to post here because I'm not \"formally diagnosed\" with infertility, but I am struggling with it in a unique way (1 ovary that's very cystic). I have a long story, but I'll try to make it as short as possible.\n\nI lost my left ovary to a massive (33cm) cyst when I was 23. I went in for a routine check up with no symptoms, and it was found. I lost the ovary &amp; tube due to the cyst taking over everything on that side. I was told at the time that I was young, my right ovary was perfectly healthy, and this would have no impact on my future fertility. Fast forward 4 years, and I'm having some pulling/pinching sensations on my right ovary. I go in for a consultation and the doctors tell me it's Mittelschmerz, refuse to do an ultrasound to check because it's \"in my head.\" I was still too young and naive to advocate for myself at this time. 6 months later, I can physically feel the mass when I press on my tummy. I go back in (to a new doctor) and he does an ultrasound and finds a cystic mass blocking my right ovary and tube from view. It turns out to be a cyst, 12cm or so, but they can't tell what it's on from ultrasounds. The doctor tells me I should prepare to lose the tube and ovary, and surgical menopause is a definite possibility. He talked to an RE friend who told him there was no way to retrieve eggs prior to my surgery because it was such a mess in there. I was devastated. I sought a 2nd opinion from a local research hospital's RE team. The RE saw me immediately and performed an U/S. He also could not tell what it was on, but said he would do everything in his power to save the ovary. He gave me a 90% chance of saving part or all of the ovary. To make a long story short, after many weeks of tears and anxiety, I had the surgery with the RE. He saved my ovary and tube. There were 5 masses around my ovary that he cut off (teratomas). He said my tube looked healthy and unscathed, and my uterus was \"perfect\". All  the cysts were benign. He told me there was a possibility that a small cyst could return now that the large masses had been removed. He checked me 3 months after the surgery, and my U/S showed evidence of recent ovulation and no cysts. 2 months later, I had the same pinching sensations and went back to him. I had another cyst! Appx 4 cm. He scheduled me for a laparoscopy and I had it removed. I asked about ovarian damage from surgeries, and he stated that most dermoids are usually surface level cysts, so there's minimal damage to the ovary regarding function after these surgeries if they're done by a skilled RE. He said that dermoids never go away on their own, so considering my history of growing massive cysts, it was better to get it taken care of while it was small rather than letting them get big and cause torsion or take over the whole ovary. He told me that it's likely I'll deal with this again because they're clearly recurrent cysts. I asked about the impact this would have on my fertility, and he said that because I'm still ovulating on my own and my tube/uterus looks okay, my chances of natural conception was \"excellent\". He said I may go into menopause a little sooner than I normally would have, like 3-5 years sooner. However, he's refused to do a full blood panel on me until I try to conceive for 6 months (he did at least cut it down to 6 months instead of 12 due to my case history). Throughout the past year, he has run a few tests on me, but I live in a state that does not cover infertility stuff, so he's been really selective on what he's run (I think) so as to be able to slide things through insurance as surgical consult tests vs. infertility tests (if that makes sense). He has also been pretty positive through all of this because in his words, even though I have a low AMH for my age, because I'm young it's likely my eggs are good quality and \"it only takes one good quality egg\". He has encouraged me to not get too ahead of myself when it comes to IVF because I hadn't really tried to conceive yet, and as of right now everything looks like it could work. He has not been super stressed about these cysts whereas I've been in a tizzy about them. I love working with him because he's so cool, confident, and compassionate that he makes me feel like he's really going to take care of me on the surgical floor and in IVF if it comes to that. He makes me feel like it's going to be okay when I'm in his presence. But when I'm not in his presence I get so worked up and upset trying to predict the future in my head.\n\nAnyway, it's been about a year since this all started, and I've been an emotional mess. My anxiety is so high because I'm afraid that I'll be in surgical menopause before I'm 30, with no chance to ever have kids with my partner. I feel like I'm turning into a shell of my former self- I'm constantly worried, jealous of friends who are having babies, angry at myself, my body, my partner, the world..for no good reason. We want to get married but I keep having these surgeries and it's been hard to plan a wedding with all of this going on. We wanted to wait to have kids until we were married, but now that I feel the pressure to even have a slim chance on our own, we've been trying to conceive for 4 months (2 lazy months so I could wrap my head around the concept of starting before I was \"ready\", and 2 actively timing/testing OPKs). I started seeing an infertility therapist this year after my first surgery, and I'm still seeing her. It helps some days, but now I'm getting more desperate with each negative HCG test and I'm starting to feel that telltale pinching ache on my right side again. I'm panicking that my cyst is back, and it's making my anxiety and depression so much worse. I don't want to hurt myself, but the thoughts are beginning to pop into my head- I've always dreamed of having kids, what kind of life will I have if I can't have them? Do I even want this life? How can I live a life so different from what I always wanted? Etc.. I'm ashamed that I've lost control over my thoughts and that I am feeling this way sometimes.\n\nAnyway, here's the only quantitative data I can provide right now: \n-December 2017 \n-Progesterone checked CD21. Was 2.90 ng/mL. 3.0 was the cut off for \"proof of ovulation\". My period started CD22. Is this bad?\n-AMH: 1.4 ng/mL\n-CA125: 25u/mL \n-CEA: 0.7ng/mL\nSurgery was January 2018\nCycles returned to normal post-surgery.\nApril 2018:\nU/S showed evidence of \"recent ovulation\". RE said I had a \"textbook 'ring of fire'\" on ovary, good blood flow, no cyst. Didn't want to do an updated blood test (AMH or anything- said it was not necessary at this time, was obvious I was ovulating). RE said I had some time to think about family planning, but not to put it off 10 years.\nJune 2018:\nU/S showed small cyst\nJuly 2018:\nLaparoscopic Surgery \nAugust 2018:\nRE did an U/S at my 2 week check up. It happened to be on CD2. He had a med student with him, so he was talking out loud more than usual. He was looking for cysts, but told me that he could see 3 or 4 follicles forming, with one dominant follicle that would be the one probably releasing the egg. Is this close to having a AFC of 3 or 4? He did not say specifically, and I was so stunned to hear the good news that my little ovary was still working to ask. He printed me a picture of my ovary with 2 visible follicles in the picture.\nAugust 2018: Begin \"Lazy TTC\"\nOctober 2018: Begin using OPKs, HCG tests, timing better\nOctober 2018: Starting to feel the pinching feeling on my right side and panicking. I want to make it to December (6 month mark of TTC) to get a formal consult with my RE, I am also dreading more surgeries. I'm afraid my RE will tell me he won't keep doing surgeries on me (for no good reason, he's never said this- just my brain spiraling). I'm terrified to go back in and find out I have another cyst. I'm terrified to do nothing. I'm just scared.\n\nPlease, can anyone help me find anything good in this? Anyone been through something similar? Any advice? I'm desperate and terrified that I'll be in surgical menopause before I get a chance to conceive. Is there good news that I'm ovulating?

Please stick with me.\n\nMy sister had a baby in 2013, Sarah, who I fell in love with SO HARD. I have been an aunt for a while so I don\u2019t know what happened, but Sarah was my heart. I spent any free time visiting her cause I just loved to watch her.... be alive. After a year of this and my family calling me creepy for loving her too much, we decided that my husband and I should start trying for our own. I wanted to be able to love someone to the fullest without people thinking it was weird. So, we started trying the beginning of 2014. \n\nFlash forward a few years, we were having infertility problems. I get surgery and find out I have endometriosis because of some pain (from hell) that I\u2019ve dealt with for years but didn\u2019t know the cause. The infertility continued, we tested my husband with good results and did artificial insemination several times to no avail as well as fertility medications. I tried to not let my infertility consume me.\n\nFebruary 2017 my life fell apart when we found out my sister\u2019s husband, son and daughter (Sarah) died in a plane crash. I loved her husband and son SO MUCH too, but I don\u2019t even know how to grieve three such important people in my life, even now. So far I can only work on grieving Sarah.\n\nMy heart broke that day and my hope in anything died with them. I wanted to kill myself last year, but know my family couldn\u2019t cope with any more loss. My sister was pregnant at the time and has since had her baby girl who has become my life- I truly live for her. \n\nI have six siblings, and the two younger than me both had or are having babies this year. My younger sister didn\u2019t want to get pregnant but accidentally did and had the smoothest pregnancy with a perfect baby boy. They live in our basement to save money, and I hate that the first baby to live in our home isn\u2019t mine. I hate that I feel this way too.\n\nThe past year and a half since the accident- I\u2019ve tried to figure out my new normal. I\u2019ve tried to help my sister and her new baby and with all of the loss. I\u2019ve tried to help my younger sister with her baby. I teach high school and care so much about my students. I volunteer in a grief group for kids that are so sweet and matter so much to me.\n\nLast night I had a dream that my sisters new baby died. I woke up devastated. I realized that I can\u2019t take one more thing. I feel like a game of Jenga that is ready to topple over.\n\nI also realized that everything in my life (aside from my husband) that matters to me isn\u2019t mine at all. I had no say in Sarah going on a plane because she wasn\u2019t mine. And I have no control over the new baby\u2019s life either. Several of my students are going through absolute hell at home and there\u2019s nothing I can do to help. And the kids at the grief group don\u2019t even remember my name- though I very much remember theirs.\n\nLately I have been getting super nauseous when I\u2019m even the tiniest bit tired or hungry. I feel like my body is shutting down, I really do.\n\nI decided not to kill myself last year, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to live. I thought living for others would be good enough because living for myself wasn\u2019t, but I realize I am going to be crushed over and over if I put all my eggs in other people\u2019s baskets. \n\nI don\u2019t want to live in a world without Sarah. Why did I fall so deeply in love with her just to lose her? I don\u2019t want to feel like hell physically and emotionally every day. Not only am I not getting pregnant, but the reason I\u2019m not getting pregnant is causing me immense physical pain, and the fertility treatments have been very expensive. I don\u2019t want to be so attached to all of these things that aren\u2019t mine. I want to be happy. I want to have a kid of my own. I want to feel better. I want a reason to live for me. I want help. I need help. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy and on medication. Without those I\u2019d be dead, but they aren\u2019t enough. What else can I do to survive this? Thanks for reading.

We still had good fertilization rates during IVF, and concentrated on my wife to find reasons for repeated implantation failure.  Having finally identified some likely issues with timing and silent endo, we are in need of creating some more viable embryos again, and started looking into MFI to increase our chances.\n\nWe promptly did another semen analysis, as well as a SCSA DNA fragmentation test.  The DNA frag test came back low at 2% (great!) but the SA showed low morphology and borderline forward progression.  The full results were  4.2ml, 63M/ml, 73% Motile, 2% Morph, 2 Forward Progression.  Additionally, sperm prep numbers show concentrations between 60M and 100M per ML and back up the 2 rating for forward progression.  Our doctors were not phased at all, and said 2% of \\~250M sperm is still plenty.  They did not suggest ICSI, preferring to let Darwin do his thing.  This was confirmed between three doctors at our current clinic, as well as a fourth doctor at a different clinic.\n\nI decided to go see a reproductive urologist for piece of mind, and as I had feared, he found a bilateral grade 2 varicocele.  Still he did not think surgery was warranted, nor prudent considering advanced maternal age, and the fact that we are already doing IVF.  The risks and delays outweigh the potential upside according to him.\n\nSo is that it?  Why cant I shake the feeling that there are other factors, perhaps unknown or unidentifiable factors that are negatively affecting our embryos?   Is it as simple as good DNA + good fertilization rate = good enough?  Am I just searching for problems until I find one?\n\nThe reason this comes to a head today is because we had our sixth retrieval yesterday and had the fewest number of fertilized eggs yet.  I know age is a major factor, and I also suspect possible over-maturation of the eggs since they decided to push the trigger back to get an extra day of stims in, and lead follicles were 24mm, and had been over 20mm for three days.  Anyway, I cant help but think that another retrieval is in our future, and I dont want to be a few months down the road wishing I had done the varicocele surgery.\n\nOur Standard IVF (non ICSI) fertilization rates for all six cycles have been:  69%, 65%, 88%, 100%, 92%, 70%.   Whats more, the few studies I could find regarding IFV outcomes for morphology-only MFI suggest Standard IVF has a slight edge over ICSI in fertilization rates, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.  \n\nConsidering the above, should I pursue additional medical opinions in an attempt to get someone to suggest the surgery?  Or should I leave \"well enough\" alone, and continue to do what I can through lifestyle changes and supplements/coq10?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 10273, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mild MFI Varicocele - 4 Doctors, 2 Clinics, 1 Reproductive Urologist all discourage surgery.

I have a diagnosis of PCOS and am awaiting a HyCosy. My husband is getting his sperm analysis done soon.

For example, even if the child is genetically yours and your husbands you are not protected if the surrogate wants to keep that baby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is - is surrogacy a pretty common outcome for infertility issues? I know it sounds like such an odd question but I saw a show on the TV earlier today about a surrogate keeping the baby in my country and it just had me thinking oh my god what if surrogacy was our only option. \n\nWhat are the reasons for a woman needing a surrogate mother?

First time posting here, but long time lurker / trier at conception!\n\nWe've run 2 IVF cycles this year... The first with 9 eggs, the second with 11...

I'm about to start a third cycle, but I'm feeling like my eggs aren't as comfortable with my age as I am, so we should probably have a Plan B.\n\nI have a sister who is 12 years younger than me.

It's a lot to wrap my head around (like, \"Will it feel like my child?\"), and a lot for her to wrap her head around potentially as well (like, \"Will it feel like my child?\").\n\nMy RE says using a sibling donor is CRAZY common.  So I know there are good stories out there, but  I've searched this forum for stories, as well as /infertilitybabies, and here's the thing... I can't find much.

Got referred to an RE and have been in contact with the only fertility clinic in our province since June.\n\nI'm posting here because I'm having doubts about our RE's competence over several issues, such as testing my wife's progesterone on day 22 without bothering to ask when she ovulated (day 12 that month), confusing us with other people, etc.  If there was another place to go in province, we'd look for a second opinion, but unfortunately that's not the case.\n\nWe're currently unexplained.  Sperm analysis came back normal, pelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, tubes are open, all hormone levels are within a normal range except for my wife's progesterone, which measured at 14.8 (I believe the units are nmol/L).  She's now on letrozole and her progesterone is up to 84, which the RE said indicates she's ovulating multiple ova.  She's still not pregnant, however.  We're now on a third cycle of letrozole 7.5 mg.  We're now waiting on the results of an AMH test, which was supposed to be done earlier but wasn't. \n\nThe RE is starting to hint that we may need IUI if a fourth round of letrozole fails.  This has led me to several questions:\n\n1.  How many rounds of letrozole and timed intercourse would you do under these conditions before going to IUI?  I've heard that statistically, it may make sense to stop after three.\n\n2.  Is IUI even worth it versus timed intercourse?  Statistically, is it worth do the standard three rounds of IUI in this situation?  We won't be doing IVF, so if three IUIs fail, would it be time to consider adoption (our next step)?  Or would it be worth it to try more rounds of letrozole and roll the dice more that way?\n\n3.  My wife has a retroverted uterus, which the RE says is not a factor in and of itself.  My wife is concerned it could be a sign of stage 1-2 endometriosis, but the RE isn't interested in further investigations at this point as she has no other symptoms (though she had very painful periods in her early twenties).  Would you agree with this?\n\n4.  My wife is vegan, had a low BMI and exercised extensively for the first year or so of us trying.  The RE seems unconvinced these things are a factor.  Specifically, he said any claims about lifestyle factors are not \"evidence-based\".  In any case, my wife has since reduced her exercised to walking, has gained weight and cut out soy on her own initiative.  The RE says it would still be fine for her to run 8ks 3-4 times a week, even though it seems to shorten her cycles by 1-2 days.  Yes/no?  \n\n5.  It is very difficult to get answers about our chances.  I've heard the old chestnut that our chances are either 100% or 0%, but I'm more interested in what is statistically likely for people in our circumstances.  Google has turned up a sea of contradictory information, so I'm interested in what people here might have to say about this.\n\nNormally I would address these questions to our RE, but he is very adept at dodging questions and tends to just repeat what he's already told us.  Thanks in advance for any input you might have.\n\n\n  ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 10288, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How bad is our situation?
