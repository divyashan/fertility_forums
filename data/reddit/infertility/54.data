I finally had the HSG yesterday and the results aren't clear cut. I'm hoping the collective wisdom and experience of this group can help me decide what to do. \n\nI spoke with my RE this morning about the results. My left tube is fine, but the radiologist and my RE disagree about whether there's an issue with the right tube.  The radiologist's assessment is that the right tube is fine. My RE thinks that its *probably* fine but told me this morning that he still would 60% recommend getting a laparoscopy to be sure. He then proceeded to tell me how the HSG test isn't always accurate, and he had a patient recently where all three reviewers of her HSG thought it looked normal, but then after another failed FET she had a laparoscopy which showed that there was an infection after all, and once fixed she was able to get pregnant. A nice story, but not super helpful to hear that the HSG test I just waited 4 months to have is essentially useless as a diagnostic tool for my situation. \n\nAnyway, my RE is leaving it up to me about whether I want to try another FET and see if it works, knowing that there's a question mark about whether there's an issue with my right tube that could lead to implantation failure. Or, if I want to go ahead and do a laparoscopy to find out for sure and fix any issue present. \n\nI'm torn because of course I want answers to why i'm still childless. But, I also don't want to undergo a major surgery unless its totally necessary. Those of you who know my history know that i've put my body through a lot of shit over the past 5 years (2IVFs, bad OHSS, ectopic/methotrexate, 2 D&amp;C) and i'm wondering when enough is enough. Can my reproductive parts really take another surgical intrusion? \n\nPart of me wants to skip the lap and do another FET (we have 3 PGS normal embryos on ice), but the other part of me thinks \"what if i'm making a mistake and will be devastated if the FET fails and I could have prevented it?\" \n\nI know the decision is ultimately up to me and my SO, but if any of you have dealt with a similar decision i'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm so freaking tired of trying for a baby and having to think about decisions like this... \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To lap or not to lap (advice needed)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7u1x4h/to_lap_or_not_to_lap_advice_needed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517337356, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7u35xv/tuesday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "id": "7u35xv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 84, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7u35xv/tuesday_afternoon_off_topic_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517390526, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 6, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

After application, you are supposed to sit or lay down for 5-10 minutes. \n\n* The tablet dissolves and leaves a chalky substance in your vagina. I had **excessive** discharge while on Endometrin. Panty liners were an absolute must 100% of the time. Before I knew how bad the discharge would be, I literally soaked through my underwear when I rolled over in the middle of the night. I thought I had peed myself. \n\n* Using flushable, unscented wipes regularly helped to keep everything from getting too irritated.\n\n**Crinone**\n\n* 1 box contains 18 doses @ 2/day = 9 days/box\n\n* 1 box = $254. 1 day = $28.22\n\n* Crinone isn't really a suppository in that it's an applicator filled with gel. The applicator is inserted in the vagina and then a small box at the bottom is squeezed to force the gel out and place it high in the vagina. You do not have to sit or lay down after using.\n\n* The progesterone is absorbed by through the mucous lining and the binding is left. I've seen the texture described as paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9, cottage cheese, or dried white glue. Every couple days, a manual vagina sweep with your finger to remove the binder will help reduce the discharge. I only had to wear a panty liner one day and that was transfer due to the fluid leaking out used to clean the cervix. Some people report no discharge even *without sweeping*.\n\n* I haven't had to use the wipes with Crinone. The second day of Crinone was really uncomfortable for me. My vagina wasn't used to the drying gel and it was irritated. It went away after a day or 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n#Crinonewins\n\nFor me, it's 100% worth it to pay the extra $2 a day and not feel like I'm peeing yourself constantly.

I am pissed at Kaiser and hoping you all might help me frame my letter to my RE. \n\nHere's the (abridged) story - I have Kaiser insurance and went to Kaiser's IF clinic for about a year before my RE recommended IVF (I have 50% coverage for everything but IVF). I chose to do IVF in Mexico, and Kaiser has a strict policy against doing outside monitoring for patients doing IVF elsewhere. So, fine - I got my monitoring at another local IVF clinic. None of it would be covered anyway. My first IVF cycle in Mexico failed and last week I asked my Kaiser RE to retest my CD3 AMH and FSH because they were in free-fall as of 6 months ago and I want that info to help decide how fast to move to donor eggs. They said NO, because I am \"no longer a patient under their care.\" I ordered the tests online and just paid out of pocket, but I'm pissed about it, and I also want to get a hysteroscopy to make sure I don't have any uterine issues before doing another transfer. A hysteroscopy is not monitoring for an uninsured IVF cycle, it is a procedure that I should have insurance coverage for at Kaiser (and only at Kaiser). So I'm worried they are going to try to deny me that as well under the same logic, so I need to push back. Here's what I've got so far, any comments welcome! \n\nHi there, \n\nThanks for getting back to me and clarifying the policy. Is there a written version of the policy that I could review? \n\nI asked my OB and PCP to order the tests, since I'm still under their care, but my OB referred me back to the Infertility Clinic and my PCP never responded. Since no one at Kaiser was able to order the tests in a timely manner, I ordered them myself from an online lab and paid out of pocket, something I really should not have had to do since I have 50% insurance coverage for diagnostic testing related to infertility. \n\nI understand this is not your decision (and I have always been more than happy with your care, which is why you were the person I reached out to), but I do not think that it is a fair one in my circumstances, and I would like to be put in touch with whoever is responsible for the decision and possibly (if needed) to appeal it and become reinstated as an infertility patient at Kaiser (since I have no other options for insured care and would like to pursue additional diagnostic testing after my first FET failed). \n\nMy question/concern is this -- I don\u2019t understand how doing IVF infertility *treatment* at another clinic means that I cannot have infertility-related *diagnostic testing* done at Kaiser, which is my only provider of insured care. Diagnostic testing is covered by my insurance at 50%, whereas IVF treatment is not, regardless of where I purchase services. I should not have to travel back to Mexico and pay out of pocket to receive diagnostic services when I have 50% coverage at Kaiser. \n\nIn other words, I don\u2019t understand how I can be denied insured care (diagnostic testing related to infertility) at my only source of insured care (Kaiser) based on a decision to purchase uninsured care (IVF treatment) elsewhere. \n\nThis feels fundamentally different to me than Kaiser\u2019s policy to not provide IVF cycle monitoring for patients who are doing their IVF cycle at another clinic. \n\nThank you for looking into this and hopefully connecting me to the right person. As I said, I have always appreciated the care you have provided and understand that this has nothing to do with you. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help me write a letter to Kaiser about denying me diagnostic testing after I did IVF at another clinic?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7u4uqz/help_me_write_a_letter_to_kaiser_about_denying_me/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "Lcerrito", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "28F, 4 IUI's, Unexplained"}], "author_flair_text": "28F, 4 IUI's, Unexplained", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517354929, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7u5clf/experiences_doing_egg_retrieval_not_under/", "id": "7u5clf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 40, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7u5clf/experiences_doing_egg_retrieval_not_under/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517414531, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 7, "selftext": "Our RE went over the process for our first IVF, and he mentioned that for the egg retrieval I would be given a local vaginal numbing shot on both sides, a Xanax pill, and a shot of Dilaudid.

I had some light bleeding that day and the day afterwards, and ever since then I've had something that's maybe one step up from spotting, but not even enough to fill a pantiliner. I asked the follow-up nurse about it, because it is day 24 of my cycle and I wasn't sure if it could be my period showing up early or not, and she said she couldn't say--sometimes it causes periods to come early, sometimes late, sometimes weird, etc. It's not regular period blood for me, though, which makes me think it's still spotting.

Has anyone else had unusual bleeding following a hysteroscopy polypectomy? \n\n[This is so gross but I realize that I have no one in my real life to talk to about this other than my husband, who is wonderful, but distinctly unhelpful as he doesn't own a uterus and therefore has no idea what normal is.

This subreddit has helped me tremendously and although it sucks to be here, its the best worst place to be. So thank you all for your endless support.\n\nMy flair explains most of it, but just to clarify on a few things and then my question. I started IVF in August 2017, got 7 embryos, had a fresh transfer immediately after, and then two frozen transfers (single embryos only) in Nov 2017 and then most recently on Jan 18 2018. I did not do PGS testing because when I asked about it, my RE said she typically does not recommend it below the age of 36.  After my first FET, my beta hcg was 65, two days later was 32. My RE said it was probably a chromosomal abnormality, so the embryo was eliminated. My husband and I both did genetic analysis (karyotypes) in January after the second failed transfer and they were normal. My Vit D was originally low and then rechecked in January was normal. So was my thyroid.\n\nSo, here I am. My RE was really optimistic at my first FET, which didn't work. Now I've had my second FET, no dice. My lining is fine, my hormones are fine, the embryo apparently \"looks\" good but certainly that doesn't mean anything. The plan this time is to now transfer two embryos because I've had three failed transfers. RE wants to repeat a sonohysterogram (had one two years ago which was normal) and endometrial \"scratching\" a week before I start my next FET. From what I have read, it seems to improve pregnancy rates, and the risks are minimal. I currently control my cycle with birth control, then use a combo of estrace, endometrin twice daily, PIO at night (lucky me!), baby aspirin, and prenatal vitamins of course. I'm assuming we will do a similar protocol this next time. \n\nMy question is, what else should I be asking them to do? How can I be proactive? Sadly over the years, I have become very complacent and do what they suggest without asking because I feel so defeated. I asked before the last transfer about the ERA, my RE said she has only done it a few times for patients on request and that there are no studies showing it adds a benefit. Anything else? Is hysteroscopy beneficial? Via ultrasound, they have seen a 1 cm polyp, but other than that, nothing. \n\nIf nobody has an answer, that is okay. Thank you for letting me vent and thank you for your suggestions.  \n\nEDIT: thank you for your responses. It seems like a hysteroscopy would really make sense. Some of my test results are not currently available to me so I am going to ask the Doctor about the previous polyp they found. Thank you all so much.

As my flair shows, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2017. Two surgeries and a round of radioactive iodine (RAI) later, I just got decent bloodwork - a TSH of 1 (for the first time in a year!) and a thyroglobulin (Tg) of 0.2. \n\nI have an appointment with my endo next week and I'm trying to prepare. Such a low Tg indicates no more RAI, but when should we get back into IF treatments? All studies say to wait between 6 and 12 mos after RAI to get pregnant, as residual radiation can destroy a fetus' thyroid and cause cognitive and developmental issues. That is a big risk with a HUGE time range! It'll be 6mos in March. Should we start trying then or wait another 6mos?  Thoughts?\n\nSimilarly, this is the first time that my TSH is at an appropriate level. It's gone down to 2.0 before, but bounced right back to 7 the next month. Should I ask for continued monthly monitoring before we start IF treatments again? Should I see consistently good TSH levels for (however many) months before we start? \n\nThoughts? Has anyone else had this issue? How long did you want to get off the bench?

I'm not here to tell anyone what to do, per se, but only make some recommendations about appropriate genetic evaluation versus inappropriate genetic evaluation, and give you some of the info to ask the questions and figure out whats best for you and your choices moving forward.\n\nA couple of definitions first that I think may be helpful in providing context. You may know a lot of this first stuff especially, but it's helpful to give the basics first:\n\n**Genetics 101**: you have two copies of every gene, one you inherited from mom and one from dad. The genes are all spelled out in long strands of DNA using the four letter genetic alphabet. DNA is then wound up really tightly and compacted into 23 pairs chromosomes- 22 regular pairs chromosomes (autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes.  You have DNA in virtually every cell of your body, and that DNA tells the cell how to form and function, with impact on every level you can imagine: from the nitty gritty functioning of that cell, all the way to eye and hair color and how your liver processes waste, etc. \n\n**Genetic vs. Heritable (or inherited)**: there is actually a difference between these two. \n\nA condition that is genetic is caused by something going on in your genes - a mutation in a gene, a deletion in a chromosome, etc., but it is not necessarily something you *inherited*. That genetic change may have happened randomly when you were just an egg or sperm yourself, or in an early stage of embryologic development. Thus, you may be the first person in your family to have it. Now that it exists though, it's there, so you can still pass it on to your own potential children. \n\nMy point is that some people have something running in their family that does (or may) give multiple people risk of infertility or a specific condition. Others may just randomly have some unfortunate gene that decided to drop in on them. Not all tests will detect both of these causes. \n\n**When heritable disease happens**:\nYou may be familiar with terms like dominant and recessive relating to genetic (heritable) diseases. *Dominant* means that only one of the two copies of a gene has to have a mutation in order to cause the disease. That second normal copy is not enough to make up for the broken copy. An example would be achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism) or Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome caused by the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* genes. *Recessive* means that both copies have to be affected in order to cause the disease. If only one copy of a recessive gene has a mutation, the second healthy copy can pick up the slack so to speak. In that case, that person is a *carrier*- meaning they have one bad copy with a mutation, are usually perfectly healthy, but can pass that mutation on to a fetus. In our world, we usually talk about recessive conditions and being a carrier in the context of carrier screening for Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, etc.  The last one I'll mention is *X-linked*, meaning the gene is on the X chromosome, and thus whether or not it causes disease is often impacted by the sex of the person. Think of it like a recessive condition- a female has two X chromosomes, so if she has a mutation in an X-linked gene, her second X chromosome has the backup copy to pick up the slack and typically a girl will not be affected. A male only has one X chromosome plus a Y, which has a totally different set of genes on it. So if a male has a mutation in an X-linked gene, he has no back up copy of that gene, and thus would have the disease. (PLEASE NOTE: there are exceptions to this! X-linked disorders can be very complicated and impacted by other factors. This is just the basics, if you want an advanced genetics primer we can talk about that later)\n\n**There are many types of genetic changes, and thus many tests to look at them. Not all of them are helpful.**\n\nThere are all sorts of alterations that can happen in genes: *mutations* are like spelling changes, *deletions* are like chunks missing, *duplications* are like extra chucks, *trinucleotide repeat expansions* are like run-on sentences, *methylation* disorders are like the bulbs are there but the light switch may be turned off, etc. The language can be very confusing. From this point on, I'm going to use \"mutation\" to refer collectively to any of these alterations. \n\nEveryone has mutations. Everyone. No one is \"perfect\", and cells replicate all the time, so errors will happen -- it just depends what the alteration is, where it happens, and when it happens -- that determines if it causes a disease, a risk factor, or absolutely nothing and no one cares. There is a HUGE spectrum. \n\nThere are common mutations and rare mutations. Generally speaking, common mutations cause either absolutely no problems at all (those are called polymorphisms) or they cause a risk factor, which by itself doesn't do much but if there are other risk factors (genetic, lifestyle, environment, etc.), it can cause problems.  If common mutations did a ton of damage, there would be no more humans. \n\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs or \"Snips\") fall into this category. SNPs are not mutations, in that they, by themselves, do not cause disease. A SNP may be correlated with a disease (\"people with early onset heart disease seem to have this SNP more often than the average person\"), but do not cause the disease (\"he has a mutation in the *LDLR* gene causing Familial hypercholesterolemia and thus he has this disease\"). Therefore trying to look at common or moderately common SNPs is really not that helpful for YOU. You and your doctor are probably not going to change your care much by finding out if you have some common to moderately common thing. However, it is helpful from a population/research perspective. The more we know the better and it can be helpful for learning about the genetics of various diseases, but you shouldn't rely on tests like [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/), which primarily look at the presence or absence of various SNPs, to find out why you have infertility or to help you decide what to do about it.\n\nRare mutations are much more likely to be disease-causing. They tend to be one mutation or change, in one gene or chromosome, that all by itself causes harm, and by \"causes harm\" I mean it can, for example, all by itself cause premature ovarian failure. For example: the *FMR1* gene, when mutated, causes Fragile X Syndrome in boys, but women who are carriers for the mutated form can have premature ovarian failure. That is a helpful answer as to why you have POF, in that it is a clear reason. It may not offer a solution, but it's an answer. \n\nOne example I want to bring up because I get really concerned when it is mentioned on this (or any other) forum, is the *MTHFR* gene. A while back, there were studies with data suggesting that mutations in this gene could cause or contribute to clotting issues, and thus potentially impact miscarriage. However, further studies and massive review of all of the literature shows that changes in this gene are extremely common, and that they are one of many polymorphisms and are NOT disease causing all by itself or even in combination with one or two other things. At this point in time, there is not thought to be any real clinical impact from this gene, and thus no utility in testing for changes in this gene. Both the American College of Medical Genetics and American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology do not recommend testing for this, because most data right now says that it is useless and can even cause problems. If someone really does have a clotting issue, is identified with an *MTHFR* change, and we say \"Oh well we found it! This is why!\" and thus stop looking for the real cause, we could miss something really important if we ignore the data and get distracted by a de-bunked theory. If you are concerned about it, talk to someone in genetics in person and have them re-review the latest literature and talk to you about pros and cons. \n-ACMG recommendations: https://www.acmg.net/docs/MTHFR_gim2012165a_Feb2013.pdf\n-Good overview from Kaiser: https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/Images/GEN_MTHFR_tcm63-938252.pdf  \n\n\nThis stuff is complicated. And there are a lot of companies out there happy to take your money and either tell you nothing or scare the crap out of you for no reason. Here are some things you can do to find information about a potential genetic cause of whatever you're experiencing: \n\n1.\tAsk your reproductive endocrinologist: \"What causes this? Are there genetic causes? Is it something you can test for?\" MOST importantly: \"Would that information help you decide how to manage my care?\"\n2.\tGo see a genetic counselor: Generally speaking, they're nice, well educated people who genuinely want to help. You get a 30 min to an hour-long appointment and they can talk about all of this stuff. You can find one near you here: https://www.nsgc.org/findageneticcounselor There are a few different Types of Specializations you may want to search by: Prenatal, ART, PGD/Preconception. But I would also consider just looking at Adult or some of the more general ones and calling to ask if there is anyone that can talk to you about your specific question.\nAlso, be wary of non-genetics professionals ordering genetic testing. There are some tests that are more straightforward and fine (karyotype or chromosome analysis), and certainly there are plenty of non-genetics doctors who know a lot about genetics and do a good job. BUT, one problem in the profession of genetic counselors is that we end up spending a lot of time cleaning up a mess made by doctors who don't know what they're doing ordering tests they shouldn't order, and not explaining to patients what the test means or the impact it may have. This is like, THE THING that genetic counselors talk about A LOT in private, what a huge problem this is or can be. So please please please, consider asking to talk to a genetic counselor if someone starts recommending genetic testing above and beyond basic chromosomes. \n3.\tConsider participating in research: Look up a study or trial that may help you and or help you contribute to the larger knowledge base. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home \n4.\tGet in the weeds: Proceed carefully here, you may seen genes come up that DO NOT apply to you.  This is a database of genetic conditions, the genes that cause them and the clinical tests that examine them. Again this is a tool for genetics professionals so don't let it overwhelm you or scare you to death. For example, I looked up POF and a bunch of cancer genes came up that I know don't actually apply to POF, they apply to ovarian cancer. So that's a limitation here. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/ \n\nOK that's what I have. I hope it's helpful. It's certainly not everything but I hope its a good basic overview. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Genetics Overview for the IF Community", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7uw8w8/genetics_overview_for_the_if_community/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "benihanacumberbatch", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "36M+35F|UNEXP|2IUI| 5IVFs |PGD| 2 FET-1fail-1MC | FET3=?"}], "author_flair_text": "36M+35F|UNEXP|2IUI| 5IVFs |PGD| 2 FET-1fail-1MC | FET3=?", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517625456, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7uwndd/friday_evening_thread/", "id": "7uwndd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 40, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7uwndd/friday_evening_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517693034, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 9, "selftext": "Hope everyone's weekend is off to a great start!

I'd like to preface this by saying that I know how incredibly lucky I am to have any insurance coverage at all for infertility, and don't want to seem ungrateful or whining - but yesterday was so absurdly overwhelming, I really need to vent to someone. So, without further ado - \n\n**Yesterday over the course of 9 hours, THIS happened:**\n\n1. We went from thinking we were starting IVF #1 as an estrogen priming protocol next month, to thinking we're instead starting an antagonist protocol *next week*, and then back to thinking we're doing EPP next month - all due to miscommunication among the staff at our clinic, and the nurses' willingness to brush aside our questions and just *make shit up* rather than double-check with our RE.\n\n2. As a result of the above, we sat through a 2-hour IVF nursing consult (and I wasted 4 hours of precious sick leave) to learn about *the wrong protocol.* I also wasted hours of time earlier in the week getting price quotes from various pharmacies... all for the wrong protocol. (I hope the meds/doses are similar?)\n\n3. I was told by my insurance company that my specialty medication to treat inflammatory bowel disease (Humira) had been mistakenly billed as an infertility med - and at over $9k per month, I therefore had no fertility coverage left for the IVF I thought I was starting next week.\n\n4. I went from thinking I had $10k of fertility med coverage, to being told I had $0 left, to being told I had **$9,999,999.99** of coverage \ud83d\ude32, to being told that I actually had $20k of coverage, to finally realizing that it doesn't even matter, because however much coverage I have, that's how much insurance will say one cycle costs (\"oh, you have $10k of coverage? Well that's lucky, because that's how much we charge for Follstim!\").\n\n5. While locked in my office at work, I made 8 phone calls to insurance/pharmacies/patient advocate totaling 3 hours and 36 minutes, including an **epic 1-hour-and-54-minute 4-way conference call** with my insurance company, CVS Specialty Care's fertility team, and CVS Specialty Care's autoimmune team in order to figure out what the hell was going on in #3 &amp; 4. I felt like I really bonded with Emerald, Deborah, and Angela, who all agreed that it was \"truly a one-of-a-kind call\" that will go down in history among customer service calls that are recorded for quality assurance. (\"at least this hold music isn't too terrible;\" \"if you really had $10 million, I bet you wouldn't spend it all on fertility meds!\" \"well, it *does* really add up\")\n\n6. Re: #3, 4 &amp; 5 - It seems that when my husband's employer (a very large company) updated their fertility benefits on 1/1/18, \"someone must have coded something wrong\" resulting in all non-fertility meds being billed as fertility meds, and all fertility meds being billed as standard medical care (thus the $10 million/\"unlimited\" coverage) *for all of the employees on that insurance plan*. Apparently out of thousands and thousands of employees and dependents on this plan across the United States, I'm the first person on specialty medication for a chronic condition to also inquire about IVF meds in 2018 - so I was the lucky unicorn tasked with catching the error and spending nearly 4 hours on the phone until someone could figure it out.\n\n7. Unbeknownst to me, my patient advocate at our secondary insurance company spent the entire afternoon fighting for me on a completely separate issue - getting my clinic and the insurance company to sign a contract allowing me to proceed with treatment at all. Supposedly they're going to sign on Monday (after two months of getting my hopes up and then dragging their feet), but either way, the insurance finally gave us their word - in writing - that we can proceed!\n\n8. When I finally got off the phone last night and drove home from work (where I didn't get much work done at all), Mr. Exposure Therapy and I drank one and a half bottles of wine and drunkenly wrote a list of all of the miscommunication issues we've had with the staff at our clinic (which we're going to clean up and present to our RE the next time we see her). We planned to spend the rest of the evening coloring copies of the \"FUCK\" page from our [Swear and Relax adult coloring book](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Sick-This-Swear-Relax/dp/1530049121) (gifted to us by the illustrious /u/mackiemouse), but we accidentally passed out on the couch before we could get to it.\n\n**TL;DR Having a medical condition is a full-time job.**\n\nIn summary, literally everyone that I spoke to yesterday is expecting me to call back on Monday to rush-order my meds and start monitoring... but due to the confusion over our protocol, start date, and coverage, I now have to call them all back and sheepishly say \"never mind\" for another full month! I guess if there's any silver lining to yesterday, it's that it brought to light a bunch of financial/insurance issues that we weren't aware of, and we now have an extra four weeks to figure it out.\n\n\nSo... Could anyone tell me what we'll actually need for the estrogen priming protocol?\n\n(Edit: typo)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "On false starts, and how I almost had $10 million in infertility coverage", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7v0h3m/on_false_starts_and_how_i_almost_had_10_million/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "tanglin01", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517681118, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7v0wve/postmediocre_ivf_transfer_blues/", "id": "7v0wve", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7v0wve/postmediocre_ivf_transfer_blues/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517747292, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 10, "selftext": "Hello everyone, my profile is over 40, 8% success rate predicted per cycle, third IVF transfer, with only one normal appearing embryo.

I have endometriosis and have been operated in 2014 on a chocolate cyst on my left ovary.  The ovary has been spared and so was my left tube.\nSo yesterday I had my foam echo. It's a method that does not hurt like a normal hsg does. \nI was very nervous, because the day before the echo I had very painful intercourse with my husband. It felt like a new spot of endo has formed on the outside on top of my uterus. When the internal echo was put inside me, I felt exact the same pain.  But the foam echo is such a relief if I compare it to what I have read about hsg. You only feel menstruation cramps during the moment they fill your uterus with the foam. For the average endometriosis patient normal menstruation cramps are nothing. \nEnd result: my left tube is closed. My right one is open.  According to my gyn I have to undergo a laparoscopy again. \nOh well. I just felt like sharing my story. Does anyone here have got experience with the foam echo? Is it true that most people are more fertile in the months after a treatment like this? And stories about clearing the fallopian tubes via laparoscopy are also welcome. \n\nDon't mind my spelling. I don't know all abbreviations, I'm Dutch. \n\n\nEdit: I don't think that the foam echo is very well known abroad. I have copied a Dutch text from its discription of a Dutch hospital (fertiliteits kliniek twente) and ran it on Google translate. \n\nFoamecho The foamecho (schuimecho) is a quick way to demonstrate the patency of the fallopian tubes. It is a vaginal ultrasound examination in which the inside of the uterus and the fallopian tubes is made visible by leading foam into the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes. On the ultrasound image, the course of the foam is visible as a white discolouration. This echo takes place in the first half of the cycle and your possible fertility treatment can usually continue. The research With the foamecho you have an empty bladder, a speculum is inserted and a thin tube (catheter) is inserted into the cervix. The speculum is removed and a vaginal ultrasound is inserted. The foam is slowly injected and continued with the ultrasound. Injecting the foam can cause some light menstruation-like cramps. Afterwards, there may be slightly slight bleeding and / or some foam back. The doctor will discuss the findings directly with you.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Foam echo: hysterosalpingo foam sonography experience", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7v2io2/foam_echo_hysterosalpingo_foam_sonography/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "massiveteeth", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517702956, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7v37yv/a_nonprofit_is_hosting_a_strollerfriendly_5k_race/", "id": "7v37yv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 90, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7v37yv/a_nonprofit_is_hosting_a_strollerfriendly_5k_race/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "2JTsx1MBWPDC7CP2V2s_dze5-gePW2esWwM78VCHsPk", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VKpjDVRYE5lrc619g2_NPAY7VfUQhlnwzQZu26BSzXA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=6664f55677bdf36dd7ca6ed5ab9030da", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VKpjDVRYE5lrc619g2_NPAY7VfUQhlnwzQZu26BSzXA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=66c5c38f04095a00df8fed08255b05a3", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VKpjDVRYE5lrc619g2_NPAY7VfUQhlnwzQZu26BSzXA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e0852863e356a92c75fbe937a7433c75", "width": 320}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VKpjDVRYE5lrc619g2_NPAY7VfUQhlnwzQZu26BSzXA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=f800527b0b174b4a6d836158a8c82634", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 800, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VKpjDVRYE5lrc619g2_NPAY7VfUQhlnwzQZu26BSzXA.jpg?s=ef4eb198c7e2e7b5610a9602a4f97b54", "width": 800}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1517771380, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 53, "selftext": "Link to the flyer (with pictures of children plastered all over it): https://instagram.com/p/Bev8ETWjRxJ/\n\nI don't know anything about this nonprofit but I can't take them seriously at all.

I was told that this was a total fluke and we should do the same thing for round 2. Because we're 100% out of pocket and I asked repeatedly, we will get $4,500 off our next cycle with this RE. Great news, but something didn't feel right about doing it 100% the same way again. \n\n In January, I got a second opinion with another RE who disagreed. She thinks I have poor egg quality because I have very high testosterone (thanks PCOS) and it's making the eggs crappy. She suggests doing ovarian diathermy to control the hormones, then doing a second round of ivf a couple months later. This would hopefully produce way better eggs, making the whole process better. \n\nMy question is: Am I ~allowed~ to have the ovarian diathermy with RE #2, and then go back to RE #1 to do our discounted cycle? \n\nI have no idea if this is against some sort of medical rule, and honestly I don't want to call either clinic to ask, in case they get pissed off that I'm bopping around for the sake of money. \n\nI would be perfectly fine just asking RE 1 to do the surgery, but that clinic doesn't do it. \n\nAny insight or advice you all have to offer would be greatly appreciated.

It was weird because it was an email clarifying details for the shower...but we never got the original invite. Hmm, okay. \n\nAnywho, I'm slightly masochistic, so clicked the link to their registry and I was SO annoyed with a few items on there and the little cutesy messages about why it was needed from the parents-to-be. Nursing shirts and scarves for mom (okay, not totally out there), a Doordash type gift card because \"sometimes we want food but are too tired to cook\" (eye roll), a food list sign-up for everyone to make them homecooked meals (now you're starting to piss me off) and a $350 6-person tent because their old one \"is only built for two\" (retch). \n\nI was dumbfounded--you're having a baby, so your friends need to make you dinner and buy you new hobby gear? I know, I'm being Judgy McJudgerson over here. I'm PMSing, what can I say? I think it annoyed me the most that the couple sent this out--not a family member/friend. I may be old fashioned, but usually meal sign-ups and other manual labor is offered and organized by a friend, not solicited by the couple. But, whatever. Not my movie. \n\nTo make ourselves feel better, Mr. Bot and I started joking about how we should start an infertility registry. Why should people with babies on the way get all the goods? It brought us a few laughs, so I thought I would share. Feel free to add on! I'm not even in active treatment yet, so I'm sure you all have even better ones to add!\n\nOur IF Registry:\n-Multiple copies of \"Taking Charge of your fertility\" (to rip up and/or burn). \n\n-Cozy socks for gyno visits \n\n-Loose boxers for Mr. Bot (let's not boil that sperm)\n\n-Porn magazines, not from the 80s, for SAs (Mr. Bot's idea, haha)\n\n-A subscription to Avocado of the month club (another addittion from Mr. Bot, my is he witty!)\n\n-Body armor for the next person who tells me to take a vacation or relax\n\n-10 sessions of couples counseling\n\n-An all expense paid trip to Hawaii (the magical, baby-making vacation everyone talks about)\n\n-A gift card for an accupuncturist/herbalist (it won't cure our infertility, but at least it will shut up people who ask if I've tried it)\n\n-Toys for our dog (our stress makes this wannabe big sister a little anxious, and when she's anxious, she needs to chew on something)\n\n-Take out gift cards (because sometimes we want food and are too tired to cook too, like 99% of other Americans I imagine).\n\n-A house cleaner (the crushing depression of IF, along with chronic pain that never existed before this, sometimes makes me too exhausted to clean my house)\n\n-A new puppy (cuz puppies are cute and make me happy)\n\n-Wine (so much wine)\n\nEdited: I just wanted to add, I don't normally scrutinize my friends' registries and I don't begrudge anyone a gift. I love celebrating my friends and family. I've had a rough week of pain, losing our cat, and extreme PMS. I know I don't need to explain any of this to y'all, but I felt like I should. I'm looking forward to the day when baby shower invites don't throw me into a tizzy.

I thought I\u2019d let you know my story so far - it deals with OHSS and my symptoms or lacktherof!\n\nFirst round of ivf was this month, after 2 years of trying. Both me and my husband are 33, he\u2019s got some dna frag and antisperm antibodies, I had extremely long cycles (40-50 days) and couldn\u2019t prove I was ovulating so here we are.\n\nAnyway ivf for me was injecting gonal f in the evenings and cetrocide in the mornings. Ladies who fear injections I was shocked at how easy they were! \n\nIn fact, I was surprised at how easy it was generally. The first week I was fine, no moods, no pain, no bloating ... just fine! I did start to have a low level sick &amp; headachey feeling but nothing unusual for me. \n\nSecond week they started to scan me- mon &amp; wed, and I was definitely feeling sick by now so I mentioned it to the nurses, but my main concern was the fact I wasn\u2019t in any pain or had any bloating - I was afraid it wasn\u2019t working. By Fri however I was feeling crappy all round and let the nurse know! She was surprised I wasn\u2019t feeling bloated cause low and behold my ovaries were 10cm each. \n\nIt turns out they were big because I had so many follicles, they had to cancel the fresh transfer due to fear of ohss! Ovarian hyper super duper syndrome or whatever it\u2019s called. I was so disappointed! Instead of getting my transfer in a couple of days I now find out I have to freeze any blastocysts we get and wait a cycle or two til my ovaries calm down.\n\nAnyway, today I had my egg collection and after the procedure while coming out of the sleep I heard the nurses talking about me, they were wondering why I hadn\u2019t rung them up to let them know I wasn\u2019t feeling well? \n\nWell let me tell you ladies, my symptoms were nowhere near as bad as a bad period. I\u2019ve had worse pain with a migraine. This just did not rate on my pain monitor as serious - but I want to say to anyone else going through this: pay attention to your body! Nausea and shortness of breath - however mild are SERIOUS. You need to let the clinic know straight away. Even if it\u2019s just a little sick, even if it doesn\u2019t stop you from eating, even if you\u2019re drinking gallons of water every day - let them know.\n\nWe now not only have to wait an extra couple of months but pay extra money for the frozen egg transfer. \n\nOn the plus side I got a yummy dinner of burritos made by my husband so you know, every cloud. \ud83d\ude09  Seriously though I hope this helps someone, I read everything I could get my hands on about ohss and ivf I just didn\u2019t realise I had it. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ivf, ohss and FET- my acronym heavy cautionary tale story so far!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7vi575/ivf_ohss_and_fet_my_acronym_heavy_cautionary_tale/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "CountingSheeep", "author_cakeday": true, "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "29F.

Be gentle.\n\nI have known there was an issue with my reproductive cycles since I was 15 (I didn't get my first period until a month before my 16th birthday), way before I ever started trying for kids. Everyone told me it was all in my head and once we started trying it wouldn't be a problem. \n\nThen once we started trying people said its all in my head and I need to stop worrying and once I quit worrying I would get pregnant. You guys I have only had 16 periods in 2 years. Presuming you get one period a month I'm basically short a year. Only 6 periods in 2017. In the past I went 192 days without a period. I'm currently on CD 80. But yes that's all in my head. \n\nAnyways, my fiance and I have been trying for a year and a month. I started seeing an OB for blood tests and such in July but she wont do any intervention until I have been seeing her for a year. When doing my tests I was officially diagnosed with PCOS and had some abnormalities in my blood that she wasn't practiced in, so she sent my file to an endocrinologist, but she did sorta explain and it could be some sort of early onset issue. This was in November, my appointment is finally here on the 8th. I feel like Im going to explode and am so anxious about what tests I'll have to do. \n\nAny of you guys have calming down tips and tricks? Any expectations? P.S. The abnormality was high hormone 17. I dont remember all the lingo she used as she was talking very fast and using her doctor words but it could be early onset something.\n\nThanks for listening guys, sorry for the funky writing style.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Endocrinologist after a year of trying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7vkv9m/endocrinologist_after_a_year_of_trying/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "witt41", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517892023, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7vkxy5/ivf_advice/", "id": "7vkxy5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7vkxy5/ivf_advice/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517950502, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 7, "selftext": "Here's my story thus far: \n\nI have always had problems with my periods and have been on the Pill since I was 16. Several years ago, my OBGYN told me I had ovarian cysts and 1 of them became calcified. I thought...NBD and very UNLIKE me, I never even looked up how serious cysts can become. \n\nWell, I got married in July of 2016, and with the biological clock ticking (I'm now 35), my husband and I knew we'd want to start trying right away. Fast forward a few months later and one of my problems from the past reared its ugly head- I started bleeding between periods again due to the cysts. She wanted me to come in and take a blood test. The results came back with a high CA-level, and after the gynecological oncologist appointment, it was decided to remove the cysts if possible and the offending ovary, if needed, since there would be no way to tell if the cysts we're cancerous or not until a procedure or surgery was done. I thought, Hey! I've never had problems with the right ovary, and my mom had all 3 of us with just one, so I'll get that left b!tch outta me and be pregnant shortly thereafter. When I woke up I received good news along with devastating news. They had to remove the whole ovary and at least it wasn't cancerous (it was a very small chance it was in the 1st place), but endometriosis had swallowed up my right ovary...we can't get pregnant without IVF.  \n\nI had NO IDEA I had issues on the right side. Maybe I would've waited for the left ovary surgery, maybe not, but I definitely would've asked if we could try to save eggs from the left  ovary after its removal. I sobbed. And was grateful it wasn't cancer. And sobbed again. \n\nFinally, I made the IVF appointment. After hearing my story, we got more bad news...he gave us a 99% chance of failure if we tried to use my eggs, and now we need a donor, but...do we really?\n\nCan we try to salvage the eggs I have in the right ovary that are trapped by the endometriosis by removing it entirely? The doctors told me the right ovary would have to come out eventually, anyways.\n\nIf we really do have to use a donor, isn't there a better way to find someone other than using an agency that charges you $15K and more? We even thought about posting the \"job\" on Craigslist and holding interviews, doing our own background checks, etc. \n\nThanks for reading and sharing info.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IVF advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7vkxy5/ivf_advice/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "SuziQ14", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517895472, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7vl8r7/another_metformin_post/", "id": "7vl8r7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/7vl8r7/another_metformin_post/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517953019, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi friends,\n\nLong time lurker, seldom poster here.
