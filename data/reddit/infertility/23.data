You can also input some statistical information about yourself, e.g. your age, height, weight, and infertility diagnoses, and see how likely IVF is to work for you.  \n\nhttps://creatingafamily.org/infertility-category/understanding-the-new-fertility-clinic-success-statistics/ is a podcast that was posted to my clinic's Facebook page this week (and features one of my doctors!) that's helpful in understanding and interpreting this new data. \n\nTake a look. \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New SART Success Statistics", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4gab3l/new_sart_success_statistics/"}, {"author": "treacheroushuevos", "author_created_utc": 1426309651, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "40F, TTC 5 years, no tubes, FET#1 failed, one embryo left", "author_fullname": "t2_m5m9p", "created_utc": 1461536994, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4gadx0/happy_pet_parent_day/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4gadx0", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 62, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4gadx0/happy_pet_parent_day/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "DsOE4RM0xISotLGjZOTbiNGZIaj5sPAWKvfOEBcApPc", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=07a62381ad684e3f2511790efdd2c4cd", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=14fe6583e0251b221ce1e5ed499c1d7b", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=5c48e1ac8d5642d0e0796e5fbd219c1b", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=7e7f907ce4325b5b5949b4dbe59337e4", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=97573c40b641c6cc2cd749bf1bf87d47", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=6d2826ff9fbf27e08e99015db9f9483d", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 2592, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/e3aTn2hAUbmI_JmIVwZ9LRW7qgxxwT_0sg-v6Zlw9Wg.jpg?s=cc9a8716f0e9755c1770f2886e5760a7", "width": 4608}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1463571278, "score": 15, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I didn't even know this was a thing, but I guess it is.

Been trying for 21 months, started fertility treatment in February.

The last 3 months I have not had any sore breasts and I even been taking progesterone supplements.  After seeing follicle scans my guess was I was not ovulating before starting treatment.  Month one I did Clomid and got a follicle but tiny 17mm on CD21 so I'm not really sure I even ovulated so I guess I didn't think to much of it.  This last month I did Femara and got a beautiful 26mm follicle at day 14 and triggered and felt ovulation.  I was expecting sore breasts but again nothign even with progesterone supplements.  \n\nDoes anyone know why for like my whole life I'd have sore breasts 8dpo and now nothing.  I guess I always thought sore breasts were a good sign that things were semi working right.\n\nAgain all that's changed is:\n- Metaformin\n- Dexomethasone\n- Add Femera (Clomid for 1 month will be Femara now)\n- Ovidrel\n\nIs there such thing as too much metaformin?

I got a call from my doctor at 11 AM saying that the doctor scheduled to perform my surgery - who has been with my practice basically since its inception 20 years ago - announced today that he will be leaving the practice.  I haven't the foggiest clue of what's ultimately behind this, although I imagine it's some sort of professional drama that I ought not to concern myself with.  My understanding is that this doctor may be moving on to be a solo practitioner or will be joining a new practice.  Either way, it put a wrench in my plans for a consult today, not to mention the actual surgery I'm supposed to have in three weeks.  My doc's voicemail simply said to call back and that we would reschedule the surgery \"as soon as possible\" with \"another surgeon.\" \n\nW.\nT.\nF.\n\nMy some stroke of luck, I started a period over the weekend (a couple of days before I thought I would) and also needed to have a CD3 monitoring appointment scheduled today.  The doctor leaving the practice is always in on Mondays, and initially we were going to lump my monitoring appointment and the consult in together.  The consult got cancelled, but I was advised to keep my monitoring appointment on the books and still come in at 3:30 today for a blood draw and ultrasound.  I walked into the office nearly in tears unsure of what I was going to say to the doctor who I felt this morning was leaving me high and dry.  \n\nIt was a very lucky monitoring appointment.  Leaving-the-practice doc asked me how I was when he walked in, and I said, \"If I may be frank with you...I'm very worried about when or if I'll have this surgery now and on what time I'll ever get around to a frozen embryo transfer.  I'm really feeling like I've been through enough already...I'm so sorry for whatever's happening, but the news today had me very upset.\"  Doc was super, super sympathetic.  \n\nAnd he thinks that we may be able to finagle a few things and get me in next Thursday...two weeks *before* my surgery was initially scheduled.  \n\nWe also spoke with my doctor this afternoon, and she asked to keep her posted in case an update doesn't come through her inbox tomorrow from a scheduler or a nurse or whoever.  She promised that at the very latest I'll still have this surgery with someone on or before May 18.  ANYWAY.  \n\nWe did do a bit of a mini-consult while we were having a look at my ovaries on the dildo-cam.  Essentially, recovery will be pretty quick and doc thinks that if I wind up having surgery next Thursday, a long weekend off will be sufficient and I'll be back in action with my students by the following Monday!  The plan is absolutely to completely remove my diseased-or-whatever tubes, but that if there is significant scarring and my tubes are actually stuck to my ovaries we'll clip them instead to make sure ovarian tissue isn't damaged.  The discussion was very straightforward and reassuring - we just need to make this happen.  \n\nI'll update tomorrow with a when, a who, and a how for this thing...I hope!

Thanks in advance for reading.  I feel so alone sometimes with infertility.  I've only told immediate family, and I feel like I always have to put on a brave face in front of them.  But infertility sucks, and it hurts, and sometimes I don't feel hopeful.  It's nice to tell my story to others who get it. \n\nMy husband and I tried for over a year when my general physician suggested I see a fertility specialist.  We went three days before Christmas 2014, and the doctor talked to us about all the reasons we might not be getting pregnant.  He suggested I do an HSG that day to rule out any issues with my tubes. He seemed confident everything would be fine, so I sent my husband back to work and went to the test later that afternoon. I knew something was wrong when I heard the doctor talking in hushed tones with the nurse. It turns out that both my tubes were blocked. My whole life changed that day. We later learned that it was due to a severe infection I had as a child (4 years old) after my appendix burst. Since then I have had two surgeries, first to try to open my tubes (didn't work) and then a second time to ligate my right tube because of a hydrosalpinx.  \n\nIt's been 18 months and we finally moved on to IVF. We went last week to our information session, and I am excited and terrified. It was so much information!  I remembered this sub existed, and I have been reading your posts and getting informed.  I hope to be more than a lurker.  It is awesome to have a community where you don't feel so alone.

See convo below. She's \"S\" for stranger.\n\nS: So do you have kids? [she says this after being completely unprovoked by me.. I don't ask that question to people anymore]\nMe: No.\nS: No, not yet huh?\nMe: We can't have kids. [My husband and I have found that this is the best response.. people usually shut up after that.]\nS: Oh, I'm sorry.\nMe: It's okay. We have almost 8 nieces and nephews though.. my sister is due in June with her second. [Trying to deflect conversation off of myself.]\nS: Haha, that's great. 8 nieces and nephews is enough kids for you, right? [with a little laugh]\n\nThe game goes on and I was relieved that I got out of that conversation unscathed. Then...\n\nS: So, how long ago did you guys find out you couldn't have kids?\nMe: After we'd be trying for a year, about a year ago, we were diagnosed with unexplained infertility. We had tests done, but they've all come back okay. We don't know why we can't have kids.\n\nThis is when the barrage of bingoes starts.\n\nS: Well, I've heard that lots of people have kids if they just stop stressing about it. [Bingo #1].\nMe: Yeah. Well this has been a hard process of getting hopes up and then being disappointed, so we're pretty much done trying. [this was my subtle way of saying SHUT UP]\nS: You never know, maybe years down the line it'll just happen! [Bingo #2, riiiiight, because in several years I'll have better chances at that age???]\nMe: Yeah. I think we're done.\nS: Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Maybe you're supposed to be a big part in other kids' lives.

UGH.\n\nMy husband was super sweet. We went and got ice cream, because what's more American after a baseball game than getting ice cream from the local ice cream stand? and we end up in line between two pregnant people. He said, \"Do you want to eat in the car?\" And he also said, \"Sorry that conversation happened.\" He gets it. \n\nTl;dr Miss Helpy McHelperson (who I've also never met before) bingos me not once, but FOUR times in one conversation.\n\nEDIT: Obviously the person downvoting this post doesn't get it either.

Here's what I currently have. Please let me know if anything is factually incorrect or sounds too snarky. I don't want to turn people off so I'm trying to make this a gentle, but firm blog post:\n\n\nA few weeks ago, I posted a lengthy \u201ccoming out\u201d about my infertility. I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. I\u2019m lucky to be a person that has such an insanely amazing support system. There are women and men that feel utterly alone during this process - even isolated from their own significant other. It is such a stigmatized situation that they don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing their problems and feel it will be dismissed by most of their friends, and even their family.\n\nThis being National Infertility Awareness week, and me being my oversharing, in-your-face, let-me-tell-you-how-I-feel-about-everything self, I\u2019m going to share a few misconceptions about infertility. I don\u2019t claim to be an expert - just another seemingly \u201cperfectly healthy\u201d person whose body doesn\u2019t seem to know how to conceive a child.\n\n\n\n1. \u201cInfertility is caused by stress.\u201d Infertility can cause a tremendous amount of stress, but stress does not cause infertility. One of the first things people are told when someone finds out a couple is struggling is to \u201cjust relax.\u201d It\u2019s the unfounded, unhelpful gift that just keeps giving. Often it doesn\u2019t matter how many counter arguments a person gives - whether they are a woman who is in pre-menopause with limited egg reserve, a man with zero sperm count, or a couple who has some combination of symptoms - someone will still tell them that *relaxing* will be their cure. There\u2019s not many other medical conditions (besides perhaps chronic stress or anxiety, and even those are generally treated with prescription medication) where a person is told to \u201crelax\u201d to fix a problem. When a person dealing with infertility hears this, they take it as a complete dismissal of their very physical problems. If I do anything else today, I hope that I will stop at least one person from ever uttering this to a person in fertility treatment ever again.\n\n2. \u201cInfertility is a woman's disease.\u201d This simply isn\u2019t true. Of infertile couples, 30% are due to female factor, 30% are due to male factor, and 30% are due to both individuals of a couple. There\u2019s also couples who literally have \u201cunexplained\u201d infertility. On paper, everything looks \u201cright,\u201d but they still cannot conceive. This is why we need to break the stigma of discussing this subject - because even medical studies are limited. Just last night, I attended an AMA with two doctors who focus on male factor infertility. Despite being on the bleeding edge of infertility studies, their testing requires hundreds of thousands of sperm cells to test. This is not going to help couples who are dealing with male factor infertility where the counts are drastically lower. Additionally the tests are entirely unfeasible for women as even the most fertile of women would produce less than 75 follicles per cycle when stimulated. This is obviously nowhere near the threshold of *hundreds of thousands* of cells needed. The science just isn\u2019t there for either sex.\n\n3. \u201cFertility treatment always leads to multiples.\u201d At its inception, fertility treatment did often lead to multiples. Originally with the medication that was prescribed women, would over-produce follicles (each which releases a single egg and can potentially split into multiples). Once a woman would ovulate, they would ovulate all of the mature follicles and then - voila - conception of multiples. Today, doctors take much higher precautions. They will cancel treatment if a woman is over (or under) responding. I personally have requested an increase in my treatment and my doctor has stated she does not want to move forward in that path because of my height/size. She has concerns that I would have a very high risk pregnancy if we were *too* successful. Multiples, particularly large sets (think quadruplets+) are very rare now in treatment. It's much more common for treatment to not work. Even in an IVF cycle where a woman is able to produce and retrieve multiple eggs often end up with none to implant.\n\n4. \u201cFertility treatment = IVF.\u201d Fertility treatment is not one size fits all. Those of us in treatment like to think of it as a slow climb up a high mountain. We take one step at a time and rule out potential causes through testing and incrementally more aggressive treatment. It starts with ensuring that a couple has all the necessary elements required for timed intercourse. A couple will have to try several cycles with monitoring and then move forward to IUI (insemination), then possibly IUI with injectables (shots for higher follicle count for the woman) or medication for men (to increase sperm count), and then finally IVF with some combination of drugs. Of course there are reasons why a couple would go straight to IVF - if they intend to use donor sperm/embryos, if there are male factor issues requiring surgery, if a woman has had previous ectopic pregnancies and lost her fallopian tubes and thus as no option but egg retrieval. The point here is that every single couple is slightly different, and there\u2019s not a magic path to treatment or pregnancy. And all of these things take so. much. time. and can be easily halted. I\u2019m currently \u201con the bench\u201d because of a huge cyst on my right ovary. There is quite literally nothing I can do about it until my body resolves this on its own. It can be so time consuming and just plain frustrating. I have no idea how to describe it otherwise.\n\n5. \u201cInfertility only affects older couples or couples who just aren\u2019t meant to be parents.\u201d This is a particularly brutal line of thinking for a couple in fertility treatment. Modern medicine has brought us a long way from dying of the common cold or a simple infection. When you have a fever, do you just wait it out? If you had a major issue (cancer, heart disease) would you just \u201cleave it to God/the Universe/chance\u201d? I personally choose to believe that God did not personally coat my insides with endometriosis so that I could not bear children. I was not given PCOS or a hypoactive thyroid because I would be a terrible parent. I have a lot to offer as a mother and desperately want the gift of having a child. I choose to believe that there is not a higher power stopping me from doing so, and I hope that no one would would think such ill thoughts about me or anyone seeking fertility treatment.\n\n6. \u201cAdoption is an easy solution.\u201d I touched on this a bit in my last post about being your own advocate with medical care. Domestic adoption in the US ranges from $15,000 to even $50,000. International adoption can be more cost effective, but it has its own hoops to jump through. Many countries (and even some US States) don't allow LGBT couples to adopt. Hell, some states won't even allow an unmarried couple to pursue IVF. If a couple *can* go through IVF, it is similarly expensive: base price without insurance is around $15,000 but quickly climbs to the $25,000 range. And this is for a single cycle - the first is typically diagnostic and often a 2nd, 3rd, 4th round of IVF is needed. Touching on point 4, IVF is not the same for everyone. Your baseline IVF procedure is limited medication and allowing \u201cmother nature\u201d to do its job in a petri dish instead of a human incubator. It increases from there. ICSI is where a medical professional literally picks out a single sperm and implants it into the egg. PGS testing is where they then scan for genetic anomalies to ensure they don\u2019t implant a blastocyst (fertilized embryo) that will likely fail due to genetic factors that the body will essentially reject and miscarry. All of these extra tests are drastically more expensive. No road for a couple struggling with infertility is cheap or simple. They all require hard decisions and a huge amount of financial hardship.\n\n7. \u201cInfertility can always be fixed.\u201d  Many people try to help by making suggestions: go to acupuncture, get drunk, go on vacation, stop drinking, cut out carbs, go vegetarian, stop drinking coffee, eat pineapple (the eat pineapple thing is not a joke - it is an old wives tale that regularly comes up). I assure you - anyone in fertility treatment has discussed their lifestyle with their doctor and asked if there is anything they should change. Any time they are put on new medication, their doctor is going to tell them exactly what the should and should not do with their diet and exercise. Furthermore, the serious issues infertile couples are dealing with likely *aren\u2019t* going to change from a simple adjustment of their diet. Again, my endometriosis has nothing to do with what I eat or drink. I\u2019ve also had a lot of friends tell me things like, \u201cI know you\u2019ll get pregnant when the time is right,\u201d or, \u201cit will happen when it\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d Their hearts are in the right place, and I appreciate any support I receive. Sadly these are also statements that undercut the struggle I\u2019m in and ignore the fact that I may not ever have children. A couple can statistically be a slam dunk in the infertility world and it just still. doesn\u2019t. work.\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019ve told you a lot of misconceptions here. If you\u2019re still with me, thank you. And if you\u2019re now asking yourself, \u201chey, CBE, you just told me everything *not* to do, but what can I do to support my friend who is struggling with infertility?\u201d then you are already an awesome person. Here\u2019s my best answer:\n\nListen. Ask them how they are feeling and see if they start to give you more details. Some days, they will want to talk about it (and maybe even give you a TMI level of detail about their reproductive health) and some days they won\u2019t because it will just hurt too much to discuss. I know it can be tempting to say things like, \u201cit will happen for you,\u201d but try not to. Couples struggling are already dealing with so much of their own mental and emotional uncertainty, pressure from their families, and to be perfectly honest, envy when it seems everyone else around them is pregnant. They may not still have that same steadfast certainty that you do. They\u2019ve been dealing with feeling broken for months or years or decades, and the change in your verbiage is very simple. Instead say, \u201cI hope it will happen for you. I support you in your journey.\u201d That\u2019s all you have to do.\n\n**Edit:** It's up here: https://buyingababy.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/35/\n\nIf you would like a link to the facebook post, please PM me.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Misconceptions about infertility", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4gompx/misconceptions_about_infertility/"}, {"author": "Sunbrewed", "author_created_utc": 1426618148, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "PCOS and MFI (Morph), IVF #1 Pending ", "author_fullname": "t2_mauhj", "created_utc": 1461767710, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1461797254, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4goqsy/first_stepscompassionate_care_income_requirements/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4goqsy", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4goqsy/first_stepscompassionate_care_income_requirements/", "retrieved_on": 1463578047, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I just got our First Steps results and we were eligible for a whopping 5% discount.

My husband (39) has had several SAs, but I am not certain what his numbers are because they don't tell us and he isn't a big advocate for himself. I do know number and motility are average to low and his morphology is bad. I wasn't an advocate for myself either really until coming here and realizing all the things I should know but don't. \n\nBefore the last IUI the neither the doctor nor the nurse told us we were supposed to have sex a couple days before the procedure. I thought the complete opposite that like with a pap or something you were supposed to abstain. So this time we tried, but my husband gets so anxious he can't get or maintain an erection. I know it is the anxiety of sex because he has been masturbating regularly. However, he does have low T which also complicates things. This is one reason I am feeling discourage. I feel like it will fail this time too because we don't didn't have sex. \n\nThe other reason I feel discouraged has to do with my RE being an asshole. When I went in for her to monitor my follicle growth, I asked her if there was anything I could/should do to help make this IUI a success. She told me I to lose weight. This is the first time she has said this. I stared at her with a loss of words before finally stammering I can't really lose weight before Friday. It was just a shitty thing to say because it is impossible to do before this next IUI, and I just feel like I am too overweight for it to work. And I am just so angry because if losing weight is what I needed to do to get pregnant, I wish she would have told me, oh I don't know, last year when we first saw her or in November when we went back to really start treatment, or before she took my money for the first IUI. \n\nI am just feeling so upset and alone and depressed.

Lost one pregnancy at 20 (didn't know I was pregnant) and another at 24 right after I married. This loss was devastating. I lost at 12 weeks and 5 days, after hearing the heartbeat. My husband (35M) and I went to the fertility clinic in 2012 where the usual endo etc was found on me, and sperm antibodies were found for him. This explained a lot. We were not able to pursue IUI as recommended at the time due to huge financial constraints. Husband was also convinced since we conceived before, we could again. Have just gone to the clinic for a second time and completed all of our testing. \n\nHere's my dilemma. The new semen-analysis showed no sperm antibodies, and his semen is completely normal. For myself, one tube is now blocked, and possible PCOS. My doctor wants to begin IUI at the end of May which we are super on board for......but the husband has been laid off since October. 400 resumes later and nothing. The economy in our location is horrific right now. We can't exactly afford to do this, but we also can't afford not to.

I feel petty everyday for not being able to be wholeheartedly happy for my my friends or colleagues who are pregnant, and its like i'm never allowed to be sad. I'm also terrified. I'm terrified we will bring a baby into a less than ideal financial situation, terrified to lose another one (while there are 2 confirmed im pretty sure of 3 more), and terrified IUI wont work. Doesn't help that my husband's stance on our lost baby is to \"get over it\" because 6 years later I still commemorate the day we lost it, and my due date.

I should back up a bit and explain one of my unmarried cousins moved back to his hometown a couple of months ago because he thought his girlfriend was pregnant. Well she wasn't. So she was actively trying to get pregnant to get him to stay in their hometown. Whatever.

I don't know where they are going to get money or insurance to take care of a child but whatever. Anyway, she just found out she IS pregnant and my aunt is over the moon that she is going to be a grandma. She is about 6 or 7 years younger than my mother so I can kind of see why she would be a little jealous.\n\nUnfortunately, things got a little heated between her and my husband. I do see where she is coming from in her sadness and disappointment that she doesn't get to share role that her siblings do but I explained that we were doing all that we could. We have been ttcing for the past 5 1/2 years so trust me when I say WE ARE trying our hardest! She understood that but my husband was mad that she had come to the house to sulk and deliver the news about my cousin's girlfriend.

Here's what I wrote:\n\nThis week is National Infertility Awareness Week (\u202a#\u200eNIAW\u202c) and the theme for this year is \u202a#\u200estartasking\u202c. I'm not sure I love the hashtag because there are lots of things not to ask when it comes to fertility (e.g., why don't you have kids? When are you planning to have kids? What about a sibling for your child? Whose fault is it? Why don't you just adopt?), and certainly don't go up to a stranger and ask about her womb. However, the logic is that the experience of going through infertility won't improve unless we start talking about it. As a society, we need to start talking about infertility even though, and especially because, it's an uncomfortable topic. It's uncomfortable because it's taboo, because it's not normal to talk about it, and because people don't know what to say.\n\nEvery day, I see someone on Facebook announce a pregnancy or a birth, which is super exciting and wonderful. However, like other things people share on social media, we only post about the good. What we don't see is what it may have taken that couple to get to the point of making that beautiful Facebook post. 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility. That's A LOT of people! Chances are, many of these posts you see on Facebook are from couples that went through this struggle. Even when couples get to the point of announcing their good news on Facebook, it doesn't mean their struggles are over; they can still feel the sting when others post their announcements or talk about spacing their kids 2 years apart from each other (because it's not something everyone can choose or control), and they worry about what it's going to be like when they try to further grow their family. Unfortunately, because no one shares this information, infertility is incredibly isolating. It can feel like you're the only one not getting pregnant, like no one in your network understands your pain, like you are less of a woman (or man) than everyone else. When 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility, it's mind boggling that we all still feel so alone.\n\nEveryone going through infertility is different, and some may not want to share, which is okay. What's not okay is when people don't share because they feel like they can't, or that they won't be supported. It is an incredibly emotional journey, and I hope you'll accept the challenge to #startasking with compassion and understanding.\n\nAll this being said, it's important to talk more openly about infertility, but I'd advise you to follow some general guidelines about how to talk about it. Saying the wrong thing, even with good intentions, can make someone retreat into isolation and prevent them from sharing again. You may be surprised that something you think is comforting and helpful actually comes off as insensitive or hurtful- I didn't realize this until it affected me. Unless you're a medical professional (a Reproductive Endocrinologist in particular), there's nothing you can do or say to make infertility go away, so my best advice is to not try and offer suggestions or anecdotes about what might help. There aren't hard or fast rules about how to talk to someone who is struggling with infertility, but here are some general guidelines that can help tremendously (and a hug goes a long way).\n\nNext week there will be lots of posts about Mother's Day, but this week, it's National Infertility Awareness Week. I know it's uncomfortable. Ask anyway. Talk about it. Learn what you can. Don't avoid it. #startasking #niaw \u202a#\u200e1in8\u202c\n\nhttp://www.resolve.org/national-infertility-awareness-week/25-things-to-say-and-not-to-say.html\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gulp- I outed us on Facebook yesterday to speak out about NIAW.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4gzsqi/gulp_i_outed_us_on_facebook_yesterday_to_speak/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1461943950, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4gzx9l/it_could_always_be_worse/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4gzx9l", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4gzx9l/it_could_always_be_worse/", "retrieved_on": 1463583403, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "\"It could always be worse!\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4gzx9l/it_could_always_be_worse/"}, {"author": "Sunbrewed", "author_created_utc": 1426618148, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "PCOS and MFI (Morph), IVF #1 Pending ", "author_fullname": "t2_mauhj", "created_utc": 1461945141, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4h00qx/it_could_always_be_worse/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4h00qx", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4h00qx/it_could_always_be_worse/", "retrieved_on": 1463583448, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "What is it that makes people think that phrase is comforting to someone dealing with infertility?

I don't think I've ever been this excited for a period to start before, I almost wanted to cheer lol. \n\nMy question about birth control is what time of day should I take it? Background on my birth control experiences, I took birth control on and off for about 2.5 years when I was 16-18 and had no side effects. When I was put on birth control for my last SIS (25 years old and 2 years ago) it gave me a constant migraine for 2 weeks before they pinpointed the cause and switched me to a lower estrogen pill. I still got some headaches but not migraines and not constant (I took these at night). I didn't have any reaction to the estrogen patches during IVF so I'm not positive it was the estrogen in the pill. \n\nFor this SIS I have the progesterone only pill (the mini pill), should I still take it at night to head off any possible symptoms? I'm better at remembering pills in the morning but could set an alarm or reminder for the evening. \n\nAnybody have a reaction to the estrogen in BCP and do better on the mini pill? I should only have to take it for 10 days so I can push through if I do have a bad reaction. \n\nI'm so excited to be getting the ball rolling on this FET.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Period started (big sigh of relief) SIS is a go, question about birth control.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4h1w5g/period_started_big_sigh_of_relief_sis_is_a_go/"}]}
