I told him that i didn't, not until recently when i found this subreddit and found people who understood what i was feeling, people who've heard all the insensitive comments i've heard, people who like me refuse to go to baby showers after they become too much to handle. He laughed and said that he got a comment the other day that almost made him cry, and then it hit me. He was going through the same thing as me, i wasn't alone but for whatever reason i didn't think he was feeling the same things i was. I should've known better because his dream has also always been to have kids of his own. We were both suffering because our dream was becoming less of a reality. \n\nWe are doing better now and we are trying to reconnect, which involves talking about everything, including how much we hate the fact that we can't conceive a baby and how much we hate comments such as \"have faith\" \"why don't you just adopt\" \"God will make it happen\" etc etc etc So if you're in a position like mine, make sure to talk to your SO, don't make the same mistake i made and assume he's doing better than you.

My remaining ovary already has a small cyst on it and is not well. In addition, I have multiple fibroids. In summary, I cannot get pregnant on my own, and if I want to do it, I need to do it now (IVF). Recomendation is full hysterectomy, incuding remaining ovary due to combination of factors. I am not interested in the heartache involved with going through IVF. I do not have the money for it (I live with my parents due to finances as it is) and I am not interested in going it alone.

Women With Four or More Kids \nA single child is understandable. Two is ok. Three is actually quite nice. But more than four is contributing to overpopulation.  What are you trying to do?  Show the world how fertile you are?\n\n2. Pregnant Complainers\nYOU CHOOSE THIS PATH-unless you are a rape victim.\nOh, you vomiting for hours on end?  You should have thought that through before you got pregnant.  Your feet are so swollen you can barely walk?  There are African tribal women who still carry water for miles and are pregnant and DON'T complain.  YOU - stop.  Not sleeping well? Well welcome to night shift life and crying each night because of your broken body.  And your other kid(s) is so demanding right now. And you look like you\u2019re carrying triplets. I\u2019m sure it sucks. Wanna trade? Here. Here\u2019s my infertility. I\u2019ll take your pregnancy complaints.\n\n3. Unplanned \u201cOops\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t even try! No fair.  Don't complain to us.  Unless are you were raped.\n\n4. The Pregnancy Expert\nEach pregnant woman is different.  Just because it worked for you doesn't mean it will work for us.  And don't assume that we haven't considered everything possible.  We have.\n\n5. The Woman Who Gets Pregnant Her First Try\nI am so happy that your eggs and his sperm are super sperm and eggs.  Fine you are VERY fertile then.  Don't flaunt it.  \n\n6. Teenage Moms\nHonestly.  It is unfair that someone immature and unprepared can get pregnant so easily.  Be that as it may don't complain to us.  You should have had a solid birth control in place or else you are not ready to be having sexual relations yet.  I waiting until I had a stable job and marriage before I considered a child.  I could be a better mother than you ever could. \n\n7. Deadbeat Parents\nWhy did you have kids then.  You should know what you are getting yourself into.  I think pretty much everyone hates a deadbeat. But seriously, you don\u2019t even deserve the title of parent. \n\n8. Women who claim they are infertile\nWhen you ask how long they tried before they conceived, they reply with 3 months.  Seriously.  Have you been through pain for 4 plus years of trying, shots, negative tests, scans, blood draws, crying, and constant questions of when are you going to have kids?  \n\n9. Baby Killers\nAside from the fact that you violated many laws any news or story of some heinous human being dumping their newborn in the dumpster, or flushing them down a drain, or throwing them out of a high-rise, don't deserve to reproduce.  If you have a baby that you don\u2019t want, I WILL TAKE HIM/HER. No need for first degree murder, aggravated manslaughter, second degree murder, etc.\n\n10. Yourself\nMost of all you hate your own crappy body that doesn't work.  Even though you can be a tough non girly girl in real life, there is something about not being able to do the most basic feminine thing of creating life.  You begin to think that maybe your body won\u2019t ever work. Or that maybe you\u2019re just not meant to be a mother. Or that you have some seriously terrible karma and you wonder what you did that was so bad for this to be your plight.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "10 Things That Drive Me Crazy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/56kmyi/10_things_that_drive_me_crazy/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476007363, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/56lm08/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "56lm08", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 71, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/56lm08/sunday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1480215069, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I was feeling reasonably fine, just a very mild cough. Plus I have extremely mild, exercise induced asthma. Yeah, not on Monday. While trying to bring me out of the anesthesia, I went into full bronchial spasms. They had to pump me full of muscle relaxant to stop the airways closing off, while simultaneously trying to put me back under. I was completely paralyzed, and about three quarters awake. And freaking. The. Fuck. Out. Anyway, about 12 hours later they managed to stabilise me, and I woke up in ICU, still intubated, still panicking, and desperately trying to get that fucking tube out of my throat. The staff were simply wonderful, I have to say. They helped calm me down, and after they confirmed that I could breathe on my own, I was extubated and allowed to just be on oxygen. Now 48 hours later, I am fine, and itching to go home... however... all through the panic and the terror, I held tight to the fact that they managed to get seven eggs before it all went to shit. Seven! It was amazing and I was thrilled. Then today my doc came in and said that only two had managed to fertilise.\n\nTwo, I know, is incredible- all I need is one, and I have two, and they are strong and thriving right now. But I can't help but feel completely devastated, like something I did meant that those other five didn't have a chance. I am terrified that they won't stick, and that I will have gone through that nightmare for nothing.\n\nI spoke to the anaesthetist today and he said what happened was extremely rare, and just an unfortunate set of conditions that combined to give me a massive asthma attack while under the anaesthetic. He said I shouldn't be worried about going under again if I ever needed to, because it's incredibly unlikely to ever happen again. So that is good at least.\n\nAnyway, there wasn't really a purpose to this post, I just needed to get it out, and process. Hugs are most welcome, as are sticky thoughts and prayers.

That is incredibly sweet of you :) So\u2026 my infertility is because I\u2019m basically running out of eggs. I have what\u2019s called diminished ovarian reserve, or premature ovarian failure. It\u2019s a genetic thing that somehow caused my ovaries to age faster than me, so my ovaries went through my egg supply too fast. My uterus is totally fine, though, so if I wanted to I can use donor eggs or embryos when I\u2019m ready to have a baby (I\u2019m hoping around 3-5 years from now, but there are 50 and 60 year old women who do this and are totally fine.) I rarely ovulate, and if I do, the doctors said the eggs would be so bad from being \u201cold\u201d that they won\u2019t be viable to become an embryo. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. \n\nI did want to offer you some ideas though, if you are super into surrogacy - there\u2019s some good info on this website (http://www.circlesurrogacy.com/surrogates/surrogates-requirements-faqs) about what surrogacy requires and all that comes with it.

I was so excited when I found out since the fertility clinics in Seattle were charging almost 1,000 for it! I'm going in this afternoon to get my HSG, kind of nervous about the pain since I've heard mixed results on how bad it can be.  Going to take some Aleve before and brought some to take after.  Luckily I'm going in at 3pm so I can just go straight home afterwards and relax for awhile. \n\nWe also have some other good news, I found a place about 30 minutes from us that does 2 IUI's for $2400 &amp; the 3rd is free if the first 2 don't work.  The price covers everything (meds, ultrasounds, appts, etc) and is very reasonable.  Assuming our HSG comes back with no blocked tubes that is going to be our next step. I feel so much better to actually have a plan.  We're going to start saving money now and I'm hoping by January we'll have the money to pay for the 3 IUI's, so I really hope by early February we'll be getting our first IUI! If my tubes are blocked we've looked into a clinic in NYC (We're in Seattle) that does IVF for $3900 for a cycle.  This would still be cheaper if we got plane tickets, hotel, etc than the $18,000 most places are wanting around Seattle.  If tubes are blocked and IVF is our only choice then we will start saving for that I'm hoping next summer is when we could start IVF#1.  In the mean time I'm going to work on losing weight and will continue with medicated Femara cycles and timed intercourse and who knows, maybe we'll get an almost free baby in the mean time that doesn't miscarry, but I just feel really good to have an actual plan.

His sister and her husband tried for kids for 5 years before deciding to see a doctor about it (sorry if that's any of you all but that's something I've never understood) and found out immediately that MFI was at play. They underwent one round of IVF, and from it successfully conceived and birthed a child. Our friend had shared his sister's story with us earlier this year, long before we had a DOR diagnosis or a failed IVF under our belt. Here was the post:\n\n\"Oct 11 2015 was egg retrieval and fertilization day. Exactly one year ago today the cells that have become my perfect, wiggly smiley baby were put together on a path where for me, the divine and the scientific intersected. I woke up from the anesthesia at about noon and as soon as I realized I was in the recovery area I had to let the tears out. I laid there in pain, with bruises and collapsed veins in my arms from all the blood they had taken from me the week leading up to that day, a tender abdomen with evidence of 20 or so needle pokes from the round of stimulation injections, once lime-sized ovaries that had quickly blown up to the size of grapefruits - creating a brutal fight for space in my lower back, an empty bank account, a mind filled with crippling fear and a heart full of nervous hope. \n\nJimmy Fallon, who struggled with his wife for years to have children, said in a People magazine article about infertility, \"Do whatever you can. Don't quit. Whatever you can do, keep doing it. Because it's so worth it.\" \n\nThanks Jimmy. I wanted to quit. But thanks to those words in my head, a few loyal supporters and the most steadfast husband ever, I didn't. And you were right.\"\n\nThe friend sent us this and said \"thought you guys would appreciate this post from my sister, but didn't want to tag you on FB\"\n\nMy husband responded quickly with \"Definitely. Thanks for thinking of us. I had no idea about Jimmy Fallon, but I agree with his sentiment. One day, we will share our story.\"\n\nI, however, did not respond. My husband asks me in bed that night if I saw the text and why didn't I say anything. I was like, well fuck. Because I hated almost everything about this.\n\nFirst, the things that I do like. I like that my husband's friend is thinking about us and shares things/stories that he finds comforting. I appreciate that she had to undergo IVF and that sucks.\n\nThings I don't appreciate: \nThe complaint about her swollen ovaries. Our friend knows that my body failed to respond whatsoever to stims and yielded only 1 non-viable egg. \nThe talk about wanting to give up. You did one procedure and it worked the first fucking time. What are you even talking about.\nThe fact that everything you described as horrific is exactly what is supposed to happen. Horrific is when things don't go well and you don't wind up with any viable eggs, much less a live baby 9 months later.\nThe Jimmy Fallon quote. Dudes, I disagree with that completely. Some people do not need to do \"whatever you can do\" to get pregnant. Some people can't afford to financially or spiritually or emotionally. Not everyone will have success at the end of this journey, I don't need a fucking celebrity to tell me about how \"worth it\" it is to have a child.\n\nI'm glad my husband is a sweet soul who completely missed all of this upon reading it and saw it simply as a token of support from his friend. But I could not and I think I did the best thing to just not respond to the text. If he only knew how much time I've spent being upset about this text he would probably feel terrible. I know he was just trying to help. I need you guys to remind me that my response isn't a crazy, shitty asshole response to have to this. \n ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just trying to work through some feelings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57hlmc/just_trying_to_work_through_some_feelings/"}, {"author": "ImHereReluctantly", "author_created_utc": 1460746311, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "34F, MFI, Clomid+IUI (Fail) IVF+ICSI, FET#1 - MC", "author_fullname": "t2_x79zq", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476471967, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57i3p6/im_back_and_it_fucking_sucks_tw_mc/", "gilded": 0, "id": "57i3p6", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 26, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/57i3p6/im_back_and_it_fucking_sucks_tw_mc/", "retrieved_on": 1480233662, "score": 19, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Again, trigger warning, miscarriage\n\nLate yesterday afternoon I had a bit of spotting.

Off to the ER (it was after hours for my clinic, and they don't have any on call doctors outside of business hours).  After a really long uncomfortable pelvic exam and two ultrasounds, all signs of my pregnancy were gone.  It happened so quickly, I am still in shock and haven't really slept.  My husband is very upset - we had to do IVF w/ ICSI because we are dealing with a severe MFI only, as far as we could tell.  I hope our WTF appointment will shed some light on this theory.  His first reaction is to think maybe he was never meant to have a child.  That broke my heart even more.  We knew going into our marriage that natural conception for us was impossible, and even with science, it might not be possible.  I didn't marry him for his ability or willingness to make a child with me.  I'm trying hard to make sure he is OK too and not worried about things like that.

She seems interested in kids whenever we see them, and she's so gentle.\n\nIt hurts to see her do so well with kids because I feel like her true bff is yet to be, the child we can't yet have.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Even the sweet moments hurt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57o4u9/even_the_sweet_moments_hurt/"}, {"author": "MoonIsMadeOfCheese", "author_created_utc": 1438446794, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "28, TTC 3 yrs, PCOS, IVF, FET1: negative, FET2: MC, FET3: soon", "author_fullname": "t2_p8jpi", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476581658, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57p9vf/i_came_out_on_facebook_today_cross_post_from/", "gilded": 0, "id": "57p9vf", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 30, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/57p9vf/i_came_out_on_facebook_today_cross_post_from/", "retrieved_on": 1480237580, "score": 70, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "This is what I posted this morning (replaced husband's name w/ SO):\n\n\nToday's date, October 15th, holds a very new meaning for me this year. It is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day, and although I rarely share anything personal on Facebook, I have decided that it's the perfect time to tell you all my story.\n\nToday, after 3 years of battling infertility, I should have been 12 weeks pregnant. I was supposed to be planning a cutesy announcement to tell you all that SO and I were happily expecting a baby in April. But sadly, 12 very painful days ago, I found out that I had miscarried and that this journey would only be getting more difficult.\n\nSome of you may already know this, but SO and I have been trying to conceive for nearly 3 years. In 2013 we built our house with plenty of space for a family, and were SO excited to start trying once we got settled in. It never really occurred to us that it would take more than a couple of months.\n\nAbout 8 months after we started trying, I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, which makes it nearly impossible for me to ovulate. I started taking some medicine that was supposed to help, and we continued on. Several months and a few invasive tests later I was put on a fertility drug called Clomid, which gave me plenty of horrible side effects (intense hot-flashes, anyone?) but after 5 miserable cycles, I was still not pregnant. Last August, we finally decided to consult with a fertility specialist, who told us that we would likely never conceive without In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). We were devastated at the expense, but at least we knew that we had a plan. I was scared to go through all of the tests, the hormones, the daily injections, and the constant stream of doctors appointments, but we knew that it would all be worth it in the end. In February of this year I underwent a painful egg-retrieval procedure so that we could start the IVF process, and in May we transferred 2 frozen embryos. We were convinced that it would work...but it didn't. It was hard knowing that even this level of medical intervention could fail, but saw it as a sort of trial run for next time. We took a bit of time off this summer, but I started again with the injections, hormones, etc. in preparation for our 2nd frozen embryo transfer this past August. We just KNEW that our 2nd round would work, and I even did extra things such as acupuncture to boost my chances. At the end of August, we were elated to find out that the transfer had worked, and we were officially 4 weeks pregnant! After the crappy journey that had taken us here, we both knew we needed to be cautiously optimistic, but the fears died down after we heard a healthy heartbeat, and we began to really dream of the future for this child. I started thinking about a registry, was excitedly looking up nursery decor, and we even put a deposit down on a daycare. Everything was finally on track!\n\nThe morning of October 3rd, at a routine ultrasound, four words changed my world forever. \"There is no heartbeat.\" Four words, and everything SO and I had dreamed of, everything we had gone through these past months, was all for nothing. At ten weeks, our baby had died. Sitting there in the doctors office, listening to options, and walking out into a waiting room full of blissfully pregnant women was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I had a surgical procedure the next morning, and just like that, I was no longer pregnant.\n\nI wanted to share this story with you all, not for pity or prayers, but so that you hold your babies a little closer tonight and think about what this horrible day represents. I want this story to make you thankful for the sleepless nights up with your kids, for the dirty diapers and the cancelled plans. Because there are people out there who would do anything to stay up late holding a crying baby, instead of staying up all night crying for the baby they will never get to hold.\n\nI wanted to share this story so that you would think twice when you ask someone why they haven't had kids yet, or ask when they plan to start trying. It hurts when you ache to be a mother with your entire being and some stranger won't stop pestering you about your biological clock, or tells you how selfish it is to be childless. I want you to realize that a mother of a toddler may desperately WANT to give her child a sibling but simply cannot (secondary infertility exists too). I want you to realize that it's not always that easy. Trying to make a baby is not always fun. No amount of \"just relaxing\" will give an infertile woman a child when even miraculous medical intervention has failed. Even the most innocent questions can cause a tremendous amount of pain for someone struggling with losses or infertility.\n\nStatistically, 1 in 4 pregnancies will end in a loss. For some reason, people tend to sweep these losses under the rug, hide their pain and their stories as if they were in some way taboo. But I want to break the silence and start a conversation. 1 in 8 women in the US suffer from infertility, and yet most of us never speak out about our condition, afraid that our stories might be viewed as shameful. Afraid of being perceived as flawed. But I personally believe that suffering in silence is unnecessary, and feel that the support I've gotten during my struggle has been priceless.\n\nI know that our loss happened relatively early, and I'm sure it cannot compare in pain to stillbirth, infant death, or even later-term losses. But this baby was real to us, and so very loved and wanted. This journey has taught us both a great deal about ourselves, about our marriage, and about our respective internal strengths. SO has been an amazing support system throughout all of this, learning to give me shots, and helping me cope with the physical and emotional side effects of the process. His dedication and empathy have made me hope, more than ever, that he will finally get to become a father someday soon.\n\nWe will do another round of IVF in a while and hopefully it will all work out in the end...but I will always remember this pregnancy, and the baby that we never got to meet. I know that SO and I are young and healthy and that statistics are generally in our favor. But the journey sucks, and it's painful and overwhelming and outrageously expensive. I'm just hoping that sharing this will make things a little bit better...for myself, and for all the other couples out there struggling with this painful reality and the heartache it brings.\ninfertility #miscarriage #october15th #pregnancyandinfentlossawareness #hope", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I came out on Facebook today (cross post from r/ttcafterloss)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57p9vf/i_came_out_on_facebook_today_cross_post_from/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476602404, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57qflb/httpswwwredditcomrrelationshipscomments57qci2my/", "gilded": 0, "id": "57qflb", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/57qflb/httpswwwredditcomrrelationshipscomments57qci2my/", "retrieved_on": 1480238210, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57qci2/my_30m_wife_30f_with_infertility_is_refusing_to/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57qflb/httpswwwredditcomrrelationshipscomments57qci2my/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476603010, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1476605156, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/57qgg9/wife_30_f_refuses_to_see_pregnant_friends_its_too/", "gilded": 0, "id": "57qgg9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/57qgg9/wife_30_f_refuses_to_see_pregnant_friends_its_too/", "retrieved_on": 1480238222, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Wife (30 /F) refuses to see pregnant friends, it's too painful.
