I am in no pain and have no other symptoms. We had unprotected sex recently but we haven\u2019t been having sex often because we are both scared of the coronavirus.

He has trauma related to a previous marriage, and pregnancy is a very, very sensitive topic for him, and obviously our DB is caused by it. (Warped view on sex because ex wife thought having sex everyday was how you get pregnant, and he felt that\u2019s all he was good for- it\u2019s been 8 months since it resurfaced and we\u2019ve had sex once)\n\nWhen we first decided to start trying for a baby around our wedding day (and obviously right before his trauma resurfaced) I noticed some problems with my cycle. Over the past 8 months I\u2019ve been to countless doctors visits (alone), and at one point they thought the only possibility was a tumor because my hormones were so out of control. They\u2019ve since ruled out tumors, but the bad news is, I\u2019ve been told it will be increasingly difficult to have children (I\u2019m 28 rn).\n\nThe past month has been rough, because I can\u2019t exactly be open with my husband about my fears and health issues since he has so many mental blocks already around it. I\u2019m trying not to rush his healing.. but at the same time I\u2019m on a literal countdown. I feel I will resent him for the rest of my life if I am patient for a few years and then lose my chance entirely to have children.\nBut then again, I love this man and can\u2019t imagine having a family with anyone else. \nFor the most part things, outside of sex and not being able to discuss a future family, are good. I\u2019ve been able to separate myself a little more from the sex issues since it\u2019s mental health related, but it\u2019s still hard.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s not a lot of people with this exact experience, but looking for any advice on how to approach this.\nI\u2019ve emailed our counselor to see if I can meet with them on my own. During our sessions, it\u2019s a very \u201csupport each other through anything\u201d approach but I feel conflicted. In the back of my mind, I\u2019m wondering when I should go if things don\u2019t change.\n\nAlso this wasn\u2019t an issue when we got married, he talked about children constantly and we wanted to start a family soon mostly because of him. The trauma resurfaced when we started living under the same roof.\nIf he didn\u2019t want children, it would\u2019ve been a deal breaker and I wouldn\u2019t have married him. (Not because I don\u2019t love him, but because that\u2019s something I want in life)\n\n*Edit: he was used basically as a sperm bank before, and that\u2019s not what I want to do or for him to feel that way. But I also want a family, specifically with him.

Married. No children. I have one sister that's 4 years older, with 2 healthy children. I had my first miscarriage in November 2019 when I started bleeding out at about 6 weeks. I found out I was pregnant again in February and had a silent miscarriage at about 6 weeks and 2 days. Due to Covid-19 I couldn't have a D&amp;C and took Mistoprostol to bleed out. Went through 2 weeks of physical and ongoing emotional pain as many of you probably have. For a few days I was convinced that I couldn't bring myself to try for a baby any longer and that I wasn't strong enough to go through something like that again. This was surprising for me because I've had a roller coaster of a life and have gotten through so much (won't go into details.)\n\nMy Dr. had me do complete blood work 7 days ago (17 vials of blood.) I was drained but hungry for answers. Of the tests, 8 have come back normal, 1 has not. I tested positive for 2 copies of the MTHFR C667T mutation. Haven't spoken to my Dr. yet as he said he'd call me once all of the blood work arrives. \n\nI've googled and read through the different studies and tests that have been done. One study resulted in no correlation between the mutation and recurrent miscarriages. A different study shows a correlation. I'm worried. I want and need facts at this point to keep sane. I'm not only worried about being able to carry to full term if my Dr. prescribes Folate, injections, etc., I'm also worried about the possible Neural Tube defects as well as the possibility of Spiina Bifida. I've tried to look for a percentage of these defects resulting from the mutation and haven't been able to find anything. I feel like if I had these factual percentages, my husband and I would be able to come to a resolution and a decision of what to do with our lives. Do we try again? What's the likelihood of a recurrent miscarriage? What's the likelihood of a defect? I don't want to spend a large chunk of our marriage trying for a baby  with so much uncertainty although I love children. I want a peaceful path for us. I want to have a direction to go by and I know that have the percentages will help us decide what to do.   \n\n\nAt this point, it's a waiting game till we hear back from my Dr. But, I'm hoping that someone here may have some similarities/answers/stories for us.

We are going for a modified natural cycle I suppose. \u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months ago I read about Progesterone in Oil shots and brought this up to my doctor and at the time she insisted they were barbaric so I just took her advice and went through with the ERA using her suggested way for meds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nERA: Did ERA with Ovidrel Trigger shot followed by 2 times a day vaginally Endometrin &amp; Estrace taken orally in the morning and nightly inserted vaginally.\n\nAt the same time I did ERA I did an endometrial\u00a0biopsy. This came back positive. I was immediately put on Orilissa while waiting for HSG and CA-125 test results. The HSG showed I didn\u2019t have blocked tubes but I did have like a tissue growth, which she is now calling Adenomyosis. We are waiting to get a hysteroscopy to remove and biopsy to make sure.

This now has me in a whirlwind because as stated above the PIO in the study was better than just vaginal inserts.

I don\u2019t know where to turn or what to do.. a little backstory. My wife and I have been trying for children for children for almost five years.. Shortly after we got married she first told me she was pregnant.. We were elated and over the moon immediately.. Unfortunately about a month after her positive pregnancy tests (multiple) she called me crying telling me that she was having cramping and was bleeding.. We went out to doctor where they confirmed what we had feared, that she had miscarried.. Over the next few months we tried relentlessly tracking her ovulation and taking temps and had no luck.. We decided to take a break for awhile and lo and behold while on vacation she got pregnant.. This time the pregnancy stuck (but not without some complications) and we welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world.. Fast forward a year later and we began trying for another baby.. Subsequently over the next two and a half years my wife has gotten pregnant (confirmed again with multiple pregnancy tests over multiple days) 4 more times.. Devastatingly each one of those pregnancies has ended with an miscarriage, including one tonight.. I don\u2019t claim to know much about this matter but I can tell you that my wife does.. she has done her homework and does everything possible to take care of herself and increase the odds keeping a healthy baby.. I am devastated but am trying to be strong for her while holding back my own tears.. Something does not seem right, but I don\u2019t know what it is.. We have talked in the past about seeing a specialist but for one reason or another never did.. I know we will have that conversation again after these wounds begin to heal but I can\u2019t wrap my head around why this may be happening.. I am turning to the lovely people of Reddit for some help, guidance, knowledge.. Has anyone experienced this before? What could be going wrong?

We got married April of 2018 and we are happily married. This is just getting this off my chest and maybe help someone else who is just starting there journey. I've never had regular period in my life ever. My natural periods are heavy and painful (a 9/10 or higher). Its a nightmare and they can last up to 7 or 8 days. This happened inconsistently when I was young. i started at almost 13years old. When I was 17 I brought up to my mom I was never consistent and on my yearly check up with my pediatrician they had me get test. I had blood work and an ultrasound done. From what I remember I had elevated testerone (only thing mentioned) but no cyst or  anything on my ultrasound. Everything looked good. My pediatrician had suspected pcos but basically she said I should get on Birth control. My shit storm of a father refused and said it would encourage me to have sex blah blah blah. it was stupid and I tried to convince him I'm not only i need this per doctors recommendation. Nope nothing. I've always wanted a family and I knew my period issues would cause a problem. it was apparent to me and this made it worse as it was the only thing I initially knew would help. \n\n\nFast forward a year and me and hubby had started dating. At 1st we used condoms and I did get my period the 1st 3 months we were together. we stopped a few months into it. I went to see a doctor same pediatrician and started Birth control (Sprintec?). Took 3 months for a painful period to Kick in but August of 2017 I started taking it monthly.  We were even younger than we are now and at the times we werent ready for kids. We get engaged Oct 2017 and married April 2018.  This whole time we talk of kids and a family but that stuff didn't get real until after we were married. My hubby noticed I watched a lot of videos about pregnancy and announcements and just the whole process and he asked me in June 2018 how serious I was about kids. I explained how I wanted them and I've always wanted a big family (possible 5 kids). He sees the spark in my eyes I guess and he agrees we can start trying. so July of that year I had my final period on birth control and quit a terrible stressful job at the same time. I do some basic research. Buy a digital ovulation kit (clearblue) and we have set everywhere day for a month. I was aware it could take awhile for period to come back so 1st month off no period. 2nd month off nothing. Both months negative test. I go back to work August of 2018. no positive ovulation or pregnancy test. I cried a lot. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. Something is wrong as by Oct i still don't have a period. \n\n\nI see an obgyn. tell her whats up. Now since I've been with hubby I've gained a lot of weight. I went from 120 ish to by this time 185-190 lbs in a year and a half. rapid. And especially since I stopped working mt old fast food job wasn't on my feet 6 to 10 hours a day so I wasn't active. stayed at about 150lbs-160lbs working at my fast food place (I had been working there for a year and a half. I ate there but not much. was picky about food but stress and long hours standing, walking, running and moving kept me low). She informs me that I need to lose weight, stop eating a lot of sugar and soda and go back on birth control for at least like 6 months. I was very upset by this I cried. I didn't want to take birth control. Although she was right about my weight I didn't think it would solve my proves. she suggested I had pcos but never confimed and mostly said kept insulin in check by eating better and the weight will fall off. I hated her as she never addressed my long term struggle with peeiod which were like that for years when I was skinny (ive been very skinny as a child always). She did induce my peeiod with progestrone (prometirum I think was the name brand) and I had a heavy period. I got blood test but nothing stood out. I had the test dont before my period I didn't know it made a different at the time. \n\nAnyways I cut back eating sugars some mostly with candy ans I tried to cut out soda/juice but soon my husband lost his job in Nov 2018 and we fell on hard times for a few months. and we leave our 1st married apartment ( got in April 2018). we had a week where we stayed at family as it wasn't a smooth house transition. At that time I found an RE (if you don't know reproductive endocrinologist). I found out what they were and what they do and how they would be able to directly help me. I excitedly told my husband and we made plans to go see one and I saved up money along with an HSA card. \n\nApril 2019 I seen the RE who we will call Dr. C. An amazing doctor. Again I got blood work. I had very low vitamin D my testerone was not a problem that was noted. I think I had some slightly elevated estrogen. He went over my systems and I at this point had an idea of what was going on, PCOS, and knew some of what I needed. i hadn't had a peeiod since my induced one back in Oct/Nov 2018. it had been a few months Dr. C noticed my larger weight gain which I was over 210lbs by the time I had seen him. He noted all my problem and gave me an ultrasound. He stated I did have pcos. Hubby evebt for test with his perm and everythinf came back almost period (he was a bit on the thick side but lots of swimmers) He recommended I did lose the weight. Gave me a prescription for vitamin D 50,000iui as mines was so incredibly low it was crazy. I took that for 8 weeks and then too regular supplements. I started prenatal and he got me on progeatrone (I told him I didn't want BC and he totally understood so this was my next option 1 pill for 10 days on the 1st 10 days of the month. 1 month took it nothing happened. Dr. C did inform me I may or may not get one and I could get pregnant. He also offered to start treatment of letrozole whenever I was ready although he did recommend losing weight to lower my risk I was still able to get treatment. \n\nThat month (June 2019) other family stuff came up so we couldn't start to my disappointment. But July 2018 I got my first period in over 200 days. it was short and spotty but something. August 2018 I joined group on Facebook and started with cheaper ovulation test and started bbt. Nothing happened and treatment was expensive so I ended up not getting treatment and tried to lose weight. I was on Ovasitol from June till Oct 2019 but that wasn't working and was expensive. I asked for metformin which is the medicine for pcos and diabetes. Welp that helped much more.\n\n Dec 2019-Mar 2020 I went from recorded weight previously 215 till 204 and stayed there till recently (I'm back at about 208 due to covid-19. stress, stress eating and food shortages of my normal stuff). Well good news I finally had the money for my 1st treatment. timed Intercourse with letrozole. I started my pweiod Feb 14. started treatment 2 days after. it almost was perfect but we were short money. I needed a 3rd monitoring ultrasound. I couldn't take the specific triggering shot which would for sure induce my eggs to release. I was on 2.5 mg of letrozole and I got 2 eggs that began to mature on one side only. \n\nI ended up not pregnant even with some signs like sex feeling different which was a 1st for me. that crushed me and hubby and the cost being 340 per office visit with ultrasound was a lot. so we ended up taking a break. mostly for him and our finances. he was emotionally drained and needed a break and I was crushed that the money we needed wouldn't be here till next year. I felt betrayed and like nothing I did mattered. I tried so hard and just nothing was enough. Betrayed by God and everything. \n\nThen covid 19 happened and tax returns came back and now we have saved half our return in order to go get treatments for another cycle. after I meet my deductible this next cycle out of pocket cost will be 15%. if it doesn't work we can try another round of letrozole or even do iui. Even with covid 19 we plan on trying in May again as my trigger shot is only good for 6 months (still in my fridge) which would be July of this year. This is like the best I can say for me.\n\n I'm excited to try again. I really want to be a mom and I want to be pregnant. I'm hoping for the best. If anyone wants more details about how my timed intercourse went or my weight struggles or what pcos is like or what medicines I have and haven't taken you can ask away. idk if anyone will read this but if so good luck and try not to give up.

In fact the doctors gave me an adjusted window of time. From that day,when I was 19, until about 25. They told me things like, \u201cnot impossible\u201d, \u201cabout 30% chance\u201d \u201cthere are treatments your insurance will cover\u201d and my favorite, \u201cyou are young, you have options.\u201d \n\nIt hurt me a lot to know that I would probably never carry a child. Ever since I was carrying a baby doll, I had a lot of dreams but they always involved me becoming a mother. Being a better parent than mine were, showing my children a better childhood than I had. \n\nMy mother left when I was young, I used to hate her for it but I don\u2019t really anymore, I understand now that sometimes people just aren\u2019t together for the right reasons. The only thing I resent is that I was forced to raise my older sister and younger brother when my father was working his ass off, trying to keep a roof over our heads. \n\nSure there were babysitters on occasion, but when dad couldn\u2019t pay them, they left and never came back. Couldn\u2019t blame them though, my older sister was an 10 year old momma\u2019s girl that shut down when our mom left. My brother was 7 and couldn\u2019t understand anything going on around him. And I was an asshole 9 year old who wouldn\u2019t let them change a thing in my house because it was my job to help my daddy. \n\nThere were only a few people who really helped, one of them is a woman I call mom now. Her name is Sarah, she is my best friends mom. She always made sure we had what we needed, groceries, clothes, she even got my hair and nails done several times. Never once asking my dad for money or a thank you, took on the roll of my momma because she knew mine didn\u2019t give a shit. She\u2019d always say, \u201cyour mom loves you.\u201d When I said things like that but I never believed it. \n\nI was a child raising children that weren\u2019t mine, I cooked, cleaned, learned to braid hair, cut boys hair, I learned to sew clothes because we couldn\u2019t afford new ones, first aid, CPR, I was the one calling to make doctors appointments, waking my brother and sister up for school, me GOD DAMN it not them! But they try to take the credit for it, and no one ever gave me a thank you. \n\nInstead they say \u201cI raised you guys right.\u201d Fuck you! You didn\u2019t do shit, it was me! We saw mom on the weekends until we all realized our mother was full of shit. And my dad was so busy working, I couldn\u2019t let him see the stress and pain I was in. So he didn\u2019t go to sporting events for my brother and I as we grew up. Didn\u2019t come to my honors society induction. Couldn\u2019t even stay for my entire graduation. I worked so hard and no one ever said I\u2019m proud of you. Not once. \n\nThe only time my parents were really there for me is when I was rushed to the hospital because my high school sweetheart poisoned me. I was 19 and in college, living at home, he was 18 also in college. We dated for 3 and a half years. He saw all the shit I went through and then when I had a pregnancy test come up positive he panicked. Not in front of me of course, no he was calmed and said we\u2019d work it out. I was 2 months a long when I started to feel sick and bleeding, I thought it was just a miscarriage until I started to get dizzy and collapsed. My brother found me on the kitchen floor and immediately called 911. And rode to the hospital with me; my heart stopped in route. The paramedics brought me back but I don\u2019t remember anything. Not until I woke up. \n\nI was in the ICU and my dad, mom and stepdad were sitting next to me, when I came to. They immediately called the doctor in and they asked me a series of questions. I answered and they told me I\u2019d died. I was still too out of it to fully appreciate the gravity of what they had told me. My ovary had ruptured due to a high concentration of vitamin C, which is used sometimes to self-abort. They asked me if it was possible that someone was dosing me with it.  There was no way I was taking it knowingly, finally it occurred to me that the only thing I\u2019d been taking were the prenatal vitamins I\u2019d asked my boyfriend to pick up for me. My dad went home and grabbed the bottle, when they ran tests they found that what should\u2019ve been the vitamins were actually vitamins C tablets.\n\nWhen he came to visit me at the hospital the police were waiting there for him, the only prints on the bottle were mine and his as my dad was smart enough to use gloves when grabbing it. He was noticeably scared when he entered my room and a cop was there. Luckily my dad wasn\u2019t in the hospital at the time of his arrival. I asked him why he did it, in front of the doctor and police officer. He acted like he didn\u2019t know at first, I couldn\u2019t bring my eyes to meet his. I asked the doctor to explain what happened, he told him that Vitamin C in high amounts can abort a fetus but in my particular case it also caused a cyst on my left ovary to rupture and took my ovary with it. Resulting in not only in a miscarriage but extreme blood loss and internal bleeding. And ultimately my death for a minute and a half and may have ruined my chances of children in the future . He didn\u2019t even try to hide his sobs as the doctor explained. \u201cI did it so that I could maintain my scholarship. If I had children it would go to them and I\u2019d have to pay for school out of pocket.\u201d I still hear those words echo in my head today. He did it for money. As the officer read him, his rights I looked him in the eye and said I forgive you. And he left\n\nMonths later we met in court and when I took the stand I relived the horrible experience. I let out everything I pretty much said above and added but one thing, \u201cI would have done it on my own, I raised two kids when I was growing up, I could\u2019ve raised another. You could\u2019ve walked away but I forgive you not for you, but for me.\u201d I told him that I loved him but what he did ruined my life and that I hope he never has to go through what I did. \n\nHe was given 3 years in jail because I asked the judge to be easy on him. I did this hoping it would bring me good karma.. But nothing.. here I am 24, a teacher, with a man who loves me and wants a baby someday. And we\u2019re doing treatments and trying regularly but to no avail. But I am forced to watch my friends and sisters have children and pretend to be happy because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. My sisters, who\u2019ve always said they never wanted children, who cuss and yell at them, one of them actually told my nephew she hated him. Why do they get to have children and not love them while I\u2019m forced to struggle and am the only one who really wants them?! It isn\u2019t fair, fuck whatever higher power that said it was cool. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair... it\u2019s not fair... and I can\u2019t say anything about it because \u201cit\u2019s a sad topic\u201d so here I am writing to you guys.. what do I do?

I am not trying to engage in a pain olympics.\n\nI am curious what others have found to be their biggest loss in infertility.  Of course there is the devastation of a miscarriage, which I haven't personally experienced.  But sometimes, because I haven't experienced a miscarriage, I think other (fertile) people assume I haven't lost anything or am not grieving anything.  As you all know, that is not true.\n\nEven two years into this, one of the biggest losses for me is the idea that sex = a baby.  I've had a lot of those feelings being triggered this past month when we were forced to try naturally after a FET fail.  I tracked my ovulation and my husband and I had a ton of sex (surprise! It didn't work).  It was weird being back in that stage of thinking \"maybe . . .\" and having sex to try to get pregnant.  I know our only shot in hell is with A LOT of medical intervention.  But it's still hard for me to let go.  Starting at about the age of 30 I have found the idea of procreative sex incredibly hot, and letting go of that has been surprisingly hard for me.  When I talk to people who can conceive on their own, I just think \"you naive little f\\*\\*\\*s don't know how easy you have it.\"  It's like they get to experience the world in the way it is supposed to work, and I/we do not.\n\nAnyone else feel this way, about sex or any other non-tangible loss?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17417, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What's your biggest loss?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g7hhga/whats_your_biggest_loss/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MrsHuff-_-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3a4sx308", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587782272, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/g7ly4a/another_rant_read_if_you_relate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g7ly4a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d01d325e-18e2-11e9-9639-0e9becdb220e", "link_flair_text": "Emotional Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/g7ly4a/another_rant_read_if_you_relate/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1587782276, "score": 1, "selftext": "Alright y\u2019all, I got another one for ya if you\u2019ll listen.\n\nI was at work, everyone at work knows how long I\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant (if you\u2019ve seen my previous posts you\u2019ll know I won\u2019t disclose how long that\u2019s been) \n\nI miscarried last cycle (post found way back).\n\nThis was my first period after a miscarriage.

We\u2019ve got issues on both sides including mild male factor, persistent ovarian cyst (yes, just one), supplemental synthroid due to highish TSH. \nBiggest issue I\u2019m having is with this cyst. It is about 2.5cm on my right ovarian and it\u2019s been there since at least sept 2019- that\u2019s when I had my first transvaginal ultrasound. RE says it could have potentially been there for years, we honestly don\u2019t know. Anyways- we tried waiting it out, then birth control pills, then we proceeded anyways with 3 IUIs (all unsuccessful). \nSo we are at the point to move to IVF, but I\u2019m wondering if the cyst was partially to blame for the failures and if surgically removal before ivf would be beneficial. Before the iuis I had a choice to have it surgically removed, but my RE didn\u2019t make it seem necessary, therefore I chose to forego. \nAs I know everyone is kind of at a crossroads due to the Covid and whatnot I just want a solid plan in place before moving forward and my mind has been spinning with all this extra time. \nAnyone have any experiences, comments, opinions, advice about any of this???

She was pregnant 2 cycles later. \n\nMy ob diagnosed me with PCOS before I ever went to the clinic, just from asking me questions and having often very late cycles. He gave me Femera for 3 cycles which did nothing and then recommended me to a specialist clinic. \n\nMy specialist kinda dismissed me having PCOS at all, and I have no idea why. I was never given medication and never monitored. I did get checked if my tubes were blocked and they were not. \n\nHe kinda just wanted us to keep trying naturally while trying every day/every other day during our fertile week. Obviously nothing happened and then my husband got a sperm test.\n\nIt came back not bad but not great. He always said it was on the cusp of if it was worth trying IUI. He had him take 2 more tests. All about the same but he advised not to try IUI unless he got his sperm results better. \n\n**also, this was MONTHS in between all of this. If he did a sample, the clinic NEVER called to give results. It always took several weeks, after a while we could call and they would say they have it but we need to do another consultation or get another test or whatever. They never reached out to us for next steps, it was always waiting for several weeks then demanding more help. \n\nHe then basically told my husband to go to a urologist (part of this same clinic) to maybe find a problem and get it fixed enough to try IUI. If not, he has been pushing for IVF this whole time which we don\u2019t want to do. \n\nI just feel like they have not been giving us much concern and it\u2019s been WAY too long of a process for no answers and a very frustrating course of what to do next. The urologist wants MORE sperm samples and a lot more like ultrasounds etc which with their timeline will take several months before we even get answers and a plan of action. \n\nWe are going on 3 years suffering through infertility.

Specific details (singleton vs twins, HR, size, etc) may be shared at a pregnancy sub such as /r/infertilitybabies. If an ultrasound provides questionable results, such as a large yolk sac or low heart rate, those details can be shared here.\n\n* Any concerns about an unconfirmed or potential chemical pregnancy, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. can only be discussed in this thread. If a physician has officially deemed a pregnancy a loss, posts can be made anywhere on the sub with a TW: on-going loss.\n\nPosts that are not appropriate for this thread:\n\n* Hunger games results, PGS results, etc.\n\n* Questions about early pregnancy that are not related to loss. Comments about pregnancy symptoms (sore breasts, nausea, etc).\n\n* Links to pictures of HPTs (use /r/TFABlineporn).\n\n* Pregnancy updates past 7 weeks that are meeting normal metrics. *Those who find themselves in pregnancy limbo may continue to post in this thread.*\n\n* Responding \u201cThank You!\u201d to every well wisher. Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response, however responding to every person makes this post far too large.\n\n*Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need.* This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result.

I realized after posting that this is the point where I should introduce myself here and illicit the wealth of experience and knowledge on this sub.\n\nSpeaking of which and before I get into my own sad sorry story, this sub is everything!! I'm fairly new here but unfortunately not in the least new to the topic and I've been going insane over the past three years since I've been in active treatment toggling between various b&amp;by d&amp;st nightmare-boards, desperately wishing for a place on the internet exactly like this one. Thank you so much for making it exist &lt;3. \n\nSo now me. Trying for 3.5 years, in treatment for almost 3. We were considered solely MFI (husband has good count but moderate-low motility and low morphology fluctuating from 1-3 percent normal, probably due to his epilepsy medication) But after two failed IUIs and three IVF cycles resulting in no live births as well as me aging up from 34 to 37, the assumption is that my egg quality is likely compromised and so we seem to have gone from MFI to \"multiple factors.\" \n\nAfter the two failed IUIs, we did a short-protocol antagonist cycle, yielding only one blast that did implant but then turned out to be a chemical. Because I got pregnant, we repeated the protocol but saw uneven development and a lead follicle, leading to only two fair-quality day-3 embryos, neither of which took. We tried one last short protocol but canceled the cycle because of uneven development and then switched to a long-protocol agonist cycle (in between I had a hysteroscopy to remove a cyst) which resulted in a significantly higher egg count and a good amount of embryos but nothing stuck (still have one frozen day-6 blast from that). \n\nAfter that I did the EndomeTrio from Igenomix, which not only tests receptivity but also bacterial culture and some measure of toxicity in the uterus. I was receptive but found to have \"ultralow biomass,\" ie not enough lactobacilii in my uterus, which I treated with Gynoflor suppositories (science is a bit fuzzy as to whether it has any effect but go off Igenomix).\n\nOh we've done the genetic panels and have no issues there, but I have Factor V Leiden, psoriatic arthritis and the MTHFR mutation, so I do blood thinner and prednisone from transfer and take Methylfolate (as well as CoQ10, DHEA and basically every other recommended supplement from It Starts With The Egg, okayed by my RE). I also take a thyroid pill. Oh, and I actually got pregnant accidentally twice when I was much younger and totally unready for motherhood. I miscarried both before I was able to abort, which points further to egg quality issues.\n\nSo now I'm starting down-reg on Wednesday with Synarel (I'm in Germany and they prefer that to Lupron here generally) for my fourth cycle. On my Thursday ultrasound my RE thinks she saw around 12 antral follicles, which is fine but lower than what I've had before. My AMH has also dipped in the past year from 2.05 to 1.25. Once my cycle starts I'll begin with daily injections of Pergoveris (150 iu FSH, 75 iu LH), then eventually trigger with Ovidrell for a retrieval around May 20 (my 38th birthday). \n\nThe lovely twist is that in Germany all pre-implantation genetic analysis is banned, largely due to holdover anxiety about the Nazi eugenics programs. There are other weird rules, like you can only culture 5 embryos at a time, so if you get more than that you have to freeze them on day one (half of my fertilized long-protocol eggs were frozen as zygotes, then thawed and cultured). Anyway, that means I have no idea about aneuploidy or whether we have even made any chromosomally normal embryos. \n\nThe good part about living here though is that almost everything so far has been covered by insurance, but that runs out after this last round, plus I honestly feel like I can't go on with this if this round fails. But NO PRESSURE, right? lol fml. \n\nAnyway, I guess in the spirit of leaving no stone unturned, I just wanted to put this all up here in case any of you might have insights due to overlapping experiences or see anything I've missed or maybe just to say hi.

First SA in April 2019 showed 10 immobile sperm. He started on Gonasi to try and replace his synthetic testosterone on April 19 and his results were really phenomenal and his natural testoterone kicked in so well she had to reduce his dosage which was brilliant and we tried for SA again in Feb and it was 0.\n\nNever mind I thought. the doctor was clear that might happen as he's still not producing LH and FSH so prescribed that. We picked up his first load yesterday but not planning to start it for a month as 1. very expensive and don't really want to risk earlier pregnancy (I'll explain that later) but 2. if he has a reaction getting medical support will be difficult.\n\nWe had originally started thinking about trying for a baby in late 20/early 21 but we just don't know if the drugs are gonna work. We want to start them earlier to see if they work but also don't want to risk getting pregnant til he has passed his probation at his new job in September.\n\nI currently have a coil due to having horrific periods but it expires in August so were thinking about having it out then and letting my hormones settle for a few cycles before this new hormone works.\n\nI have always been positive about this process, guess partly cos i've never been the \"baby fever\" type and the idea of having kids was always so abstract.\n\nBut suddenly in lock down all my priorities are changing and starting to think about this and really deal with how hard this will all be. My family are the type that all got pregnant like that and even until recently i just held out hope the drugs will work and we will be able to conceive a child naturally and now realising this may not be as easy as i always dreamed and I am struggling to let go of the dream that I may not be able to conceive in a romantic way.\n\nSo instead I am becoming obsessive about looking at hospitals to give birth in or ivf clinics to use or donor and adoption websites just for some level of control. \n\nIt's suddenly all hitting me and i can't talk to anyone as everyone else in my family just thought about it and they were pregnant.

I was diagnosed with PCOS August 2016. My biggest struggle has been just getting to ovulation. Weight/acne/abnormal hair growth is thankfully not too much of an issue. \nWe did 2 monitored cycles with Femara/ovidrel and timed intercourse. 2nd cycle we conceived but sadly ended in chemical pregnancy, lost before 6 weeks. After that I had a surgery to remove an arcuate in my uterus (heart shaped with a septum). We went on about 3-4 more similar cycles and added Gonal-F. My last cycle I had potentially 3-6 mature follicles. Still did not conceive. \nWe took a good long break from seeing the specialists. Our feelings were that they really didn\u2019t care enough since we were so young. I don\u2019t see IVF being in our future. \nWe tried clomid through my OB, didn\u2019t help. \nFor the last year I have been working with a NaPro Women\u2019s Health and Fertility doctor. I absolutely love her and finally feel like I am getting the help that I need. We are currently on cycle 2 with Femara again and just hoping for good results. Husband has had 2 tests done and both were normal. I had an hsg done 2 months ago, and tubes were clear.\nMy whole point is... I do get discouraged when I see success stories after infertility. But 95% of what I see is all after IVF. Can anyone else relate to this?

I started with donating my eggs in my early twenties, then I met the love of my life through it, and now that I\u2019m ready, we haven\u2019t been able to conceive naturally.\n\n\u2014\n\nI am about to take y\u2019all on a wild journey. I\u2019m not upset, just finally accepting the universe and the way that things play out. There\u2019s three \u201cparts\u201d to my story:\n\nFirst part: \n\nI donated my eggs to four different families in the last several years. I typically produced 15-20 mature/viable eggs for the IP\u2019s to use. All the families opted for anonymous donations, so I never got updates if they turned out successfully. I am under the impression that at least one resulted in a successful pregnancy, as my agency made a slip in conversation that I am \u201ca more attractive candidate because my eggs have resulted in pregnancy\u201d. She didn\u2019t let me know if the baby made it full-term, if it was a boy/girl, or anything else.\n\nFor the last several years, I have hoped that all the pain and misery that both the Intended Mothers and myself went through to get those eggs, resulted in a successful pregnancy for them.\n\nIf any of you have used donor eggs, I beg you to allow the agency to inform the donor if it was successful. Donors don\u2019t need your names, location, identifying details, whatever... just that what we went through wasn\u2019t for nothing. I am sure that some weren\u2019t successful, so I would rather grieve simultaneously with you than to never know... but if they were... I would be elated for you, and I would always here if you or the child ever needed anything. (Contrary to popular belief, there are donors that do it completely for philanthropic reasons... and if you ever needed help financially or otherwise, I would be here to assist.)\n\nIt would also be helpful to emotionally prepare a donor  IF your child ever decided to reach out. There are a lot of reasons why someone may want to reach out to a genetic parent: curiosity, genetic diseases/traits they need more information on, if you/you\u2019re partner pass away and they need support, child/parent resentment, familial issues, etc... if your donor has this information beforehand, we can come together to make a plan to best protect and help the child WE ALL MADE together.\n\n\u2014\n\nSecond part: \n\nMy last donation was in 2018. It was an international cycle and they flew me to Mexico City to donate. It ended up with me in the hospital with OHSS. One of the most painful and terrifying experiences of my life. I had flown back to Canada (thankfully!), and the doctors didn\u2019t know if I was bleeding internally from the operation OR if I had OHSS. Part of the treatment for OHSS is to give blood-thinners, which obviously they could not give to me if I was bleeding internally. All-in-all, it scared me off of donating my eggs. \n\nI called my agency to take down my profile while I was still in the hospital. I was done. I\u2019d done my part. \n\nMy representative at the agency totally understood and said she would take it down when she got to the office the next day.\n\nWell it turns out there was a man on the other side of the country looking at my profile the same night that I had I requested to pull my profile. He sent a request that was emotionally charged and a financial offer that was... *obscene*. He said he had been searching for a donor for months and I was the first one that had been what he was looking for. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning to his letter and offer, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I told him I needed time to physically recover, but that I was most likely not going to do it because of my near-death experience.\n\nMy agency took down my profile and as the months went by, he kept asking my agency if I would consider.\n\nWe exchanged multiple anonymous emails to each other during this time and after about three months of this, we did a group call with the agency... and this call felt like the universe was urging me to do *one more donation*.\n\nI\u2019m not a spiritual person. I am science-based. Logic. Reason. WHY I felt this way, I don\u2019t know... but I agreed to do one more donation for him on our skype call. My representative from the agency said she would organize the doctor and flights and get back to us.\n\nThen... \n\nNothing.\n\nI agreed to do another fucking donation against my sound logic of stopping!!!\n\nAfter MONTHS of him reaching out... nothing. The agency completely stopped all communication after our skype call.\n\nThe date we had agreed upon for our meeting and doctor visits had passed. \n\nAnd then I get a notification on my phone that someone had commented on my Instagram... IT WAS HIM! He found the real me!\n\nHis message said, \u201cHey it\u2019s XXXXX. Here\u2019s my number XXX-XXX-XXXX.\u201d\n\nI quickly texted him and asked him WTF is going on. He asked the same. We exchanged back-and-forth, \u201cwe said XX date, why didn\u2019t I get the flight &amp; doctor confirmations?\u201d\n\nTurns out, the agency had completely ghosted both of us. \n\nWe found each other outside of the agency and decided to proceed as planned. I flew out to his city to get started with the cycle. It immediately blossomed into a genuine relationship. \n\nWe proposed an unorthodox relationship to each other... our main focus being raising healthy children. It was a whirlwind romance... and within FOUR MONTHS we were married.\n\nI\u2019m fairly certain we are the only people in the world who have met through anonymous egg donation?\n\n\u2014\n\nThird part:\n\nIt\u2019s now been almost two years. It\u2019s the best relationship we\u2019ve both ever had. We tried to conceive naturally for the first year with no success. \n\nConsidering I\u2019m an egg donor, I figured this would be a cake-walk.\n\nBut, no.\n\nI am an expert on my cycle, ovulation, we\u2019ve had a couple \u201cOMG I THINK IM PREGNANT\u201d false pregnancies, and we\u2019ve had one confirmed miscarriage... \n\nAnd now I get to experience the \u201cother\u201d side of IVF. I am now taking a full cycle of meds of what I would normally do to donate my eggs, but now for my own pregnancy. \n\nI was supposed to start March 14, 2020. The medication is in my fridge. But our doctors advised us to wait as it was a very uncertain time, and we didn\u2019t know if I would be able to have the \u201cretrieval\u201d as scheduled with the pandemic.\n\nI thought this was finally my chance at experiencing what I was (hopefully) giving others... and with COVID-19, I\u2019ve had to put this on hold. \n\n\u2014\n\nI know there are so many of you within this forum who\u2019ve tried for years... and I\u2019ve heard all the same shit, \u201cjust relax\u201d, \u201cit will come\u201d, \u201cjust adopt\u201d, \u201chave you tried this bullshit tea?\u201d, or \u201ctry hanging upside down after\u201d, or \u201cyou\u2019re still young enough, don\u2019t worry\u201d.\n\nHoly fuck.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been on a rollercoaster with this. I worry I\u2019ve damaged myself with all the donations and now I can\u2019t have my own. I worry about the potential children that are out there. I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get to experience pregnancy for myself.\n\nCOVID-19 has thrown us another curveball in our infertility journey, but somehow I feel that maybe I was always supposed to just be an egg donor and never a mother myself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 17437, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I donated my eggs.

We are the fatherhood company, helping men and transgender women on their journey to fatherhood. \n\nMale fertility is often overlooked and destigmatized, even though male-factor infertility is responsible for 30-50% of infertility cases in couples. We're working on changing the view that fertility is a \"women's issue\". \n\nMale fertility has declined by 50% in the last 40 years, and infertility affects about 1 in 7 couples. So thinking about male fertility matters for single men, men in heterosexual couples men in same-sex relationships, trans-gender women, cancer patients, men in the military, men in high-risk occupations, and more. \n\nWe started out of Harvard's Innovation Labs in early 2018, and have grown significantly since then. We offer from-home sperm testing and sperm cryopreservation via mail-in kits, which is important for cost and accessibility (since not everyone can, or wants to, go visit a local clinic).\n\nWe will be **answering questions throughout today and tomorrow**.

The doctors these last 2 years say I\u2019m fine and have a good follicle but nothings happening. \n\nLong story:\nAt 18, i started birth control which threw my periods out of wack.

They told me I was infertile. \n\n20, I stopped the birth control but my periods were still heavy and irregular for awhile. \n\nAt 23, the doctors withdrew their diagnoses and said the only thing I have is fibroids and ovarian cysts. I got pregnant after the first time trying, but then I miscarried after 2 months (due to severe stress I think?). I stopped having sex. \n\nAt 24, I started trying again. I\u2019m 25 and nothing has happened which I just find odd because it seemed to happen so quickly the first time around a few years ago and I\u2019m only healthier (seemingly) now. The doctors tested my hormones including thyroid and they\u2019re all in range. The only thing I can think of is maybe I\u2019m stressed about having a kid right now whereas before I wasn\u2019t really trying hard?

I\u2019ve never posted here before, but I can assure you that I have been here a while and this group has seen me through some dark days and made me feel so much less alone. This is my first time posting here so if this is not the right place, I apologize. I tried searching other posts, but couldn\u2019t find anything similar to what I am encountering.\n\nI have UHC as my insurance with a $25k lifetime maximum (located in NJ). Thus far, I have had 3 egg retrievals and 1 failed FET. UHC is insisting that I have roughly $19k remaining before I hit my maximum. Both my clinic and I find this hard to believe, but I\u2019m not sure what else to do if they\u2019re telling me incorrect information multiple times (and in writing).\n\nI\u2019m at the point where I need to go for another retrieval. My clinic is basically presenting this like I will be paying out of pocket. Their perspective is that UHC will eventually realize they\u2019ve overpaid and I will be responsible for payment and they basically don\u2019t want to deal with not getting paid while I potentially battle UHC. My financial coordinator also told me that the insurance providers can pay claims and then years (up to 3) later realize they overpaid and then patients are responsible. \n\nHas anyone ever encountered this and gone down the road of \u201cbelieving\u201d the insurance\u2019s likely wrong information? Has it come back to haunt you and did you win the fight against them? I don\u2019t want to set myself or the clinic up for an insurance battle, but I also don\u2019t want to miss out on benefits I pay for.

I've been lurking here a little while now, and as I'm heading toward IVF in the next couple cycles I wanted to introduce myself and connect with people over the mental/emotional side of all this.\n\nI've been trying since 1/19. I had a lap/hysteroscopy a few months ago that removed Stage I endo and corrected an arcuate uterus, but I regret this as two other REs I've talked to don't think surgery is worthwhile for these things. No other known issues except a longish cycle. However, I'm not surprised at all to be in this position. I remember naively reading \"What to Expect When You're Trying to Conceive\" right when we started and hearing for the first time to budget a year and that some women still didn't conceive by then, often for no clear reason, and this was called infertility. I still remember feeling sick and saying to my husband, \"I just know this is going to be me.\"\n\nI had actually started going to therapy several months before we started trying to help me cope with my disappointment in my stalled career (which I decided to stay in bc I expected to be pregnant shortly; I'll need to start in a whole new field, and I wanted to take time off when my kid(s) are little) and my lifelong feeling that I was powerless and my efforts weren't rewarded with the expected outcomes. Unfortunately, after over a year with that therapist and 3+ months with a new one, my experiences of therapy and infertility have only confirmed this feeling. The kicker is I can't help believing that my mental health is making getting pregnant harder. Ahhh!\n\nI just feel like everything I hear about therapy, from friends, to Reddit posts, to health sites, makes it sound like people walk away from most sessions feeling better, with a new perspective or better coping skills, but even though I've worked hard and connected with both of my therapists, nothing is changing. So I would love to hear from anyone who has had success in therapy around fertility what they learned, what those coping skills are, how to make yourself more open to change, how to let go of resentment of friends who got pregnant easily, or anything else useful that you got from the experience.
