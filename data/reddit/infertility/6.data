We still really like her a lot personally--I'd have a beer with her--but I feel like we're at a decision point with her and the clinic (she's the only doctor).\n\n\n\nRelevant lab info:\n\n**Her**: Recent CD3 (after Provera) 5.9 FSH, 5.9 LH, 30 Estradiol.  Mid cycle tests AMH 10.6, total Testosterone 100ng/dL, free Testosterone 7.2pg/mL.  Elevated cholesterol, BMI 22.9.  All other typical labs normal.\n\n**Him**: 1st SA very low count, 2.2MM total--volume 3.1,  57% motility, 14% morphology (WHO criteria). 2nd SA \"too few to count\" per lab.  Pending SA and hormone labs with urologist.\n\n\n\n\nShe recommended waiting to hear what the urologist says, which will take several weeks since the urologist wants SquirrelBoy to freeze sperm with the RE's clinic prior to providing him a sample for SA, but my RE can't get him in to freeze until May 18th.  This is annoying because it's their scheduling issues that it causing our delays, but I get it--half of the pain of IF is the endless waiting.\n\nI agree with the RE that if the urologist can't find a way to increase Boy's counts, then we'll go straight to IVF. \n\nWhat I'd like to get is your opinion on some of the things she said, which are making me consider getting a second opinion and working with a different clinic.\n\n* She said that women with \"thin PCOS\" are hard to stim and have a narrow window of stimming correctly--not under- or over-stimming.  In your experience, true or not true?\n* The clinic is small and they do fewer cycles per year vs. other clinics in my area.  I directly asked her about her lower-than-region average live birth rate (thank you sart.org!), but she explained that her clinic takes on more complicated cases which hold down her numbers.  I appreciated her honesty, but is this a bad sign?\n* Because the clinic is small, they only do IVF about 12 times a year and they batch patients together.  I get that they do this as a cost effective measure.  The earliest cycle I could even get into is August--three months from now.  Is having to wait to start a cycle to their timing, not mine, normal?\n* She does progesterone support until 11wks for all of her patients.  Necessary, or overkill?\n\nI know that I don't need a second opinion--low sperm count is low sperm count--making IVF the only way we should go.  If you've been in my shoes, do you wish you would have talked to another RE clinic prior to starting with the first RE you met with?\n\nAlso, I got their IVF price for people paying in cash--it's lower than the national average.

My thyroid was slightly high (2.9, they like 2.5 or less), so they started me on a pill for that, but I'm not sure that would be the cause of our infertility. \n\nThey actually didn't even request to check my progesterone, I had to ask them a couple times and then they requested my old results and said that was good enough. From what I've read, sometimes one test result is not clear enough.\n\nI'm meeting with my RE next friday for a reconsult. Could my issues just be pretty much from progesterone? I have read about symptoms of low progesterone and nothing really stands out for me. \n\nCould there be something else? Are there any other tests I should look into?

I like to think that today I made a tiny difference in the world of my friends to help destigmatize infertility.  If nothing else, now I have their kind words to go back and read when I'm feeling low.\n\nHere's what I posted.  Feel free to borrow it.\n\n***********************\n\nHere are some things [SquirrelBoy] and I both can\u2019t do:\n\n* Gracefully tear bread off of a semi-cut loaf at a restaurant\n\n* Stay uncompetitive while playing any type of game\n\n* Have kids the old fashioned way, like most of you can/did\n\n\nWe are working with great doctors and have had nothing but bad news. We have thoughtfully considered all family-building options and will likely be starting IVF in the near future. Adoption, while it can be a good fit for others, is not a good fit for us and that\u2019s OK. We\u2019re lucky that [SquirrelBoy] and I are on the same page about what we want and what our limits are.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things [SquirrelBoy] and I both can do:\n\n* Be happy for you and your families, while sometimes feeling sad for ourselves at the same time. Seeing you guys so happy gives us something to hope for; please keep sharing this part of your lives with us.\n\n* Feel hurt when people minimize what we\u2019ve been going through. Treat us like you would treat any friend who has a chronic medical condition, like IBS or epilepsy\u2014you probably wouldn\u2019t tell them that \u201cthis is God\u2019s will\u201d, \u201crelax and take a vacation and you\u2019ll be cured\u201d, or \u201cbe happy about this because you can still\u2026\u201d. Most of the time we just want people to ask how we\u2019re doing, recognize that this sucks, and be here for us if we need it. Please don\u2019t be offended or pry if we say that we don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\n* Help others feel less alone. Infertility affects an estimated one in eight\u2014statistically, you know lots of other people who struggle with this too, but no one talks about it. I know I struggled to write this. If you\u2019re also part of the one in eight, know that we\u2019re giving you a fist pump in the air in support.\n\nSo please keep us in your thoughts while we go through this crappy time in our lives.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "We outed ourselves on FB today...and received very supportive responses!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/358atp/we_outed_ourselves_on_fb_todayand_received_very/"}, {"author": "classicshell", "author_created_utc": 1325623680, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#1 for 5 years | Endo,  PCOS | 5 IUIs | Saving for IVF", "author_fullname": "t2_6kpvn", "created_utc": 1431054618, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3592rn/can_i_brag_for_a_minute/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3592rn", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 33, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3592rn/can_i_brag_for_a_minute/", "retrieved_on": 1440748337, "score": 43, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "As I'm sure most of you know (for the ones who might not!), my husband and I run a youth organization for young men (12-21). \n\nIn this group of teenage boys, we have this one autistic kiddo.

Just after some advice/opinions and a vent.\n\nSo basically my story is;\n\nFirstly I've been under some extreme stress at work the past 2 years. Out of the ordinary heavy stress. In that time I've developed a host of health issues including psoriasis, hashimotos, and seem to get sick every two months.\n\nI'm 30 years old, reasonably healthy otherwise.\n\nSo Jan 2014 wife and I decide to start trying. October rolls round and we see a specialist as we've had no success and lo and behold my first SA was zero.\n\nTesting is done; hormones, testosterone etc all normal. Genetic/chromosome tests all normal. Ultrasound of testes for visible obstruction. Nil found.\n\nWe schedule a second SA including a urine test (in case of retrograde) and by some miracle sperm is found in the ejaculate (nil in the urine).\n\nSo we go into first IVF cycle with ICSI as the end goal. \n\nA few days in we decide to freeze a sperm sample as back up. I give a sample. Nil sperm.\n\nSo now we plan on doing a TESA the day of wife's retrieval. However an hour prior to the TESA I was to give a sample on case it was good enough.\n\nDay comes and again sample given. Boom! Sperm in sample. No surgery needed. We start with five eggs, two survive to day five. \n\nBoth implanted but nil success.\n\nSecond IVF cycle started with increased dose for wife. Two days ago we go in for retrieval and I am to give a sample followed by TESA if required.\n\nThis time sample has nil. I do the TESA and nil sperm found.\n\nOn the plus wife got 12 eggs, all frozen currently.\n\nSo I'm really frustrated and confused. I would gove anything for just 12 sperm to come back.\n\nHas anyone heard of this sporadic azoospermia???

I am not usually much of a \"sharer,\" but I just need some kind words from people who get it. My husband and I have been trying for our first child since July 2012. After a bunch of tests, we found that we have MFI (0% normal morphology), and so skipped straight to IVF. I've had three egg retrievals. Between the first two, there were 20 eggs retrieved, but only 1 fertilized. \n\nAt that point, we were advised to try a donor to see if the problem was with my eggs or my husband's sperm, so we did a split cycle - 20 more eggs retrieved in one go. Half were combined with my husband's sperm, and half with a donor's. The half with my husband resulted in 0 fertilization, and the half with the donor resulted in all 10 being fertilized; 6 made it to Day 5. Freeze all, and since we've done 2 FET cycles - the first resulted in a chemical pregnancy, and the second ended in miscarriage just last week. \n\nAlong the way, there have been countless tests, ultrasounds, blood draws. Any fear I used to have of doctors is completely gone, replaced by total apathy when I have to see one--except for when we go to the fertility clinic, at which point I just feel angry.\n\nWe have 3 more frozen embryos, but I feel so discouraged with all of it. When we started, my RE was so confident, and so were we, but now, I don't know how much more I can handle.

Just after some advice/opinions and a vent.\n\nSo basically my story is;\n\nFirstly I've been under some extreme stress at work the past 2 years. Out of the ordinary stress. In that time I've developed a host of health issues including psoriasis, hashimotos, and seem to get sick every two months.\n\nI'm 30 years old, reasonably healthy otherwise.\n\nSo Jan 2014 wife and I decide to start trying. October rolls round and we see a specialist as we've had no success and lo and behold my first SA was zero.\n\nTesting is done; hormones, testosterone etc all normal. Genetic/chromosome tests all normal. Ultrasound of testes for visible obstruction. Nil found.\n\nWe schedule a second SA including a urine test (in case of retrograde) and by some miracle sperm is found in the ejaculate (nil in the urine).\n\nSo we go into first IVF cycle woth ICSI as the end goal. \n\nA few days in we decide to freeze a sperm sample as back up. I gove a sample. Nil sperm.\n\nSo now we plan on doing a TESA the day of wife's retrieval. However an hour prior to the TESA I was to give a sample on case it was good enough.\n\nDay comes and again sample given. Boom! Sperm in sample. No surgery needed. We start with five eggs, two survive to day five. \n\nBoth implanted but nil success.\n\nSecond IVF cycle started with increased dose for wife. Two days ago we go in for retrieval and I am to give a sample followed by TESA if required.\n\nThis time sample has nil. I do the TESA and nil sperm found.\n\nOn the plus wife got 12 eggs, all frozen currently.\n\nSo I'm really frustrated and confused. \n\nHas anyone heard of this sporadic azoospermia???

We are thinking of trying IVF. We currently reside in Germany, which has some rather restrictive regulations: if I understand correctly, only three eggs may be fertilized per cycle. I realize that this is to reduce the chances of health hazards related to potential multiple pregnancies, but I also know that this translates to a smaller success rate, and considering that we're not exactly rich, and the treatment is not exactly cheap (insurance covers only half of the expenses unfortunately, and then, only for the first three cycles, after which you're on your own), I'm wondering if it may be best for us to try at a clinic in some other European country with less stringent regulations.\n\nWhat would the more experienced members of this subreddit suggest? Should we try it in a different country? If so, which country would you recommend? I've read some good things about the Czech Republic (and incidentally, Prague seems like a wonderful place for a short vacation), but would definitely consider any country with good health standards and more relaxed IVF laws in Europe.\n\nAs a side note, I should mention that we do not yet know if there is something wrong with our reproductive systems, but we are currently going through tests.\n\nThanks.\n\n\nedit: thank you very much for your valuable input! It sounds like trying IVF in another country may not be such an amazing idea after all.

There is a 25% chance to have a sick baby with each pregnancy. We have the option of PGD+IVF to ensure a healthy baby, or trying naturally and terminating the pregnancy if we find out through cvs testing that baby is sick. We have been tested, no apparent problems but this. We had one natural pregnancy that we terminated at 14 weeks because baby was sick. I had another CP before that and an early miscarriage after. Overall, in the last 10 months I was pregnant 3 times and never made it to the second trimester. We are now considering going the PGD way so we can at least know that our next time we will have a healthy baby to start with.

I have a great friend who I've known since high school (i.e., referred to as my doctor below) who started a wellness practice, and has been wanting to test my hormone/progesterone levels for a long time. Finally, last fall I took the test--it was a salivary test that had 28 specific date/time collections over the course of the month. From the first set of results, you can see how low my progesterone was. \n\nAfter we received the results, my doctor played around with different daily doses: 50mg, 200mg, 150mg, 200mg. We settled on 100mg because that's what seemed to be the best for me.\n\nWe just retested with a shortened version of the test (see the second image) and my levels look just as my doctor expected: elevated for the first half of the month, and leveled out for the second half. This is a good indication that we're on the right track for addressing my progesterone deficiency. We are going to reduce my progesterone to 50mg/day for Days 1-14, and 100mg/day for Days 15-25 of my cycle. \n\nAccording to my doctor, had my progesterone levels been where they should have been, she thinks that I would have gotten pregnant during those two years of IUI. I was ovulating every month, but with the low levels of progesterone, my body was not capable of completing the necessary next steps of keeping/growing a (possibly) fertilized egg.\n\nShe's encouraging me to consider trying again, but emotionally, I just don't know if I want to do it. Those two years were very hard on both me and my husband, and I'm not sure if we can do it again. Right now, I'm just so GD thankful to have my health and well-being back now that my progesterone levels are straightened out. \n\n**I am sharing this with you all because if you're trying to conceive, but haven't had your hormone levels tested, I strongly encourage you to do so.** My tests were much more extensive than are typically found, but with good reason. Most hormone tests are sampled only once, which provides a very limited view. Hormone levels fluctuate daily and monthly, so it's important to capture a holistic view. It was so worth the time, money and effort to see how my hormones level out across the whole month.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any questions or would like any additional information!\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Progesterone test results: from clinically low (Sept 2014) to a change in prescription (May 2015)", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/35erxw/progesterone_test_results_from_clinically_low/"}, {"author": "Silfac", "author_created_utc": 1421591013, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ksdqg", "created_utc": 1431211440, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/35frfj/is_it_just_me/", "gilded": 0, "id": "35frfj", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/35frfj/is_it_just_me/", "retrieved_on": 1440745159, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Is it just me", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/35frfj/is_it_just_me/"}, {"author": "reidiate", "author_created_utc": 1391154218, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "PCOS TTC#1| 5x failed clomid | 1 chem | ", "author_fullname": "t2_f26nk", "created_utc": 1431211592, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/35frpd/question_about_ovulation_induction/", "gilded": 0, "id": "35frpd", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/35frpd/question_about_ovulation_induction/", "retrieved_on": 1440745154, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I started follistim injections last Monday (50iu).

I feel so numb right now I can barely type. This woman - this piece of shit excuse for a human being - has the nerve to make this big to-do about being pregnant for the FOURTH time. She's addicted to drugs (meth, cocaine, pills, whatever she can get her hands on). Every single one of her children have been permanently taken away from her despite every opportunity to get them back. Oh! And her boyfriend (baby daddy) has fucking HIV! That's right! So now, not only does she probably have it, but these babies most likely do as well, including the poor fetus currently residing in this filthy piece of crap.\n\nShe has no job. She has no house. She's literally a prostitute when she runs out of money for food and drugs, at least if she can't manage to steal from my family members. She has been known to sleep with 3 or more people in one day, so she genuinely has no clue who this child's father is. Her oldest is a kleptomaniac that doesn't know right from wrong because, well, look who he's been given to emulate all his life. Her youngest has severe neurological issues on top of autism (no doubt from the massive doses of drugs he got in utero). All she had to do to get her kids back was get a fucking job (any job!) and sign up for government housing that she would almost certainly qualify for. Oh, and have ONE clean piss test. Just one! But she couldn't (or wouldn't) even do that because she doesn't give a single fuck about her kids. *And now she's having another.*\n\nMy mom struggled with whether or not to tell me but decided the safest route would be to pull the bandaid so I wouldn't find out from someone else. I'm glad she did, but it still hurts. I feel like if I were to run into this woman I would slap her face, so it's good I live far away now. I feel like I'm in the audience of a Jerry Springer episode. This is such bullshit. How can someone like this, who freely admits all of these horrible things, be granted the blessing of fertility when I'm sitting here anguishing over a negative OPK? She freely gives her children up to be raised by whoever, and she has no clue how badly I want what she has. What she has thrown away so callously. And what she now has again.

I was going to try one last IVF and then move on with my life, whatever the result?  After 4 years of struggle, I was ready. The universe is mocking me so hard.\n\nIt was definitely disappointing when I didn\u2019t respond to stims back in April, but my RE said we\u2019d wait a few weeks, check things out, and we\u2019d be doing our IVF in late May/early June.  I was okay with this plan.  Retrieval would happen before my 39th birthday in June.  And we\u2019d have our answer and all summer to process the results.  I taught high school for almost 10 years, and for me, the new year still begins in the fall. And come September, we\u2019d move on to whatever life had in store for us.  \n\n\nBut then there\u2019s fucking reality. \n\n\nMy insulin levels tested much too high, even on Metformin. This has become an overall health issue, not just a fertility one. So, losing weight, a low-carb diet, and exercise are huge priorities, and my RE wants at least 3 months and 10% body weight worth of progress before we move on to the next IVF. As I\u2019m sure many of you understand, this is an incredibly emotional and difficult topic for me.  I\u2019ve struggled with my weight for years.  And adding PCOS, migraines, depression, and chronic pain from several physical injuries makes the process that much harder.  I really don\u2019t know if I have the strength to do this right now, but I guess I have to try.\n\n\nAnd since that news and delay wasn\u2019t devastating enough, the 2x2cm paratubal cyst that\u2019s just been hanging out on the edge of my right ovary for 2 years decided that *now* is the time to start rapidly growing and cause concern.  It\u2019s up to 6x7cm. RE put me on BCP in hopes of calming it down, but if there\u2019s growth in the next 4 weeks, it\u2019s time for surgery to remove it.  Another fucking surgery. One that could damage my ovary. I just had polyps removed from my uterus last month. This one would be abdominal but laparoscopic.\n\n\nAnd since the left side of my body couldn\u2019t be left out of all the fun, that tube is now filled with fluid.  RE doesn\u2019t know why.  We\u2019ll deal with that next month when we decide about the cyst.\n\n\nI had a plan.  I wanted to try one last time and then move on.  I was ready for it. But my reproductive system has decided playing infertility whack-a-mole is more fun than letting me find peace of mind.  I was angry and there have been some tears (especially after seeing my nephew this weekend), but I almost feel like I\u2019m still in shock.  Like the reality of the issues and IVF delay isn\u2019t really sinking in.  *Because I don\u2019t know if I can handle it.*\n\nThankfully, some coping mechanisms have kicked in.  I realized I need some creative outlets and projects to put some energy into because my stress levels are insane. So I bought an acoustic guitar.  I don\u2019t even know how to play, but instead of sitting up at night worrying about my life, I\u2019m going to watch some youtube videos and fucking figure it out.  I also got some paint and craft supplies from Michael\u2019s. It\u2019s not quite moving on, and I should be more worried about figuring out my career and an income and other long-term things, but I\u2019m maxed out on stress. I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll ever make it to that final IVF. So fuck it.  Fuck infertility.  I\u2019m in survival mode right now.

This is my third ET and I will find out the beta on Thursday. I have three more embryos but money is running out quickly. There has been this internal chant of \"please, please, please, please.....\" going continually. I turn 31 this weekend. So it is going to be either an awesome or awful birthday. There is just so much riding on this. If it doesn't work I'll have two options. One-take some time off to save up more money. Which I really don't want to do. I just want to be done! One way or the other-done. Every year I tell myself-this will be the year I will find out one way or the other-this is my fourth year of this. And I'll be damned if I'm still riding this fucking roller coaster next year. The other option is to cash out a mutual fund my mom made for me when I was a kid-it is a little over $1,000 but hopefully that would be enough to make one more cycle rather quickly affordable. \n\nI feel so desperate. My husband is done with this. He wasn't completely on board to begin with and every time my heart is broken-either from miscarriage or negative results-he gets more and more against it. He tries to be supportive but just doesn't think the amount of money I'm spending (no, I don't ask him to contribute because he doesn't have the money due to child support) is worth it. \n\nI really wanted to go away this weekend if the results were negative. Just go to another city and drink and party and try to forget about all the lost money and lost hopes. I don't think that is going to happen because we have my stepkids this weekend and I won't find out soon enough for him to be able to change plans.\n\nSo I am keeping everything bottled up. I'm walking on pins and needles inside. Like Mark Zusak said \"Somewhere far down there was an itch in his heart. But he made a point not to scratch it. He was afraid of what might come leaking out.\"  \n\nSo, please please please, send your good thoughts and wishes my way. My heart is so tired.\n\nUpdate: my beta was negative.
