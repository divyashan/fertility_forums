Yes, I'm a shady Grove Fertility patient at the moment.  I'm not displeased with their program or the doctor or any of those things that can cause someone to seek out a new doctor.  Really it comes down to the cost.  And looking at the cost of all the things we pay on top of the program itself, we never thought we'd have to go out more than maybe once or twice really.  \n\nAt the time, SGF was a far better plan than what we had in Orange County SoCal.  We both had jobs... Life was good with the exception of the repeat losses.  \n\nNow we're here, in the greater Seattle area.  My husband is technically on a year long contract with the potential to be either extended or hired full time.  I on the other hand am still...  looking...  working my contacts and networking.  We're okay right now, it's not emergency for me to work immediately.  And I'm doing pet sitting on the side here or there and I'm going to be volunteering at a girl's empowerment camp.  But...  the biggest issue especially for my husband is the lack of security when it comes to getting back in there and having a good ol' FET time.  \n\nSo one thing I think we should do is see what programs are in the area that we can compare - and if we can do local up here it would cut out the cost of flying out to MD and Staying there..  plus it may include the cost of monitoring leading up to the cycle and allow my husband to be here with me rather than having to make the choice to go back to MD alone due to costs.  \n\nSo...  all said...   I know Attain has an IVF refund flex plan thing - I'm considering doing more research into that but I don't know if that is 100%.  We wouldn't need financing because we could cut ties with SGF and receive the money back in full if we choose to.  I am looking for a place that either has their own donor database and using a shared donor program would be great.

The donor mom's RE told me I should move the embryos because she meddles, and the emails from donor mom had so many red flags that indicated a very unhealthy attachment to the embryos. No legal contract was in place yet, and so we walked before we contacted the lawyer, because it was not good.\n\n\nThe very day we chose to unmatch, a different donor reached out to talk. She seemed to have a really healthy outlook on things. A few nights ago, she asked just two additional questions, and one of them was if we would baptize our kids. We're not religious and I'd previously made that clear that despite our upbringings, we didn't come from families of overwhelming faith and decided not to practice religion, so I responded honestly that we would not. I received a kind response back that this match wouldn't work. This was after 2 weeks of messaging back and forth-- literal essays were written, and hours were spent on my side, only to have this not work because of a question that should have been asked upfront.  I sent her a (very polite) message back asking that she please be more upfront with this with future possible recipients. \n\n\nLast Thursday, a potential donor in another group friended me. I accepted because I figured if that was the transparency someone wanted, I'd oblige them. I read her donor profile while she did it and it was clear she wanted a Christian couple. I messaged her and told her honestly that I didn't think we were the right couple for her based on her religious requirements. I received an incredibly rude message back that she agreed, especially after stalking my Facebook page. My Facebook page is literally 90% dogs and 10% election content with a Democratic viewpoint. It was clear we weren't a match, and I was kind and honest, but why did she have to twist the knife?!\n\n\nI am currently on my clinic's wait list and I heard last week that it will be about 1-3 months at this point. If the embryos are less than desirable (very low quantity and/or poor quality), I think I'm going to suck it up and pay for a double donor cycle or do the program of double donor anonymous embryos through California Conceptions.

My husband and I started trying for #1 about a year ago. I had a chemical pregnancy, then got pregnant again and ultimately had a missed miscarriage at 6 / 11 weeks. It was a complicated miscarriage that started with a D&amp;C and ended with 2 emergency D&amp;Cs a week later. I was referred to an RE and have been undergoing all sorts of testing since January. The tissue from the second pregnancy indicated no chromosomal abnormalities, so we don't know what happened. All of our tests since then have come back normal as well. \n\nHowever, since the D&amp;C adventure in December, my periods just haven't been right. They have been getting progressively lighter and shorter, with the most recent one being only around 34 hours long. Clearly that's not normal so my RE had me do the CD3 testing. Much to my surprise, my [Ovarian Assessment Report](http://reprosource.com/clinical-tests/ovarian-assessment-report/) gave me a score of 4, out of 20 (FSH = 10.8, estradiol = 20, LH = 5.8, AMH = 0.68, inhibin B = 67.9). I'm 33 years old. This was back in April, and I was told that since I was mid-cycle we would wait to see if I was pregnant, and if not, we should strongly consider fertility preservation now if we want to maximize the chances that we can have a second child down the road, because my egg quantity and quality will have likely diminished even more by the time we have our first baby and try for a second. \n\nI ended up being pregnant, but something was always a little off from day one. We called it a loss at 7w and I had another D&amp;C. Testing showed tetraplioldy (92 chromosomes instead of 46). Again, a complicated miscarriage ensued. I bled for 3.5 weeks before the RE would finally see me. When she did, she discovered a large blood clot in my uterus that appeared larger than the 6w fetus did. A couple of doses of Misoprostol and an aspiration later, I was still bleeding. She decided to put me on BC pills to sort of \"reset\" my reproductive system. Again, we had a conversation about fertility preservation. Since I keep striking out with pregnancies, and I had to start the pill anyway, all signs seem to be pointing to just going forward with it.\n\nOur plan is to do everything through PGS and freeze all of the embryos that \"pass.\" Given that my OAR score is only 4, it seems the odds of getting more than 4 eggs is low. In the event we get some windfall of good looking embryos, we will implant one, but chances are there won't be many so we will freeze them all in case we have trouble conceiving #2 (an odd thing to say considering we don't yet have #1). I am nervous that we won't get any, though my previous ultrasounds have always shown around 9-10 antral follicles. I hope we can get at least 2-3 good embryos to freeze and use as a backup plan if we have trouble ttc#2.\n\nI'm starting stims in a couple of weeks. The doctor chose the antagonist protocol, so I'll be on 300iu of Gonal F and 150iu of Menopur for +/- 10 days before the HCG trigger. I have so many questions that I didn't get to ask during my consultation (it was cut short due to the fact she also did an aspiration at the same time, so I was a bit woozy from having a golf ball sized clot removed from my uterus): \nI've read that Gonal F shouldn't be used with high FSH, so is my level still within a reasonable range? \nIs the number of antral follicles correlated to how many eggs ultimately get retrieved? \nIs it a problem that I'm going straight into this without having had a real period (aside from withdrawal bleeding from the pill) since my last miscarriage and D&amp;C? \nAre there any dietary changes I should make to improve my chances of getting a lot of eggs/minimizing side effects of the drugs?\nWhat side effects have you ladies had from this cocktail of drugs? \nWhat else did you wish you know before you had started the process? \n\nI will have an opportunity to ask more questions when I go back for my hysteroscopy next week so I want to make sure I don't leave anything out.

I've had this sort of gut feeling that maybe we should switch clinics for IVF #3. I am so glad we went for a second opinion today.\n\nQuick background: did two IVFs due to MFI - first was a 3-day transfer, second was a 5-day transfer. Round 2 worked but had a MC at 12 weeks. Neither round had any embryos make it to freeze, even though we had good fertilization numbers (15 and 10). It was never explained to me why they did a 3-day during round 1, but my own RE had a medical emergency so another guy did it, and I could tell my RE wasn't too happy they did a 3-day.\n\nAnyway, I recently got my first post-D&amp;C period, so it's looking like August will be it for IVF #3. I asked my RE how he planned to proceed and he said another 5-day fresh transfer. While I really like my RE, that made some internal alarm bells ring because nothing about PGS was mentioned, considering I just had a miscarriage and am close to 37. We did do a loss panel - still waiting on our karyotype results for me and hubs, but the antibodies and others all came back ok. They did fetal tissue testing, but the cultures didn't work so we got no answers from that. But my repeated comments on testing have kind of been blown off, which made me suspicious that maybe they couldn't do it or didn't have a lot of success with it.\n\nSo, I did a ton of research online and found two new REs I wanted to talk to. One is local with an office in a high-end hospital, but I wasn't sure how it works if he's not part of a clinic in terms of the lab/etc. Another guy has a great reputation but he is in a clinic 3 hours away in Cancun. Well, turns out the first guy is actually partners with the second!  So I feel like that is a good omen. Crappy part is I'd have to go 3 hours away to do retrieval and transfer, but not the end of the world. The stimming/monitoring will all be done locally.\n\nThings I liked about the new guy:\n\n-He actually suggested supplements. Maca and stresstabs suggested for hubs sperm. He said even if it helps just a bit, it's worth doing. \n\n-He said he absolutely suggests PGS. Turns out my own clinic doesn't have in-house capabilities to do it. (nobody ever told me that outright). He knows my current RE and said he believes the protocol, etc, was good, but the lab isn't as modern and that limits the RE. Confirmed my suspicions there.\n\n-Was skeptical of why they did a testicular biopsy on hubs when it showed he had a count of 600,000. He himself has done IVF with fresh samples with 200k counts. Hubs is going to do 2 weeks of HCG shots again and then another SA to see if we could do IVF 3 with a fresh sample. If not, we will look to get the frozen one at the current clinic transferred.\n\n-Said he never does a 3-day transfer unless there were so few embryos that there was no choice (which was not the case for my IVF round 1). \n\n-Completely fluent in English. My Spanish is good but me and my current RE do this sort of Spanglish thing, and it's not ideal.\n\nSo, the decision is made! I'm going to follow my gut and we are switching to the new guy. \n\nHe said they usually do pgs on day 3 and fresh transfer on day 5. But I could do PGS day 5 and then do FETs if I want. The clinic has a lot of medical tourism which would explain why many patients  might not want to have to come back for FETs. \n\nI have no idea how this is going to go, but I honestly feel relieved and happy that I advocated for myself.

It started a chain of events that also led me to have an abdominal myomectamy in May.  My RE (who I went to for the myomectamy) also tested for fertility because my husband and I hadn't been trying, but also not preventing for four years.  Of course, my numbers are not so hot.\n\nWe finally got to the cycle where I was able to call for Clomid and set up all that jazz.  My husband and I discussed wanting to move forward with this plan.  I did everything I needed to do, including take time off work to make the two hour drive to my RE Wednesday for the ultrasound in which i was told I was good to go to trigger yesterday and have intercourse last night and definitely Saturday.\n\nMy husband works second shift but knew the plan was to have intercourse last night.  We tried and got nowhere.  This morning the OP showed positive (as to be expected).\n\nI'm so frustraed and hurt.  I feel like I've been scrambling around doing what I need to do for this and he has ONE thing to do and didn't do it.  \n\nMy questions: is this cycle shot?

I am 37 and was never aware of thyroid problems prior to IVF. That TSH of 4.97 was in Nov 2015 (Normal range for TSH is 0.4-4.40). They prescribed 0.05mg of Synthroid and it was life changing, short lived, but life changing. They wouldn't even allow us to begin the IVF meds before my thyroid levels were within normal range; THAT'S how important it apparently is in this case. This is what they told me anyway. They said they'd test again in 6 weeks. 6 week blood work came back within normal range so we started IVF. We were pregnant for a short time. They told us following testing that there were no chromosomal abnormalities, all was normal on that front. We haven't gone for a follow up appointment. In June I asked them to test my thyroid again because I was experiencing old pre-Synthroid symptoms - which I initially attributed to the IVF medication then pregnancy then miscarriage then possible hormone recalibration but things continued to worsen, especially the pain and anxiety/panic attacks. I called the clinic this week to double check the tsh results from my blood work and it turns out I've gone from having a hypothyroid with a TSH of 4.97 to having a hyperthyroid with a TSH of 0.24 all in 8 months.

We've been trying for nearly six years.  We started with a fertility clinic that was local to us where they didn't do any fertility testing at all (not even Normal hormone testing, no HSG, absolutely nothing) prior to putting me on 9 rounds of clomid and 3 rounds of femara over about a year and a half.  I didn't know enough at the time to push for more testing or know the damage that so many medicated cycles in such a short time would do. I ended up gaining nearly 80 lbs on clomid. After those 12 total rounds they referred us to an RE that was a little bit farther away from our home; he recommended we take a break from trying so I could lose the weight I had gained before we tried anything else.  Flash forward to last month- I have lost 100 lbs over the last year and a half. Also, found a new doctor that is highly recommended in our area.\n\nWent in for my first appointment in June where he ran a battery of tests, all which came back within normal ranges. At that first appointment I had gotten more information from him than with the last 3 doctors over a five year period.  Prior to this we were diagnosed with \"unexplained infertility\" and \"male factor fertility\". He diagnosed me with PCOS on the spot from an ultrasound that had been in my records from one of the prior doctors, who had never even mentioned PCOS. He also diagnosed me with endometriosis.\n\nWell Wednesday I went in for an internal and a HSG, yesterday I went in for a lap to have the endo removed. He had said there was a lot of endo right at the opening of my cervix and pretty severe endo throughout. He removed as much as he could. He also removed a staple from my appendectomy 11 years ago and some scar tissue from the same surgery. He then unblocked my right Fallopian tube and popped a bunch of the cysts on my ovaries.\n\nThese are my diagnoses just from within the last month-\n-anteverted uterus\n- endometriosis\n-PCOS\n-blocked right tube (unblocked during lap)\n\n((Seriously if you've read all of this, I appreciate it so much.))\n\nI'm feeling so duped and discouraged with all of the stuff that the other doctors missed.  I've been dealing with this shit for over 5 1/2 years and all of this could have been tested for and diagnosed in the beginning, instead of making me feel that it's some unexplained thing. This surgery could have been done 5 years ago to at least give us better chances.\n\nMy husband is going to go back in for a new semen analysis as well to see where his fertility sits.  He has also lost quite a bit of weight with me so we're hoping that may help on his side as well. \n\nWhat are likely to be our steps moving forward? I don't have a post op with him until late August, so I'm hoping to get some ideas on what we will do moving forward.  Will we be able to try IUI or will it be straight to IVF? How quickly will the endo return? Does an anteverted uterus affect fertility or pregnancy? How quickly can we start trying after the lap?\n\nThank you all so much for reading this and listening to me rant. I'm just feeling so lost and have lost quite a bit of faith in fertility doctors at this point.  My new doctor seems amazing though and I can't help but have a newfound hope on this ridiculously drawn out journey.\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Please help me make sense of all of this-5+ years and finally some answers, but a ton more questions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4u7kf7/please_help_me_make_sense_of_all_of_this5_years/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1469268158, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/4u7noe/saturday_off_topic_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4u7noe", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 190, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/4u7noe/saturday_off_topic_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1472981111, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything not necessarily related to infertility.

I have to say it's been very encouraging during our journey to read what others are going through. I think I am finally ready to introduce my issues and maybe get some advice...\nI have irregular periods. Like extremely irregular. So when I finally had one in April I thought it would be the perfect time to start charting and TTC. \nWell I started out optimistic but My period hasn't shown up since my last one in April. I take pregnancy tests like every other week and all are negative. So after almost 5 months of TTC and no Period and Negative tests I decided to make an appointment with an RE. She is supposedly the best in my area. \nMy question is...does anyone have any advice for me before I go to my first appointment with my RE? What is the best way to get the most out of it? It's in about a month and I don't want to waist any opportunity to get the most out of the appointment.

He also has a low-grade varicocele. We haven't been trying for long and our emotions have been all over the place since the diagnosis. \n\nAfter his diagnosis, the doctor gave him a bunch of supplements to try and increase his count, etc. Our next follow-up is in September and there we will be told whether we can do IVF or need ICSI(?). \n\nPoor husband hasn't been dealing with this well. I've been trying to be his rock but some days it's hard when he snaps at me. I'm hurting too and trying not to go to him with my sadness as he's dealing with a lot. \n\nI think it's partially the waiting. Waiting for the next SA and then moving forward. He's worried the next SA will also be abysmal and his sperm can't be used at all. I don't know what to do anymore to try and lift his spirits. I don't know how his next SA will go but I'm trying to remain positive. \n\nI'm just happy to have this sub.
