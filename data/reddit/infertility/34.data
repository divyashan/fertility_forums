As other intros go, I need to emphasize how appreciative I am of this sub. I graduated from a TFAB lurker and still-trying occasional poster (old account) pretty quickly.  The information on this sub was invaluable and motivated me to seek out a RE early and take a hard look at my results. \n\nMy husband and I have been trying for less than a year (since March), but I was motivated to do some initial testing with a RE after six months. Our initial diagnosis was a poor, but not abysmal SA for my husband and low-normal AMH for me (1.7). Since my AMH was low for my age and I have had very long cycles (but no PCOS) my RE offered (3) rounds of medicated IUIs. I asked her if I needed to do a HSG before that and she said no since there were no risks in my history. And I have to say, I really have no regrets about that. It was a three month delay to know what I know now, but my results are seemingly so rare (1-5% of population on the uterine finding) the practice really wouldn't mandate a HSG before this option. Also neither finding 100% impacts pregnancy rates, but one would theoretically make me potentially high-risk in OB. \n\nI had a HSG last Tuesday as protocol before moving on to IVF. My results are what appears to be a partially dilated left tube (causes unknown - no history of PID, abdominal surgery, etc) as well as a subseptate uterine configuration. The size of the septum is unknown at this time, but it doesn't appear (at least today) to be a full septum or bicornuate. I'm waiting to hear back from their MFM doctor that does 3D ultrasounds. I've been working thru the stages of grief about these findings, but in my RE's own words 'the sooner I accept these findings, the better I will be.' I believe in her. \n\nMy question is about the partially dilated tube. My RE is not completely convinced that it's 100% blocked, but there was no dye spill on the test. There's no apparent hydrosalpinx, but in the end it just might not be 'doing me any favors'. \n\nI'm going to meet with the RE after the 3D ultrasound to make a plan for next year. Basically do we do IVF before septum surgery and (hopefully) FET or vice-versa. And more importantly how do we decide to keep/remove the tube. It would mean a more invasive surgery (lap) and recovery time, but nothing crazy. \n\nFor those that have come across any similar situation with HSG tubal findings I would appreciate your thoughts. And really just any thoughts in general are always awesome :) ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Surprises in my HSG (not fun ones)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5hfcrd/surprises_in_my_hsg_not_fun_ones/"}, {"author": "ultra_luminal", "author_created_utc": 1389748430, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "38F TTC since 2013, 1 MMC, TWW IUI #3", "author_fullname": "t2_etcgz", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481320722, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5hgm0f/intro_better_late_than_never/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5hgm0f", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5hgm0f/intro_better_late_than_never/", "retrieved_on": 1484384890, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I've been mostly lurking and my whole story is lengthy and awful but I thought I'd chime in with where I am now and a bit of backstory how I got here. I've found just reading this sub and everyone's unique circumstances so comforting, so I thought even if it helped one other lurker, I should probably contribute. \n\nAfter an MC after an awful year of trying that ultimately set into motion my divorce, my cycle never really recovered back to where I was. The gist of it was that I stopped getting positive results on ovulation tests regularly (in 12 months, the tests claimed I ovulated 3 times) and so I thought there was no chance of me getting pregnant while I thought I wasn't ovulating. Boyfriend and I decide we want to start trying and I head to my RE looking for answers. He says, oh no, you likely HAVE been ovulating. So basically I find out boyfriend and I have been having well timed intercourse for almost a year with no success. So I'm stoked to not have had the anguish of knowing we were trying without success, but now I have it dumped on me that it's definitely time to step up the game. After a couple months of tests, RE finds boyfriend has motility issues and my numbers aren't great for egg quality/quantity. RE recommends 3 tries of IUI with Clomid and a trigger shot before we regroup for IVF. I had 2 good looking (maybe 18mm, I think?) and 1 less mature follicles for IUI #1 in November and I just got back from my ultrasound appointment where I had 2 more nice big ones (21.5 &amp; 18mm) and 4 other smaller eggs. Tonight we trigger, and IUI #2 is set for Sunday AM. Which means I test on Christmas morning. Oh goody. :\\/\n\nGreat news is boyfriend is fucking awesome. Just an emotional rockstar and I feel so lucky to have that.\n\nAnyway, I hate that we're all here, but I have to say, through all my lurking, seeing people graduate from here in the results threads, after they've been here for so long gives me a TON of hope.

I do not suffer from infertility myself but I have questions that have to do with it, so someone suggested me to post here. I hope it's not a problem if I do. (Also, I'm not an english native speaker, sorry if I make mistakes/am unclear)\n\nFirst, a bit of context. I recently learned that it was legal to donate eggs in my country (France); I hadn't even heard of it before but got curious about it after reading stuff on reddit. I have some close friends who struggle with conceiving and it makes them very unhappy; I am very lucky to have healthy eggs, so now that I'm aware I can actually give them to other people I have begun the process to do so. (Not to my friends, they're not dealing with an egg problem, but I wanted to help with the general issue)\n\nThe \"problem\" I have with it is communication. From previous experience (I've been a volunteer in a clinical study for an experimental HIV vaccine), I know that when I tell people about a heavy, constraining and painful medical process I'm going through while not \"needing\" it, it pretty much always devolves in an annoying conversation about how it's risky and I probably shouldn't do it. Or they just don't understand why I bother doing something so obviously uncomfortable. I guess I could just avoid talking about it, but it's hard when there are constraints that people will likely notice, and anyway that's actually something I'd like to raise awareness about.\n\nSo here are my actual requests, if you don't mind answering. I would like to have:\n\n1) Information about the whole process; the stimulation part is apparently the same one that women trying to have an IVF go through, so there are probably people on this sub who can tell me about it. I already had the point of view of my doctor but would like to hear about the experience of people who actually went through it. It could help me reassure people, explain them what's gonna happen to me, and also allow me to be better prepared.\n\n2) Information/arguments about WHY donating eggs (and also sperm) is important. I was pretty shocked to realize that in France we basically know nothing about these kinds of donation and there's a very serious lack of donors, so I would really like to advertise this possibility and stress the need for it. In France it's anonymous (so it means helping complete strangers) and donors are not paid, so I guess it doesn't leave much incentive to do it... But if I have stories to tell, or statistics, or anything I couldn't think about by myself, maybe I'll manage to make a little difference! It doesn't matter if whatever info you could give me is not about the situation in France, it's an universal problem anyway. \n\nAnother little question: is there a sub for egg donors? I couldn't find one. I have a few more questions that I don't think my doctor could answer, mostly about the feelings of everyone involved.\n\nI give you all my thanks in advance if you can give me a little help. And my apologies if this was not the right sub for my questions; if so, could you please tell me where to go?

Often, as failures and multiple cycles stack up, we find ourselves as the experienced hands, answering the questions of others, but it doesn't always feel like this is the right place for our own. Many of us are starting to very seriously explore our grief, be close to or at the end of the line in our treatment and seriously considering being childfree, adopting or fostering, but aren't quite done or aren't fully ready to leave the IF community. So I have created r/IFseniorclass. \n\nThis is in no way to exclude those who are newer to this process, it is simply a way of recognizing that the longer and deeper your journey goes the questions you have and the issues you grapple with change as well. I know that I will still contribute here at r/infertility just as much, but I felt a supplementary site might be helpful, in the way that r/stilltrying is often a good place for people too experienced for TFAB but not ready to come to us yet. \n\nSo, for those who are feeling like the last of your original cohort on here, who have had multiple failures stack up and who have been on this sub for a longer period of time and find many of the tips, questions and concerns here no longer quite address your unique needs, I welcome you to join me in creating this new sister community to this one. \n\nr/IFseniorclass\n\n ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've created a new sub for long-time members here (IFseniorclass)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5hz6v9/ive_created_a_new_sub_for_longtime_members_here/"}, {"author": "LordBidness", "author_created_utc": 1473569597, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36, Endo,7 IVF, 4 FETS, Retired with regret", "author_fullname": "t2_11brrf", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481582507, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5hztgh/are_hypothetical_due_dates_ever_rough_for_you/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5hztgh", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 28, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5hztgh/are_hypothetical_due_dates_ever_rough_for_you/", "retrieved_on": 1484395427, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I've been doing a lot better emotionally and mentally this cycle compared to my transfer/MC in November.

This is the same protocol as cycle 2.  Cycle 1 was a bust, and cycle 2 went better, so that's what we are sticking with.

Is there a chance I can over suppress?  I don't have DOR or POF, but my egg count tends to be on the low side because we are basically working with 1 ovary.  Is 1 month too long, or will the time not really matter?\n\n2) The past 2 cycles I've been on lo-dose HCG.  I hate that stuff..it makes me NUTS.  Last cycle I swear my hubby and our 2 100+ pound dogs hid for 2 straight days when they upped my dose from 20 to 50...I was just so angry all of the time.  When we had our WTF appointment with the RE, she said she'd consider switching me to menopur instead, and she wrote it down.  When I talked to my nurse this week, she said we were doing HCG.  I asked her to check with the RE, and she did, and they agree...HCG.  I don't know if RE forgot, or if something changed and she realized that the menopur was a no-go for me for whatever reason.  I can't decide if I want to push it or not.  For those of you who have taken menopur...any interesting side affects?  Anyone taken both?  Which is easier on moods.  I can handle physical symptoms much more than I can do the psychological ones.  I'd rather be in pain than be cranky and not be able to fix it.\n\nThanks guys!!

Since I'm 26 and have no prior pregnancy or history, my RE has not recommended PGS(yet). In fact, we've been planning for a fresh transfer. So now it seems a little late in the game to *start* the discussion about needing either PGS or PGD. \n\n\n I know the test through Counsyl is going to see if I'm a recessive carrier for any diseases, and if it flags anything then my husband will have the test. It seems good to have this knowledge, I am not against having this extra info. But if we are both recessive carriers for the same disease then we would need to do PGD, not just PGS, right? I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of being a genetic carrier for a disease, as it came out of left field and I'm not intending to do PGS at this point from a financial standpoint. I'm assuming mostly everyone has this test before starting IVF and it's standard procedure but now I'm worried about the added cost of PGD, which would be worth it, but I'm not sure if this is even a strong likelihood? \n\nSorry for scattered ramblings!

At 27 I came in and heard, \"You're so young.  PCOS is no big deal.  My PCOS patients get pregnant all the time.  You're gonna see.\"  I just turned 29, and after 8 cycles of clomid and femara, one unmedicated cycle, 2 IUIs, and an IVF retrieval that yielded 19 mature eggs (total of 6 frozen), I really thought I was finally getting close today on my first transfer day. I had a 3ab, I've been taking progesterone, and everything seemed good (minus a cold I've had, but they felt comfortable I could go forward in spite of it).  I'm always pessimistic because it never works out, but today I actually let myself feel hopeful.  I even got my photo of the embryo and I started crying happy tears.  It sounds stupid, but I let myself feel excited.\n\nAll the nurses I've talked to and everything I read pointed to it being a 10 minute procedure.  They worked on me for 5 hours and could not the catheter into my uterus.  An hour in, the doctor assured me that in her whole career she's never been unable to perform a transfer on a patient and that it was just a new challenge.  Four hours later, she finally got the narrow catheter in.  (Apparently, my cervix is twisted and too tight and a cyst that wasn't there a couple months ago was blocking the entrance to the uterus.)  So, they finally take out my beautiful embryo and for a moment I got to watch it on the big screen hatching, but when they went to put it in, they couldn't get the wider catheter in that contained the embryo and it got lost.  It might have ended up in my cervix, might have ended up caught in cervical mucus, but they couldn't find it and couldn't complete the transfer after what was essentially a 5 hour pap smear.   So, it's likely the embryo will disintegrate wherever it is.  \n\nI feel terrible, but I almost feel worse for my doctor who was beside herself that it happened.  She was really nice about it and got on the phone to call colleagues at other practices to see if they'd ever experienced this.  Apparently, consensus was that several had had one case of this in their careers.  I've never had a desire to be special in any way and I never wanted my fertility (or lack thereof) to be what set me apart.  The truth is, I didn't even think this transfer would lead to a baby.  I just thought that for a day or two, I'd get to have it inside me and be able to get a little closer to that dream.  \n\nTLDR: IVF transfer procedure took 5 hours and still couldn't be performed.

I feel like it might explain a little bit of my relief and fear (not that you all don't completely understand, because you totally know). \n\n\"I will be stimulating you very aggressively, aiming not only to generate the most vigorous response possible, but also because if we are not able to generate a reasonable response we will be more confident about concluding that cannot be achieved. Because you are rather unlikely to have a great response to stimulation, it is then less likely that we can expect to generate more embryos of quality than we would be prepared to transfer and that could then be frozen.  A scenario wherein one cycle of stimulation will yield not only one or two quality embryos for fresh transfer BUT ALSO others in a number sufficient for not only ONE but TWO later frozen embryo transfers seems very, very unlikely to me.  It is perhaps more likely that IF we can generate the response needed to get to retrieval and ultimately to embryo transfer, we will not have extras for freezing, which, if you don't conceive from the fresh transfer and we judge the effort worthwhile, might then be more likely to result in a new stimulation. I'm not sure this is helpful and I do wish that I could provide you with more certainty, but I can't.  I can only advise you on what I honestly think is most likely to happen.\" The TL;DR of this is, I don't expect you to have a good response to stims and if you don't, we'll have been as aggressive as possible, so it won't reasonably be worth trying again with your own eggs.\n\nNow, back to now... it's trigger day! I did 11 days of stims. My E2 is 2029 pg/mL and my P4 is 1.01 ng/mL and I have 6 (**SIX**) mature follicles and 4 smaller ones (still measurable (ie over 10mm), but not over 15).  So far this has exceeded my low expectations which, in turn, just makes me scared of the fucking hope. Retrieval at 8:30 on Friday morning. I feel like I'm getting greedy...I don't want to be devastated on Friday at retrieval, but I'm so overwhelmed at how well I've responded (comparatively) and I'm all hopeful that I'll get more than the 3 eggs that I decided were enough on stim day 5. And then, you know, the hunger games, and, omg all the scareds.\n\nMy protocol for reference: Estrace priming, Microdose lupron flare (20 units 2x/day) started at the same time as other stims (which seems different from most, but this might be because of how my clinic batches cycles), Gonal F 375 IU, Menopur 75 IU, 20 units human growth hormone (omnitrope).\n\nIncidentally, my amazing RE who did so much to get me here (and wrote that email above) and kept trying to start me in October and November and delaying me because of dumb cysts (telling me LIES that my ovaries are not working against me, lol). The last time I saw him, he prescribed provera for 7 days to fake a luteal phase to line up my start date right before thanksgiving. He promptly went on a cruise and has been gone the ENTIRE time from start to now, but apparently is attending tomorrow and doing my retrieval. I can't wait to see what he has to say and if he's pleased/excited/shocked/surprised/whatever. Is that weird?\n\nAnyway, this is long so I decided not to put it in the daily, hope that's ok.  \n\nETA: Will I need the percocet that they prescribe... or perhaps more importantly, IF I need it, will I need it right after retrieval (and I should get it filled today) or it'll be ok if I get it filled after leaving retrieval?\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Retrieval for IVF2 of this DOR poor responder is ON for Friday.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ic17i/retrieval_for_ivf2_of_this_dor_poor_responder_is/"}, {"author": "oh-no-varies", "author_created_utc": 1419354703, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "sick of this shit (IVF #1 failed)", "author_fullname": "t2_ka3u0", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481738965, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ic4d4/update_on_new_ifseniorclass_sub_including_rules/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ic4d4", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5ic4d4/update_on_new_ifseniorclass_sub_including_rules/", "retrieved_on": 1484402268, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi Everyone, \n\nThank you all for your patience while we got our little community up and running. For those of you that may have missed the earlier posts, we have created a new community r/IFseniorclass, for members of the r/infertility community who have been here for a long time, who have seen many of their original group here move on, and who might have different support and information needs than the majority of community members here on the main sub.\n\nWhile the main sub has really grown, which is great (we love that infertile people are finding support here!) it can make it more challenging to have some of the more intimate, personal and intense emotional explorations that some of the \"lifers\" need  later in their treatment. \n\nThe new sub is a \"Restricted\" community. This allows us to keep it open for lurking for our sister-members here on the main sub, but closed to only approved members for posting. With reddit's restricted settings, lurkers can comment on posts, so we ask that if you do not meet our eligibility requirements that you either refrain from doing so, or limit your participation to occasional commenting when appropriate. We also ask that you use the r/infertility daily thread for your own updates if you have not been approved to post in our sub or invited to participate in the daily thread. This is not to exclude others out of judgement or malice, rather to preserve the necessary intimacy of the smaller group as we begin to seriously explore the realities of being very late in the treatment phase of infertility and for many, nearing the end and shifting to fostering, adoption or childfree life.\n\n**Membership Eligibility Guidelines**\n\n* You must have a medical diagnosis of infertility, and should have received this diagnosis and been active in treatment for over one year. \n\n* You must have an established history as an active and contributing member of r/infertility for approximately one year. This will be verified with post history check. Active contribution means actively posting and commenting in a supportive and kind manner over this period.\n\n* You should have a history of multiple infertility interventions and/or experience, including multiple treatment methods, procedures etc. You do not have to have completed an IVF cycle, but posts with questions about your first IVF cycle if you choose to do one should be made on r/infertility.\n\n\n*If you meet 2 of the 3 criteria and feel strongly that you belong here, please message the mod team with your request to join. In an effort to maintain the safety and intimacy of our space, and to allow exploration of the different needs of longer-term infertility fighters, we may not approve your request, we may approve you to comment and post in the daily but not for self-posts, or may ask you to wait. This is not to exclude others, but to ensure this community's intimate nature is preserved as it was intended to be.*\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update on new IFSeniorClass sub, including rules and membership guidelines", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ic4d4/update_on_new_ifseniorclass_sub_including_rules/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481742790, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5icihw/why_do_i_have_a_dented_uterus/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5icihw", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5icihw/why_do_i_have_a_dented_uterus/", "retrieved_on": 1484402493, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Why do I have a dented uterus :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5icihw/why_do_i_have_a_dented_uterus/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481745681, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5icsx5/my_intro_why_vasectomy_reversals_suck/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5icsx5", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5icsx5/my_intro_why_vasectomy_reversals_suck/", "retrieved_on": 1484402663, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "My intro: Why vasectomy reversals suck", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5icsx5/my_intro_why_vasectomy_reversals_suck/"}, {"author": "kakavl", "author_created_utc": 1455215047, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "I collect full Sharps containers", "author_fullname": "t2_uo0t7", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481746485, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5icvuq/how_do_i_prepare_for_what_will_be_my_last_try/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5icvuq", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 32, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5icvuq/how_do_i_prepare_for_what_will_be_my_last_try/", "retrieved_on": 1484402714, "score": 12, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi, I'm new here.

We should start IVF! Oh wait no, all your test results are two years old because we'be taken so long to get around to you, we need day 1 bloods, and to redo your AMH, and day 1 ultrasounds. Oh, and your husband should wank into a cup again even though it's only been six months. Here's some cyclogest to get your period started, come back on the 1st of December and we will get started with IVF.\"\n\nThree days later I got pregnant. When my period never started after the cyclogest, I took a test and nearly threw up in surprise. Eight rounds of clomid in the space of a year had obviously made me slightly more fertile than usual.\n\nAt five weeks, I started bleeding. They told me to take the cyclogest pessaries again. Two days later the bleeding got worse. They checked my hCG levels, and declared that 20,900 at less than six weeks pregnant was super-high, and the pregnancy was definitely viable. They started giving me PIO injections. The next day the bleeding got worse, and I went to hospital. A doctor announced that my cervix was closed and it wasn't *that* much blood.\n\nFinally sent for an ultrasound at 5w6. I am still bleeding, and I know the baby is fucking gone. Naturally, in the maternity ultrasound suite where they do all the infertility and miscarriage scans, there are two heavily pregnant women! And wouldn't you know! They're both having twins! They coo conspiratorially about how much *better* having TWO ENTIRE BABIES is.\n\nI barely manage to stutter out \"I'm actually having a miscarriage. Could we please talk about something else.\" NATURALLY the response from one of the women is that probably I deserve it because I am SO MEAN and HATE JOY and am SO RUDE. Naturally, the staff wander in and out of the room while this woman is berating me, but choose not to do anything about it. I agree, I am mean and rude and hate JOY, please can we talk about anything else. (The answer is a resounding no, and I leave in tears when the topic turns back to 'they are SO WRIGGLY' and 'TWO ENTIRE BABIES'.)\n\nEventually they get round to scanning me without an extended wait in the Waiting Room Of Joy And So Many Babies. Empty sac. \"Maybe it's still too early!\" the Early Pregnancy Midwife cheerfully tells me. She takes a repeat hCG because no one else has, and the results are 13,000. \"It's still higher than expected, maybe you lost a twin!\" she tells me.\n\nRepeat ultrasound a week later: still an empty sac, but it's grown! And my hCG is now 27,000! It's doubled in a week! It's not that bad! The midwife was so optimistic. So were all the fertility nurses, who were giving me my daily butt injections. Everyone kept telling me how soooo many women bleed in pregnancy, and asking what I'm gonna name the baby.\n\nAround week six, I started getting nauseous. Really, really, really nauseous. \"Think of it as good news!\" three different nurses told me.\n\nThird ultrasound: empty sac, which hadn't grown. Finally everyone stops cooing at me that everything is probably fine, and I stop having to have butt injections.\n\nI go downstairs to the fertility clinic to tell them I don't need butt injections any more, and someone brings in a newborn baby to show off. I just fucking walk out. Naturally, there is a stall selling handknitted baby clothes right outside the fertility clinic.\n\nFourth ultrasound: suddenly they're all 'oh shit, maybe this is a molar pregnancy'. The Early Pregnancy Midwife is incredulous. She does another hCG test. It's 27,000. She rings me sounding panicked, makes an appointment for me to see an actual doctor at the hospital the next morning.\n\nThe doctor takes a lengthy history, puts his hand over mine and tells me that my pregnancy isn't progressing. *No fucking shit.* \"You must be six or seven weeks by now, and we can't see anything on the ultrasounds.\" he explains. I'm nine fucking weeks pregnant. It annoys me that he doesn't know that. He recommends a D&amp;C the next day, in case it is a molar pregnancy.\n\nI am very reluctant. I had a D&amp;C at 13weeks after a MMC in February, got a weirdly vague letter for a follow up six months later except they never answered their phone or returned my messages, so they haven't even checked that they didn't do any damage the first fucking time yet.\n\nBut I am Obediant, so I get up at 6 fucking am the next day to go to hospital to get my womb hoovered. The nurse seems surprised when I arrive. Twenty minutes later the nurse comes to find me, and takes me to an open ward.\n\nI sit down on the bed and start crying. At this point I have been crying pretty much constantly for weeks. The woman in the bed next to me, separated only by a curtain that reaches to about knee level, laughs and whispers to her boyfriend. I just about fucking lost it.\n\nMy husband goes to find a nurse, and calmly explains to the nurse that I am here very reluctantly for extremely traumatic and upsetting surgery, and I need to be in a private room, like I was last time. The nurse comes to tell me \"emergencies come in, we can't guarantee a private room\". I managed to blurt \"well I can't guarantee you access to my vagina\" before leaving.\n\nI have had e-fucking-nough. \n\nI knew at five weeks that this pregnancy wasn't fucking viable, and I have spent a whole month trying to persuade people of that fact. Now it's possibly cancerous - after they spent three weeks determinedly trying to make it grow with hormone injections! - and I am expected to submit to a hand up my vagina with a *fucking audience*.\n\nI'm considering paying actual money to get the D&amp;C done privately, though we can't really afford it. But honestly I'm mostly tempted to just... not doing anything. Is it completely irresponsible to just refuse to do anything, go anywhere, or talk to anyone? (Probably.) Should I consider a career in predicting the dismal future with horrifying accuracy while no one believes me? Is it unreasonable to just give the fuck up and assume that my eggs are made of fucking rocks?\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vent: literally the worst fucking month (cw: loss)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ij4hh/vent_literally_the_worst_fucking_month_cw_loss/"}, {"author": "my_pal_sal", "author_created_utc": 1460345654, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "32F|POF| DEIVF-TBA", "author_fullname": "t2_x2kd3", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481830283, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ijjb2/a_good_way_to_ask_for_support_from_family/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ijjb2", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5ijjb2/a_good_way_to_ask_for_support_from_family/", "retrieved_on": 1484406384, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Something has been bothering me lately - the lack of support from both of our parents while going through this bullshit. \n\nWe have a good relationship with both families and told both of them when we got the diagnosis that we would need to use donor eggs to have a baby.

We're slow to get to an RE due to my husband working away. Endo, PCOS, a very tilted uterus which shouldn't be a problem but is.\n\n\nWe initially did 6 rounds of clomid and then went straight to IVF. I've done two fresh IVF, one frozen transfer. My most recent round this month was slow growth in stims, only two useful follicles, went ahead with retrieval anyway (I go to a lower cost clinic so worth a shot). As part of low cost, retrieval is done conscious, with fentanyl to make you \"floaty\" and a local anaesthetic to the ovary. I've powered through a 16 egg retrieval before, so expected to breeze through 2. The fentanyl stopped working after 1 minute. The left hand side local didn't work. The right side did. I was pretty upset from the experience,  but one out of two fertilised and I geared up for transfer. That part is always easy!\n\n\nExcept it wasn't. It took three attempts to transfer the embryo. My uterus and cervix were particularly hard to access this time.  I've never had a problem before. This time there was repositioning speculums, painful probes to clear the path, and on the third attempt at transfer it no longer showed in the fluid when inspected.  I knew right there it was a bust and kept my expectations low. Doctors and nurses clearly panicking while trying to lighten the mood by saying \"this will be a strong, stubborn baby!\" (really helpful at a clinic that ONLY deals with IVF patients). \n\n\nThere was no implantation as I expected, but I had really positive WTF with the head doctor at the clinic. I'm going to go again in January, start as soon as clinic reopens after break, will get meds delivered now so I'm ready straight away. \n\nNow we're all caught up! I was coping pretty well all things considered. I have an amazing IF warrior-woman therapist who's helping me work through things, was feeling ok.  The medications arrived today, it's brought up a lot of unexpected emotions. I'm so keen to get going and get this shit-show back on the road, yet a bit scared and guarded against going through all that again (despite a completely different plan). I feel strong,  but not ready, still shaken from the trauma of last cycle and all of the conflicting emotions are exhausting. I'm trying to focus on one step at a time.
