While trial results provide evidence in favour of this procedure, there remains some uncertainty about both the extent of any beneficial effect and the subgroups of women most likely to benefit.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\n\nCross-sectional survey with responses from a total of 143 public and private fertility care providers surveyed between August and October 2015.\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS\n\nAn online survey was distributed to all 189 fertility clinics across Australia, New Zealand and the UK. All clinicians, nurses and embryologists were eligible to take part. One hundred and forty-three of the 152 responses received were eligible for inclusion, with multiple responses per clinic in 33 cases. At least one response was received from 68 clinics (36% response rate per clinic).\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\n\nThis survey found that 83% of clinicians commend endometrial scratching prior to IVF. Of these, 92% recommend endometrial scratching to women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and 6% recommend it to all women having IVF. Most respondents (73%) agreed that the procedure is beneficial in women with RIF undergoing IVF and disagreed (53%) that the procedure is beneficial for women undergoing their first IVF cycle. The most common timeframe for performing endometrial scratching is the luteal phase of the cycle prior to the IVF cycle. Additionally, only 4% of clinicians recommend endometrial scratching to women undergoing intrauterine insemination or trying to conceive naturally.\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\n\nFertility care providers who recommend endometrial scratching may be more likely to respond to the survey and this could exaggerate the use of the procedure reported here.\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\n\nThis study was conducted across three countries and may be generalizable to similar settings. While this procedure already appears to be offered by the majority of respondents, the results of further studies in this area may further refine or expand the context in which this procedure is beneficial.\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)\n\nNo funding or competing interests.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\n\nN/A.\n\nendometrial scratching, endometrial injury, endometrial pipelle, endometrial biopsy, IVF, recurrent implantation failure, recurrent failure", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wednesday Journal Club Topic: RIF", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6u57pk/wednesday_journal_club_topic_rif/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "MollyElla511", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "Really good at failing - IVF #3 Oct", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1502928851, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6u6ahv/upcoming_ivf_retrieval_cycles_fets_october_cycle/", "id": "6u6ahv", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 114, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6u6ahv/upcoming_ivf_retrieval_cycles_fets_october_cycle/", "retrieved_on": 1503010979, "score": 9, "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm counting down the days until we start our next IVF retrieval cycle.

My wife and I have been struggling with infertility for about 4 years. In January of 2014 she had an emergency surgery when we found out she had endometriosis. The doctor removed as much as he could at the time, but the left ovary was still stuck to the uterus. She had another surgery in January of 2015 and the removed more adhesions, but knew it would be an ongoing issue.\n\nMonths go by and we continue to struggle with infertility, but doctors keep telling us it's possible. But they say things like \"you're a great candidate for IVF\" which is... one way of putting it. Another way is, \"you won't be able to get pregnant unless you do IVF.\" We don't have the money for that though. She is going back to school for nursing right now and I am a wedding photographer. We aren't exactly swimming in the big bucks.\n\nLast August, she started finding blood in her stool and was concerned. The doctor had her get a colonoscopy and the colonoscopy doctor said going into the procedure \"I've never seen endometriosis spread to the colon. You're fine. It's probably just a hemorrhoid.\"\n\nGuess what? It was endo. Pretty bad actually.\n\nOur fertility doctor suggested we go through IUI treatments in 2017 after a few months of Lupron to prepare her body for it. Those didn't work and that brings us to today.\n\nShe's waking up now and the doctors met with me over the past couple hours. The doctors spent 5 hours in the operating room. The endometriosis doctor removed a lot of endometriosis (one adhesion or maybe cyst, everything is blurring together now, was 10cm) There's still more on her diaphragm that the doctor called \"aggressive\". She wasn't comfortable removing without a cardiologist (or something like that) in the operating room. So there are more surgeries in the future.\n\nThe doctor removed her left fallopian tube today and had to sew up her left ovary. The right side looks \"okay\" but the doctor still recommends that we pursue pregnancy ASAP and \"IVF should be at the top of our list\". She also said that her case of endometriosis may be the most aggressive she's ever seen.\n\nShe also had about 6 inches of her colon removed today and the colon doctor said the colon was covered in endometriosis. He stitched it back together and she'll be recovering in the hospital for the next 4-5 days.\n\nI don't have a whole lot else to say other than I feel... gutted? Is that a good word for this?

Next morning (Tuesday), went to work and can barely walk. Called my RE around 1030 because pain was unbearable, tell her my symptoms and they asked me to go straight to the nearest ER. At the ER they ran a bunch of tests finding that I have \"extensive deep vein thrompbosis and pulmonary embolism\" caused by all the hormones I have been putting in my body for the past month and a half. Got admitted two days ago to the ICU, where doctors try to help my condition and at the same time treat me as if I were pregnant. First beta is not until Monday.

I apologize for the formatting, I'm on my cell, and emotionally drained. \n\nRefresher:\n\nDr. Smith- a therapist I was seeing before and during IVF 1. Last time I saw her I was 6w and she did not know about my loss\n\n\nDr. Jane- a former coworker who is also a psychologist. She recommended Dr. Smith to me, I was not aware that they were close friends at the time. \n\n\nBasically- I have found out that Dr. Jane, despite having two coworker's say I'm not pregnant, has continued to ask other coworker's of mine if I'm pregnant, telling them she 'heard a rumor' I was. Apparently, on Tuesday Dr. Jane called my friend one cubicle over to gossip about our office and asked her about this. She is friends with me and shut that shit down. Today, I am walking through the lobby and I see Dr. Jane and I confronted her. I asked her who told her I was pregnant and she said she 'didn't remember'. That's all she would say, over and over. I knew instantly that she was covering her own ass, and realizes that I knew Dr. Smith told her. She apologies and said that she simply wanted to know so she could *knit me a baby blanket*. I was like, then why not **ask me directly**. I very calmly, but in the most intense voice I've ever used, explained that I *was* pregnant, but I had a misscarriage, and every single time someone comes to my desk and asks me about it, because she told them I was pregnant, it is ripping open the wound. I was unrelenting in explaining the pain she has continued to cause me. When I finished and walked away she was literally speechless. \n\n\nCut to two hours later. She **called me on my work phone** to tell me, while crying, how she was sorry, and remembered she had in fact told the biggest gossip queen (who is also a massive judgmental bitch that I've had lots of problems with) that she heard I was pregnant, despite previously denying doing this. I once again lost it. I explained that calling me at my desk, in the middle of the day, to further discuss this, was hurting me and she needed to stop. She offered to call people and tell them she was wrong, but I told her no because it's too late. \n\n\nBack to Dr. Smith. She never responded to my email asking if she disclosed the information to Dr. Jane. Then tonight she left me a voicemail saying she'd like me to call her back to discuss the email. My question is- what do I do? I honestly and done discussing my deepest pain with these women. Should I email her back and say do not call me? I was tempted to say 'if you can't confirm or deny that you shared this information, I have no desire to talk to you'. \n\n\nAlso, I told Dr. Jane that I was reporting this to HIPAA and 'they can sort it all out' and I think that's why Dr. Smith is calling me. \n\n\n\nOk guys, sorry for this massive story. You're the only people I can really talk to about it and I'm losing my mind. I hate dealing with this type of confrontation and I just want it to be over. I don't think my HIPAA complaint will go far because it's a 'he said she said' and they're denying it, but I'm more resolved than ever to fight this.

Husband's numbers are good but not great, though we never had fragmentation tested. \n\nI was seeing a RE for a couple of years with several (5?) failed TI cycles with Femara and then 3 failed IUIs (two with injectables); she didn't recommend IVF. All that was finished in August 2016 and after that we had vague plans to see another RE. \n\nLast fall some things that had been bothering me for years suddenly seemed to get worse: fatigue, forgetfulness, cognitive issues, bone pain (especially in my legs). I honestly thought I was getting early-onset dementia. For example, I was trying to describe [something similar to this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9f/6c/69/9f6c69311368c04d3c8133a7d81e47f8--pole-barn-shop-metal-pole-barns.jpg) to my husband but couldn't recall the words Barn, Metal, Siding, or Red. It was that bad. I had trouble finishing sentences and explaining things. \n\nI have a family history of heart disease and I've found several issues through 23andme's genetic testing (MTHFR, Hemochromatosis) so I went to see new General Practitioner (had to start somewhere, right?) to see what was going on. \n\nBasic labs in December 2016 immediately showed a very high calcium level which in the end turned out to be caused by hyperparathyroidism which was caused by a parathyroid tumor. (Girls, if you have a high calcium level do your own research - http://www.parathyroid.com/ is a great resource and a high calcium level is 99.9% of the time caused by an operable tumor.)\n\nI had surgery to remove the tumor within 3 months; the surgeon estimated the tumor had been there 5-8 years. I had copies of labs from 2012 showing high calcium levels. . . this problem had been ignored by 2 General Practitioners, an Ob-Gyn, and the RE (a fucking endocrinologist missed a pretty obvious endocrine tumor. . . it kills me) over several years. The surgeon said that while she couldn't say whether the chronic hyperparathyroidism was the primary cause of my infertility, it was a definite hindrance to conception and pregnancy. \n\nMy other labs done in December 2016 were largely unconcerning except for a TSH of 4.7. My Dr said it was in range despite several signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. :/ My RE had said a TSH of 1-2 was optimal for conception but I wasn't seeing the RE anymore and the current Dr wouldn't do any further testing, saying \"TSH is the gold standard\" of testing thyroid health. \n\nA few months ago I decided to order some tests on my own. A full thyroid panel showed a TSH of 3.88 and a DHEA-s and Cortisol panel showed low/very low DHEA levels and 3 of 4 cortisol levels were [too low](http://i.imgur.com/WNwrwUE.png?1). I started researching what all this meant and I really don't know what to do! The thyroid and adrenals play a huge part in fertility but I'm having trouble finding a Dr that know what to do with this. \n\nIt seems as if I definitely have hypothyroidism by newer ranges (my Dr still goes by the old 0.5-5.0 is \"normal\") and some type of adrenal dysfunction/fatigue (adrenal fatigue is still not recognized at all by many doctors). I've reached out to a Dr who deals with bio-identical hormone replacement but if anyone has any experience or knowledge regarding this I'd love to hear it. \n\nThanks!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adrenal fatigue and infertility?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6udixr/adrenal_fatigue_and_infertility/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads"}, {"author": "RC_2017", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503011298, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1503011568, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6udtr5/invocell/", "id": "6udtr5", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6udtr5/invocell/", "retrieved_on": 1503095559, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone tried it?

It did not go well, was very painful, and then I found out that neither lab could run the tests, they only got cervical tissue in the biopsy. \n\nSo my doctor apologized like crazy.

Compound that with the time lost and I'm just fucking pissed. I really did not think the tests would come back showing any issues because I have ENOUGH issues for it to be really tough to get pregnant.

I was also on Cetrotide to suppress ovulation until the trigger. I was triggered with Decapeptyl instead of HCG as it is supposed to virtually guarantee no OHSS. However, I had to come in the day after the trigger shot to make sure it worked (it did).\n\nWill do freeze-all. I had at least 16 large follicles and another dozen smaller ones at the last u/s.\n\nI did not like my egg retrieval process.  Clinic was running late so had to sit around for a good 30 mins being nervous and doing nothing.  When the nurse finally came, she struggled getting my IV in and got it in the wrong spot which hurt so much. After 2 more attempts she finally got it right.\n\nIn the OR, I got some fetanyl (so conscious sedation, not out completely), it was a good drug but near the end i wanted more as i could feel the pressure, like very strong cramps and a bit of poking. They also froze the vaginal wall. \n\nI think because i had a lot of eggs it took a bit longer and so the drugs wore off.  I did ask for more drugs but the Dr was like we are almost done, but goddamn him i would have been fine to have a little more. I was saying OW OW OW a lot near the end LOL. (I think partly its just knowing what is happening is the painful part).\n\nIn the end they retrieved 25 eggs, 15 mature, and 14 fertilized.

Google says it's a known side effect but I'm curious if anyone here had that.\n\n2. I've read every thread about HSGs and am so anxious but also aware that not everyone has a horrible experience.

I'm part of a different IF board, but there was recently a big blowup of the main forum and we lost a ton of members in the carnage, so I'm looking for somewhere that's more active.  \n  \nA quick background: I'm 25, H is 28. We've been TTC #1 since March 2014.  \nOur diagnosis: slight MFI (low count, low morph), anovulatory, and debatable DOR (this was my first diagnosis when my AFC was 0&amp;6 and my AMH was on the low side, but numbers have since improved, so my new RE doesn't think this is a factor). I have my suspicions of poor egg quality due to very low fertilization/survival rates.  \n  \nWe've done 3 rounds of IUI/Letrozole, 2 IVF/ICSI (1 in the Czech Republic, 1 at our home clinic here in Canada), and 1 FET after IVF #2 which resulted in a +, but ended in a MC at about 7 weeks. Went through an unmedicated \"mini D&amp;C\" (so dubbed by my clinic). Betas still weren't dropping, so then I had to go in for the methotextrate injection. Took another 6 weeks for betas to finally zero out. Good times. \n  \nWe're about to start another round of IVF/ICSI (which will also be our last, since we've been 100% OOP since day 1 and our finances are at their end).  \n  \nSo yeah, that's pretty much the Reader's Digest version of my slacking reproductive system. Hope you all don't mind me hanging around here :) My posting will probably be extremely erratic (if I know myself at all), but I'll be around as often as I can :)  \n  \nETA: I tried so hard and still triggered the bot.

I'm 35, BMI of 40, have polycystic ovaries, and a beard (but lack other symptoms of PCOS). I've never been pregnant before.  I ovulate regularly and have an AMH of 3.1.  RE recommends IUI with donor sperm.]\n\nA couple weeks ago I saw my RE for office hysteroscopy and a sono-salpingogram (hope I spelled that correctly!). This is the normal diagnostic workup they do for everyone who walks in the door. I was diagnosed with a uterine polyp (sessile, partly blocking the opening of my right ovary). It was recommended I have said polyp removed via hysteroscopy.  Sure. Fine. \n\nMy insurance pays for a little bit of infertility treatment (50% of the first $4000). I have about half of that left after the initial appointment and the diagnostic procedures.  The financial counselor at the clinic said that she thought it would be coded as medical (not infertility) and thus I would only have my regular copay. \n\nI got my period today and called the clinic to schedule the polypectomy. As usual, I left a message with the receptionist and was expecting a call back from the nurse to make the appointment. Instead I got a call back from the financial counselor that the procedure was coded as infertility treatment and that my out of pocket cost would be about $6000. (!). She recommended I message my PCP/NP and tell them about the polyp, not mention the infertility, and see what happens. She also said I can appeal the decision with my insurance. \n\nSo I spent my busy day today considering the following options (in order of preference):\n\n1. Keep the damn polyp and move forward with the IUI and see what happens. (Research says that polyps can hinder implantation, but the research isn't decisive.)\n\n2. Appeal the decision with my insurance.  (Anyone have any tips?  I have decent insurance and am relatively healthy, so I've never had to deal with this before.)\n\n3. Message my PCP and see if they can make a recommendation/referral.  (I did this, but haven't heard back yet.)\n\n4. Make an appointment with an OB/GYN and see if they could remove the polyp as a medical treatment. \n\n6. Pay the $6000 and have it done. \n\n7.  Pretend that it's causing issues and see what happens. (In fairness, when my uterus/ovaries twinge, it is usually the side with the polyp.)\n\nThoughts?

Tricare agreed to cover 80% of cost for the antibiotic (our co-pay $4.69), Pregnyl trigger shot (our co-pay $24), pain medication (our co-pay $1.18), Cetrotide to prevent ovulation (our co-pay $24), and 8 Minivelle Estradiol patches to wear during suppression instead of birth control pills (our co-pay $10.00). Tricare would not pay anything toward Gonal-F or Menopur. I can provide how much I paid for those two if people are interested. I was not charged for syringes, alcohol wipes, or the sharps container.\n\nI will hopefully be transferring a frozen embryo after I have my tubes removed this fall, so I do not yet have an estimate for PIO (progesterone in oil) or other medications I may need to prepare for that.\n\nIf I have missed something important, let me know and I will update this post.

I know it's largely the same drugs and our problem hasn't changed any, but it makes me feel more defeated and more afraid that it will never happen for us. I'm anxious about the actual process of IVF, I hate being put out and get really tense thinking about it.

This will probably be long. \n\nHusband and I (31, 29) have been trying for just over a year now. We went to see an RE in the winter after my second chemical. Husband was diagnosed with mild MFI after a sperm analysis, preliminary tests show things are okay on my end. We tried two monitored natural cycles that were not successful. \n\nOur first IUI cycle in April worked and I got pregnant. A few stressful ultrasounds later, where the heartbeat never went past 81 bpm, we discovered at 8 weeks the embryo stopped growing at 7 weeks. I had a D&amp;C and misoprostol a few days after the procedure to remove retained tissue. Pathology showed Turner's Syndrome. \n\nAfter a sono in June to ensure my uterus was clear, I was given the go-ahead for our next IUI cycle. Clomid didn't work as well as last time for me and I only had one small follicle. The clinic also missed my ovulation day because they fucked up, so the IUI got cancelled. I somehow still managed to get pregnant. My betas were progressing very well, tripling within 48 hours. \n\nOne night I started bleeding heavily, accompanied by painful cramping. You can read about this in my history, but I was diagnosed with a very large subchorionic hematoma and ordered to bedrest. A few ER trips later (I lost a lot of blood and lost consciousness from the pain), we found out we lost the baby and had another D&amp;C at 6 weeks with tissue testing. We're still waiting on that now. \n\nSo. Now we've done all the blood work for recurrent pregnancy loss and hoping the results come in soon. My biggest fear is that they'll find nothing wrong with me and this will just keep happening. But I'm also hoping that we don't have to move onto IVF, because to us that is a last resort (it's expensive, and although the first one is covered by our provincial government, I'm scared it won't work the first time or that I won't produce enough eggs). \n\nBasically I'm just all around scared. I'm tired, I break down and cry all the time. I completely shut down at Costco today because I saw like, 6 pregnant women within 5 minutes. Literally all my coworkers in my department have had a baby and/or gotten pregnant within the last year. I dread going to work because of this, and because I had to let my superiors know what was going on with me. And my sister in law is due any day now with her honeymoon baby. I'm ashamed, and I feel like a failure. \n\nThere is definitely something wrong with me. My RE thinks so. Statistically, if everything was ok, I'd have had a baby by now, but I don't. IVF terrifies me but I know that's probably our best option if we have unexplained infertility. I don't know what I'll do if this happens to me again. I cannot emotionally handle it, and I don't feel like myself anymore. \n\nSo that's my story. Although I wish I never had to come here, I'm thankful this place exists. If anyone else is here with recurrent pregnancy loss, I'd love to hear your stories and current treatment plans.

For my husband and I, I've always been interested in adoption and was very open to it at some point in time I thought after we had a biological child.  He was also open to adoption, so it for us seems like a way to start a family if the bullshit treatments never work for us. We are at the point of not being able to pursue more treatment at the moment, but if we do I feel so strongly about adoption we will pursue it anyway. Is it a calling or an intuition that I've always known I would be unable to have my own children? Maybe, maybe not. All I know is we want a family, and if it's formed through adoption I will be no less happy than if I had a biological child.

Marijuana has previously been linked to reduced adult testosterone, however, a study in Denmark reported increased testosterone concentrations among marijuana users. \n\nThis study was performed to estimate the effect of marijuana use on testosterone in U.S. males. Data on serum testosterone, marijuana use, and covariates for 1577 men from the 2011\u20132012 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed. \n\nInformation on marijuana use was collected by a self-administered computer-assisted questionnaire. \n\nSerum testosterone was determined using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. \n\n\nThe effects of marijuana use on serum testosterone concentrations were examined by frequency, duration, and recency of use. \n\nAdjusted means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of serum testosterone across levels of marijuana use were estimated using multiple linear regression weighted by the survey weights. The majority (66.2%) of the weighted study population reported ever using marijuana with 26.6% reporting current marijuana use. \n\nThere was no difference in serum testosterone between ever users (adjusted mean = 3.69 ng/mL, 95% CI: 3.46, 3.93) and never users (adjusted mean = 3.70 ng/mL, 95% CI: 3.45, 3.98) upon multivariable analysis. \n\nHowever, serum testosterone was inversely associated with time since last regular use of marijuana (p-value for trend = 0.02). \n\nWhen restricted to men aged 18\u201329 years, this relationship strengthened (p-value for trend &lt;0.01), and serum testosterone was also inversely associated with time since last use (p-value for trend &lt;0.01), indicating that recency of use, and not duration or frequency, had the strongest relationship with testosterone levels. \n\nSerum testosterone concentrations were higher in men with more recent marijuana use.
