This round, I went in for a mid-cycle scan and I had two follicles @ 12.5mm. The next morning blazing positive and trigger, IUI the next day.\n\nMy question is, do you think the nurse is missing a follicle on the US since my ovary is so hard to see?

It was only labs so I didn't get to talk to my OB at all. I briefly mentioned all of my negative OPK's to a MA and she agreed that it was unlikely that I ovulated this cycle. Well yesterday was CD22 and I had EWCM for the first time this cycle, however I do have EWCM at least once every cycle and I haven't been ovulating for a long time. Today though, CD23 I am having very painful cramps on my left side. I just can't help but think it can only be ovulation pain (which I've never had before) but isn't CD23 too late to ovulate on Femara?? I just feel so confused and came find any help online.

Only pregnancy related test results are limited to this thread.\n\nYou can post the outcome of your pregnancy related tests here, positive or negative. However, **if a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&amp;C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, discussion can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** \n\nPlease keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same head space, so take the lead of each poster about what they need. This is a safe space for those who have experienced infertility*, regardless of treatment type or status, to discuss the first stage that comes after a positive pregnancy result. Discussions of positive beta and/or HPT results, beta hell, beta limbo, or very early pregnancy concerns are to take place in this thread.   Do not post images of HPT tests. An appropriate place to share photos of HPT tests is /r/TFABlineporn.\n\n* Infertility includes:  primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss.\n\nFor a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).\n\n**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top \"Read This\" sticky on the main page.** \n\nOnce fetal heartbeat has been confirmed or you have graduated from RE, we encourage you to look for support and continue sharing your story at our sister community, /r/infertilitybabies. You may also be interested in posting at /r/whatworkedforme.  You are always encouraged to share your non-pregnancy-related infertility experiences and continue to support other community members here on r/infertility.\n \n In order to keep this thread from getting overwhelming:\n\n- Edit your original post with any updates instead of posting again.

If you're on mobile you can find this under \"About Community\" at the top of the page (look for the three dots in the upper right corner).\n\n**Mention of pregnancy or positive results** post treatment is only permitted in the results thread. Vague and sensitive mentions to \"success\" are welcome only when context permits (ex. someone asking if someone had success with a protocol, and a user replies \"I had success with A,B,C\"). Unsolicited mentions of pregnancy or live children are against the rules to ensure that this space is safe for people in their various emotional states. Unsolicited mentions does include flair, please keep success/pregnancy mentions out of your flair.\n\n**Secondary infertility** and those with prior success are allowed to participate here. Prior success may be mentioned in regards to medical history or introductions. Be mindful of the phrasing used when referring to success. It does not go over well when someone uses \"blessed\", \"miraculously,\" \"easily conceived\", etc to explain their success. Be mindful that the majority of our members are childless, not by choice. Casual mentions of a child are not generally well received and may be removed.\n\n**Be kind to one another**. There are no Pain Olympics on this sub, but do try to be aware of not punching down. Someone who has not yet experienced the situation of another should be aware of judging the feelings or actions of someone who is further along in the ART process. Each step, each failure, each escalating treatment brings new pain. We recognize the difficulties of all kinds of infertility, from clomid to donor IVF, please be sensitive when you respond to others and be mindful of what they have been through to get to this place.\n\nThis is a **science-minded, realistic, and sometimes cynical sub**. There are many communities online for people who want a more \"positive\" or \"upbeat\" experience complete with baby du$t.  People who do not feel they belong in those spaces often feel deep relief to have found our realistic, pragmatic, and science-focused space and we do our best to ensure that it retains this quality. We welcome all kinds of discussions, but you may find this sub's audience less receptive to diet/natural/home remedies/cures as most people here are experiencing diagnosed medical infertility (including unexplained).\n\nSex, embryos, and sperm.

Although we've produced lot of embryos, we lose 50% of our embryos to a genetic disorder  and several more to PGS.\n\n\nI've been through 2 cancelled ERA mock FET cycles and 1 cancelled FET cycle due to lining issues. My clinic has not let me try a \"natural\" FET and seems adverse to them. Instead, I've tried 2 cancelled mock FETs for ERA with various doses of vaginal estrogen and one cancelled FET (physician decided to stop pursuing the ERA) with 2 weeks of Lupron followed by vaginal estrogen. I decided to take a breather in October and resume FETs in January.\n\n\nWe found out our insurance next year will cover IVF! So we're considering doing another retreival  and looking at other clinics that are out of state and would require remote monitoring/travel. However, the out of state clinic I spoke with today recommended transferring embryos where they were created rather than shipping them to another clinic. This means if I want to use my existing embryos my current clinic would need to transfer them.\n\n\nI don't really want to go through another retrieval since my last one resulted in zero useable embryos and benched me for awhile due to moderate OHSS. We'd like two kids but at this point I'd be happy with one.\n\n\nShould I try to transfer what I have locally before switching clinics and doing another retrieval? Should I push harder to ship my embryos to the new clinic if I go forward with them? Should I just do another retrieval locally?\n\n\n**TLDR**:  2 frozen embryos banked.

MY FSH is 10.7 IU and I had 3 follicles. I am 34. I've seen the charts that my dr showed me and people in their 40s don't even have AMH this low. I don't fully understand what this means and would love if if someone spells it out for me in plain blunt English. Here are my questions. \n\n* What does it mean to have 0.14 AMH? Does this mean there's a chance I won't have my own biological kids if my FSH doesn't decrease? \n* Has anyone been able to decrease their FSH so that they are able to produce good quality eggs? I'll be working very very hard on that and have the book 'it starts with the egg'\n* Does a low AMH mean I have few eggs? \n* Can I still increase my AMH or is it really too late for me?\n* Why is my AMH so low?

I really like your vibe here of no cutesy-ness, and I hope to be an active member here!\n\nI'm going through a psychologically rough patch after my first IVF frozen cycle and I'm wracked with indecision and wanted to get some thoughts from people who might be/have been in my shoes.\n\nI was happy/grateful to get 3 PGS normal/euploid blasts from my first cycle, which is one more than average for my age (36). However, when I got the live birth rates from my RE and genetic counselor, I became worried the percentages would not be enough for the 2 children I dreamed of. It feels like nearly a coin flip. In particular, I'm freaked out about the scenario where FET #1 would be successful, but #2 and #3 wouldn't, and I would have lost all that time and be 38.5 or 39 doing IVF again (with a small child, a career that's hopefully on the upswing, having to rush through breastfeeding, and likely a lot of anxiety).\n\nRight now my husband and I are trying to decide between:\n\na) doing another IVF cycle to bank more blastocysts (best case scenario: we have the blasts we need in some order for 2 kids and I can proceed with much less anxiety; scary scenario: excess embryos which would weigh on us for years.)\n\nb) proceeding to FET (best case scenario: we DO have just the right # of blasts but just don't know that for sure going in; scary scenario: as mentioned above, lost time with a successful #1, unsuccessful #2/3, IVF again older, and no guarantee of a second kid)\n\nc) do a frozen \\*egg\\* cycle only. My husband already has frozen sperm. My RE did not bring this up; I did as a possible \"middle ground\" where we'd only move on to fertilization if needed. She warned us it's far from a sure-thing insurance plan, with fewer eggs surviving a thaw than embryos and more unknowns with the freezing, thawing, re-freeze for PGS.\n\nAdditional stats:\n\n* I'm 36.5, my husband is 44.5\n* Diagnosis MFI, no other known issues except my hypothryodism which will be controlled carefully before transfer\n* No history of past known pregnancies for either of us\n* I apparently have high AMH for my age\n* Morphology of euploid blasts: 6-day 3AB, 5-day 3BB, another 5-day 3BB\n* Statistics given to us of live births: 65%, 60%, 60% respectively\n* Retrieval was 15 eggs (all mature), 10 fertilized normally (2pn), 6 blastocysts, 3 PGS normal (1 mosaic we're cautioned is very unlikely, and 2 aneuploid)\n* Crazily, the sex of all 3 PGS blasts (and the 1 mosiac) are all the same. It's the sex I was NOT expecting or ever imagined having, but I'm coming around to it and realized I would be happy with children of any sex/gender/gender expression and don't want that to be a determining factor.\n\nI've been through every scenario in my head hundreds of times. My anxiety is nearly unmanageable right now (though I'm getting professional help). This feels like the most significant and difficult decision of my life. I feel strongly one way one day and another the next. Two kids is my dream (sibling relationship very important in my life) and I regret getting started so late. \n\nHusband and I not religious but scared about the emotional ramifications of unused embryos, and I think the feeling we took it too far \"playing god\" or something. The root of the dilemma I think is ultimately our ambivalence is how we view these 100-cell clumps -- as a future child we really want to get to know, or a possibility/step along the way to build our family. \n\nIf I'd gotten 2 blasts I know I'd be doing another IVF cycle; if I got 4 I would almost definitely proceed to FET with excitement. 3 seems like the hardest number with no guarantees, yet I've grown attached to the idea of them.\n\nNot having a plan is kind of torturing me. The whole \"I have embryos outside of my body\" thing is weirder than I thought. I also thought IVF would give more control but instead it feels like an illusion of control, with so many unknowns. I feel like I have to plan my whole life now and I'm petrified, physically nauseous and heart-racing for long stretches of each day.\n\nThank you for reading this lengthy post, and I appreciate comments of all types -- what you would do, what you did, how you feel about your frozen blasts, general support. I look forward to connecting with you all on other topics as well!

I have been tested for autoimmune dxs, genetic karyotyping (my husband has not done karyotyping), as well as all other infertility testing- including endometriosis, HSG, sonohystogram etc -Everything has come back normal. My husband has done 4 semen analyses and all have come back normal as well. We are both 31 years old and healthy. I am a non-smoker, have a healthy/fertility-friendly diet, and don\u2019t consume much alcohol or caffeine. I take Co-Q10 and prenatal vitamins with no synthetics daily.  I have tested my amh levels and recently got tested for pre-menopause (still waiting on those results). Other than my stress-level being probably high from TTC, I\u2019ve never had any medical issues. My GYN has even joked that I\u2019m like a poster for fertility, but for some reason, I still can\u2019t get pregnant. \n\nMy husband and I decided to stop doing IVF and continue trying naturally and for the last 3 consecutive cycles, I have had timed intercourse with confirmed ovulation (through OPKs and day 21 progesterone blood test) and have experienced what I believe to be implantation spotting on either 7-8dpo or 8-9dpo. Last cycle I got a vvvfl 11dpo (I know it could have been a false-positive but given ovulation confirmation, timed intercourse,\nAnd implantation symptoms, I think that was a vvvvfl) then the line disappeared and I got my period 14dpo. This cycle I didn\u2019t test early, but had implantation spotting on 8-9dpo, and just got my period 11dpo. \n\nIs there a way to pinpoint why a fertilized egg will start to implant, but then fails? I have done progesterone tests and even supported the luteal phase with progesterone suppositories during IVF... when I was doing IVF, my lining was always 9-12mm before they implanted the FET (all 3 of which were good quality, but I didn\u2019t do embryo genetic testing on them). While I haven\u2019t had my lining checked again after we stopped IVF 4 months ago, I know when they measured my lining during IUI, it was never too thin. I am slightly anemic, but all 3 RE\u2019s don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason why I haven\u2019t gotten pregnant. \n\nCan anyone advise why I never have a sticky baby? Is there a test or anything out there I\u2019m not aware of that could pin point why it starts to implant but then fails between 11-14dpo?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15461, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Implantation failure during luteal phase", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/e5prtl/implantation_failure_during_luteal_phase/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KnopeProtocol", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16tvsf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575419645, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/e5qrg4/im_proud_to_be_here/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5qrg4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2839f5b6-18df-11e9-8133-0eec4405e856", "link_flair_text": "Introduction", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 28, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/e5qrg4/im_proud_to_be_here/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1575419647, "score": 1, "selftext": "Everything was normal, until it wasn\u2019t.

What he failed to tell me, or even test for, was that I had PCOS. Over a decade and a 10cm cyst removed from my ovary later, and I finally got my official diagnosis. \n\nI always told myself that I didn\u2019t want to be pregnant. That it wasn\u2019t something i desired. Even before the diagnosis, I knew something wasn\u2019t right with my hormones (excess facial hair) and cycles, so I assumed I\u2019d never be able to be pregnant. And it was easier for me to think, \u201cwell, I didn\u2019t want that anyway\u201d than it was to admit that maybe I couldn\u2019t do it. I married a woman, so there was never a chance of conception without medical intervention anyway. I continued to put all thoughts of pregnancy out of my mind. Instead I filled my mind with thoughts like \u201cmy body can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not for me.\u201d\n\nFinally, at age 36 and with a good therapist, I finally admitted to myself that I do want it. And maybe my body can do it.

We did two rounds of retrieval: first round we got 5 eggs, 3 mature, 2 fertilized, both made it to blast. Second round we got 7 eggs, 6 mature, 2 fertilized, 1 made it to blast. We did an aggressive protocol with max stims and ICSI for both rounds and came out with 3 frozen embryos in the end. We transfered our best embryo that year and had success. We just transfered our last two- one failed to implant and the other stopped developing sometime before our first ultrasound.\n\nI'm lying awake and have to get up in 2 hours for a D&amp;C. The only thing keeping me from going to a dark place is focusing on a plan for what to do next. Egg retrieval was very hard on me emotionally, especially at the end getting the phone calls from the lab with updates. I'm 33 now and have no idea the state of my eggs, but I don't want to waste more time on them. I can't bear another retrieval just to get a couple crappy eggs that might not even make it.\n\nI have become almost immediately obsessed with embryo adoption or using donor eggs. It kind of shocked me how fast my mind made that switch. It feels like it should be a deeper decision, and I wonder if my grief over losing our last two is making me overlook feelings that need more consideration.\n\nMy question is for anyone who used/is using donor gametes. Did you mourn the loss of the genetic link to your potential children? Did you take steps to make sure you had thought through any possible ramifications and make sure you had come to terms with your decision? Are there resources you'd recommend that helped you make this decision?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15486, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Moving on from my eggs- low AMH, poor responder to stims", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/e5wlio/moving_on_from_my_eggs_low_amh_poor_responder_to/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575451964, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/e5wswb/carrier_or_surrogacy_discussion_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5wswb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/e5wswb/carrier_or_surrogacy_discussion_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1575451965, "score": 1, "selftext": "This thread is a dedicated space for those that are pursuing gestational carrier or surrogacy as a solution to infertility.

He is a highly recommended (one of the best) endo surgeon and has obviously deemed the risk of leaving my endometrioma there as opposed to excising it a greater risk.

A previous ultrasound before this stated I had PCO however. \n\nKnowing this, my surgeon told me he assumed my AMH would be quite high and ordered a test for me - I assume as a measure to know a baseline of where I\u2019m at pre surgery. He is also an IVF specialist. However my AMH came back at 1.8, around the 10th percentile for my age. This was extremely upsetting for me. However he told me that this is simply only one measure for fertility and with my AFC high, it should not be something I\u2019m stressed about. He has ordered a retest of my AMH with the same lab around 3 months after my surgery.  I\u2019m assuming it will definitely be lower, due to the surgery. He has stated if it is still on the lower side we will talk about freezing eggs. \n\nThis has sent me into a panic. I\u2019m on vitamin D supplements and will also start melatonin in case either of these are falsely (?) causing a lower result for my AMH. Overall, I\u2019m thinking I will definitely need to freeze my eggs, my AMH is so low for my age. I am confused as to why my AFC is high, when I know the two should be correlated with one another. \nDoes anyone know what this means? Could someone like me with these levels and endo even hope for a good outcome with frozen eggs? Would I even get a good amount if AMH and AFC are so different?\n\nThis is all so heavy as I am so young and none of my friends can relate unfortunately. I\u2019m scrolling infertility support groups constantly and I just have such anxiety about never being able to have babies. \n\nAny advice would be so appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15510, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Young w/endo - should I freeze my eggs?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/e6cjzr/young_wendo_should_i_freeze_my_eggs/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "afd37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qleqq8w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575535005, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/e6efv8/hi_guys_can_anyone_tell_me_why_in_a_natural_iui/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e6efv8", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/e6efv8/hi_guys_can_anyone_tell_me_why_in_a_natural_iui/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1575535006, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 15513, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi guys can anyone tell me why in a natural iui cycle where you naturally surge they also give you a trigger shot?
