I am at a complete loss. I'm 25yrs old, single woman and I'm facing more and more issues with being  able to have kids. I don't date so its not like I've a SO that is by my side dealing with this kind of thing. The newest issue that coming up is that I may have progressed from PCOS to Endo, my periods have gone from every other month (so getting about 6 a year sometimes closer to 12) to now If I'm lucky I'll get 4 a year. Its about every 3 months before I have even a basic period that doesn't even last a normal cycle. (its maybe a day or two long). The cramping and pains are getting worse down below as well which was the original symptom that brought me to the ER which I found out about the PCOS. I already have an issue with swelling down below and I can't get it checked until the 4th. I've an idea what it is because I'm not having um discharge issues so theirs an idea what it is.   \n\n\nThe reason I am posting on here is because I need help or support. I've no one in my family that can, I live at home and every time I tried to have my dads support it has backfired. He wants grandkids but he gives me hell when I dare talk about seeing a specialist. I haven't been able to see a GYN cause my normal one moved offices across state lines, (I don't drive currently, no car. and I've never driven in that state and the roads are very busy due to traffic and roads are closed off etc) so when I called the new one they will not see any new patients until March. My date of last exam was December of 2017 and I was in a mental hospital during my last appointment that was supposed to take place. So I am quite a few months behind schedule. I'm terrified that I am gonna get the news that I'm unable to have kids without IVF (which we all understand is extremely pricey even for those who may be a little better off than others) and with IVF you need a good support system with, and your SO has to be willing to go through possible losses and such.   \n\n\nI am going to try to see my old doc but its a small chance because again he moved to a new state. so either way I am not sure of things. I'm 25 so many doctors just look at you like your an idiot because again 25 and single, most don't want to deal with someone like me. I am in the process of weight loss surgery which will help in the long run of kids and what not because my body won't be under as much stress due to the weight. But its still a process, because I've no idea what the state of my reproductive system is in. The lack of periods, means I'm not ovulating on a schedule, if I am at all. I'm so damn scared that I'll be told I'm infertile or that my chances of a full term healthy pregnancy is limited to none..I'm just so alone in this, I don't have someone to confide in that can be that support. I'm just scared.

New to the sub and in need of advice!\n\nSome background on me. I\u2019m a 30F, recently married, and a doctor my first year out of medical school. My husband and I were married in May and immediately began trying to conceive. I had been on oral contraceptive pills from age 15 until 4 months prior to my wedding, so I was surprised when my periods became irregular. In October I had a chemical pregnancy and I got fed up in January and went to an REI specialist. \n\nWell, after an extensive workup she diagnosed me with PCOS. I\u2019m completely stunned, as my BMI is 20.8 and I have no hyperandrogenism either clinically or on labs. I meet Rotterdam Criteria based off my irregular cycles and having  80 visible follicles on ultrasound. I do not represent the \u201ctypical\u201d picture of PCOS and that coupled with my use of birth control pills contributed to my being diagnosed relatively later in life.\n\nMy REI offered me either ovulation induction with Femara + IUI (roughly $2k) or we can go straight to IVF (roughly $16k including medications). The cost difference here is huge, but my husband is enthusiastic about IVF due to its relatively high success rate (75% vs 30-40% for ovulation induction with IUI) and the fact that my ovaries will be frozen at age 30 so I\u2019ll have younger eggs for subsequent attempts to conceive. My friend in OBGYN thinks we will be successful with ovulation induction due to my rather atypical presentation of PCOS and the fact that I\u2019m relatively healthy otherwise. But my husband also has a point. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else out there is going through the same thing and what your experiences are? Any opinions on the matter or other considerations I\u2019m not thinking of? I thought as a doctor I\u2019d be better at making this decision but either way feels like a dice roll.  \n\nAlso, I read the sub rules and tried to follow all of them, but apologies if this violates the rules here or offends anyone!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11444, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ovulation induction with IUI, or straight to IVF?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aozfcv/ovulation_induction_with_iui_or_straight_to_ivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "OrneryPanduhh", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "31F / 5MC, 0 Fertility, 0 Sense of Humour...", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_166byo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1549774740, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ap0wb3/tell_me_about_your_most_awkwardfunny_if_encounter/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ap0wb3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ap0wb3/tell_me_about_your_most_awkwardfunny_if_encounter/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1549774741, "score": 1, "selftext": "I thought this one might be fun for us, since all of this is so stressful and heavy, to just take a few minutes and laugh about this shit show, so tell me about your most awkward or funny IF encounter. \n\nI'll go first!\n\nJust got told that we need to start completely from scratch on all data for new referrals for RE, so TheOtherPanduhh and I ventured out to re-stock on OPKs, a pretty new calendar, some silly tracking stickers (because we're too awkward to talk to each other LOL), etc. We started at Target (because I'm a glutton for punishment), and he was a trooper through the whole trip and we actually had some laughs and fun with it - until we got to check out.

I\u2019ve had overwhelming support over the past few days and I couldn\u2019t have found a better sub for myself under the circumstances. \n\nAs mentioned a few days ago, my best friend popped up pregnant after deceitfully getting her boyfriend to make her pregnant. I\u2019m still reeling from this, to be honest.\n\nThen yesterday, I got 15 missed calls from my cousin. Keep in mind - I have little contact with this girl because she\u2019s bad news. She\u2019s my age and I personally decided to cut contact because she was always in trouble with the police and law enforcements. She was also always sleeping around with random men and a crazy alcoholic. My own family have little to do with her. \n\nI didn\u2019t answer any of the calls or return them. I blocked her number because she was annoying me, actually. At this stage I didn\u2019t realise what was going on.\n\nThen 2 hours later, she posts on Facebook a picture of 6 positive pregnancy tests. Very, very faint lines on the tests so she must only just be pregnant but nonetheless, positive tests.\n\nAnd you know what\u2019s fucking unfair??\nShe\u2019s been with her boyfriend since November of 2018. They barely even know each other. They live together in a state funded, 1 bedroomed apartment and she has never worked a day in her life. Even more worryingly, a few weeks ago she lied about having a miscarriage. I 100% knew she had lied about it because nobody ever saw photos of a positive pregnancy test and there was no evidence that she was ever in hospital. Surely, if she had been pregnant she would\u2019ve taken photos of the positive test the same way as she has done the positive tests she slapped all over Facebook last night? It makes my brain want to pop. She lied about losing a baby yet is somehow blessed with a baby one month later. There is no such thing as karma in this world, and I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any such thing as God either. \nThe infuriating thing is, she was posting about how blessed she is and how it was \u2018the rainbow at the end of the storm\u2019 for her. She was never pregnant when she claimed she miscarried. Never. Her comments make an absolute mockery out of people like us. \n\nTomorrow (Monday) she is due to appear in court because she is being sentenced for robbery and physically assaulting someone. Again, another disgraceful factor and this woman has been blessed with a pregnancy. She won\u2019t be given a jail sentence because we\u2019re in the UK and the laws are pretty slack, however she definitely should be because she is always being arrested for something. She seems to have more (legal) lives than a cat. \n\nLast night, when I saw this news, I was pretty drunk. I never; ever drink and had decided to let loose for one night. I was actually so drunk I could barely walk. I very nearly commented on the post and told her she was lucky, and she\u2019d never realise how lucky she is because she didn\u2019t care. I wanted to pour my heart out on this post and then block her. Well, thank god i stopped myself and just went to bed because I\u2019d be regretful this morning.\n\nI\u2019ve come to realise this morning, my cousin is NOT luckier than me in most ways. The only thing she has that I\u2019d want is her now pregnancy. She has an unstable, 3 month old relationship with a guy who sells drugs (and is also due to be sentenced in court for that) she lives in a tiny apartment that is funded by the government so she has no pride as she owns nothing of her own, she\u2019s incredibly mentally unstable and has a criminal record as long as my leg. No, I\u2019m not jealous of her, she isn\u2019t \u2018lucky\u2019 \nThat mindset has helped me slightly today. \n\nHope you all have a fantastic Sunday x\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11442, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "More unfair feelings, another bad weekend!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ap2w64/more_unfair_feelings_another_bad_weekend/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "poeticpotty", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2shk6r1o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1549803959, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ap3q54/why_dont_they_sell_girl_scout_cookies_outside_re/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ap3q54", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ap3q54/why_dont_they_sell_girl_scout_cookies_outside_re/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1549803959, "score": 1, "selftext": "Just saying, they'd sell out in like 10 minutes.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11441, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why don't they sell girl scout cookies outside RE clinics?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ap3q54/why_dont_they_sell_girl_scout_cookies_outside_re/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "toronto-yyz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_36sw6yjc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1549813478, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ap50dx/free_meds_toronto_downtown/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ap50dx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ap50dx/free_meds_toronto_downtown/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1549813480, "score": 1, "selftext": " I have the following medications available to donate: \n\n\\- 75 IU Menopur (1x vial) \u2013 expires Feb 2020\n\n\\- Gonal F 900 IU pen \u2013 I used 125 IU from this pen so there is 775 IU + overfill left \u2013 expires June 2020 but it has not been refrigerated since it was purchased on Jan 25 2019.

My husband (29M) and I (29F) have a followup appointment with our RE this Wednesday following our fourth PGS normal FET fail. I've gotten so much great information from the wonderful people on this thread just by lurking. I thought it was time for me to introduce myself and tell my story and ask for any advice/things that we should be asking our RE at our appointment. I'll be as brief as possible but it's been a long journey!\n\nNovember 2015: started \"trying\". \n\nNovember 2016: met with RE, did baseline tests including HSG, SHG, semen analysis. Everything came back \"normal\" with a hint of PCOS for me. I am lean but have somewhat long cycles and have always struggled with moderate acne. AFC and AMH high-ish. Did 2 rounds of letrozole... fail.\n\nFebruary 2017:  continue the letrozole as my body seemed to respond well to it. Added on IUI. Did this 5 times... fail. Never a hint of a positive.\n\nDecember 2017: Move on to IVF. Stims and retrieval went fine. 40 eggs, 36 mature, 27 fertilized, but only 9 made it to day 5 to be PGS tested. Of the 9, we had 6 normal.\n\nFebruary 2018: FET 1: this was my first and only positive beta, which was low and ended in a CP\n\nMay 2018: FET 2: Fail\n\nJuly 2018: ERA testing. window came back as pre-receptive by 12 hours. \n\nNovember 2018: after spending 3 months trying to get my body to cooperate (this ordeal could be a whole separate post), FET 3: Fail.\n\nJanuary 2019: decided to try a \"natural\" FET cycle as opposed to the other 3 which were HRT (estrogen patches and pills). So this time we did the letrozole. Everything went well... until it didn't. Another fail.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading. I am rather lost at this point as far as the next steps to take. My RE is very science-minded and doesn't like to do things that haven't been proven by literature. I appreciate this about her, but I feel like at this point we need to take a step back and realize that we are not a \"textbook\" case and perhaps we need to think outside the box. I am hesitant to suggest anything as I am afraid she will shut it down as being unscientific. So, I am looking for any advice on things we should be considering at this point.

My journey is continuing and I\u2019m still very new to all the information\n\nThis is an update from my last post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/9i1xkn/high_fsh_and_low_estrogen_28year_old_female/?st=JS2FIIC0&amp;sh=90857b2b\n\nSince my last post, I saw a fertility doctor. The doctor looked over my bloodwork. To recap, I am a 28F and my FSH was 13.4 miu/ml. The doctor decided the next route was to get my AMH tested. \n\nI won\u2019t go into all the annoying details, but insurance issues delayed this process. I ended up having my obgyn write the script for me because otherwise insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the test. My AMH came back very low at .57 ng/L and my FSH is still high at 12.4 miu/ml. During a previous sonogram, I had what looked like a collection of cysts on my ovary. She was pretty convinced I had PCOS, however, my low AMH rules that out. \n\nSince my last post, I have had unwanted hair growth, acne outbreaks on my back (never happened to me in my life), a random missed period and a lot of pain/blood clots when my period finally came. \n\nMy obgyn thinks I may potentially have endometriosis (runs in the family), but wants me to go back to the fertility specialist before we consider treatment for that.\n\nAs I am sure many of you probably know, fertility doctors are so expensive. My doctor was pushing me trying to see if I\u2019m a candidate for egg freezing.\n\nI am sorry if any of this seems ignorant or uninformed.

I\u2019ve STC (struggled to conceive) since 2016. My life for the past 5 years has been incredibly hard. I apologize for the long post, but the timeline is important. Since 2014, the following has happened to me:\n\n2014: Told parents my husband and I were going to TTC\n\n2014: Month after TTC, Mom diagnosed with stage 2 cancer. Did 1 year of chemo + surgery and prognosis was good. \n\n2014: 3 months after mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis, had to move 2000 miles across country while mom was in treatment \n\n2015: Dad died unexpectedly less than a month after my 36 birthday. Later discovered dad metastatic stage 4 cancer that he hid from me. So I never got the chance to see him since I moved to a different state. Also I did not know if my mom knew he had cancer. When his death certificate came in, I had to explain his cause of death and she cried, so I assumed she didn\u2019t know. \n\n2016: I tried to move forward with life and began TTC in late summer. However my clockwork periods became highly irregular. My doctor didn\u2019t think anything was wrong, since previous fertility testing was amazing given I was over 35.  Doctor chalked it up to stress. \n\n2017: Irregular periods getting worse so referred to RE. After doing repeat labs, I was diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure (POF). I was absolutely devastated and shocked as there was no family history or cause if this condition. \n\n2017: Somehow after diagnosis, I was ovulating. RE agreed to do an medicated IUI. That did not work and RE we can try again. I did not respond to the injectables meds. During my follicle check, the RE very coldly and un-compassionately said \u201cYou\u2019ll only have a 5% chance of ever having a baby.\u201d She just walked out of the exam room and the nurse gave me a nasty smirk. I was overwhelmed with sorrow and passed out in the exam room, half baked and spread eagle for God knows how long. \n\n2017: Husband and I moved back to our home state, and my mom agreed we could stay with her until we had money to buy s house. \n\n2017: We tried an IUI, which was unsuccessful. RE suggested IVF, and I had 3 follicles. Went through the whole IVF process and woke up from egg retrieval only to discover I had no eggs in my follicles. I was absolutely devastated. \n\n2018: We decided to take time off from TTC, enjoy life and try another IVF cycle in summer. \n\n2018: My mom was having some aches and pains that was not resolving. Doctor confirmed her cancer care back. We accompanied her to her oncology visit. Her oncologist told my husband and I that they notified my mom after my dad died in 2015 that her cancer cane back. She told the doctor she didn\u2019t care what happened to her and did not get treatment. The oncologist also told us my mom knew my dad had cancer. So my mom lied to me about her and my dad\u2019s cancer diagnosis!\n\n2018: My job was unsympathetic to my situation with having to care for my mom (I\u2019m an only child). So I had to resign. I now have to care for my mom. \n\n2018: I still would like to have a biological child and begin priming for another IVF cycle at a clinic that deals with DOR/POF, high FSH, etc. \n\n2019: Again no response to stim meds and cycle is in limbo. Also I only have 1 tiny follicle so chances of cycle working are slim. \n\nI apologize for the length of this post. But how could God possibly love me if all this happened to me?  Im conceived God either doesn\u2019t exist or if He does, he hates me. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11490, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "God hates me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aq2bux/god_hates_me/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1550048865, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aq4p2v/welcome_wednesdays_thread/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "aq4p2v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 143, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/aq4p2v/welcome_wednesdays_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1550048865, "score": 1, "selftext": "Are you new to r/infertility?

We had 5 total embryos, so one wasn't high enough quality to freeze. Right before transfer they said they had chosen the best embryo, and yesterday I forgot to ask, so today when they called I asked about grading. I was told that of the three that were frozen, two are \"expanded AA\", and the third is 4AB. Then I asked the grading of the one they transferred and they said it was \"expanded AB.\" I've done some research and I believe when they say \"expanded\" they mean a 4, so it sounds like we have two 4AA and one 4AB frozen, and that they transferred a 4AB yesterday? Does this sound right? It was the morning of day 5, and I know they let the embryos grow until the evening, so maybe they increased in quality, but I'm really not sure how it works.

If it's not allowed I'll take it down but I wanted all the help I could get. I'm currently 25 years old,  with no intention of having children at the moment. From age 11 I've always had irregular heavy periods. I was put on birth control from around age 20 to maybe 22. ( it may be have been a little less than that). I got off birth control around a year ago, and ever since then my periods have been shorter (3 days with only one heavy day, as opposed to 5/6 days from when I was younger than 20).  I was on birth control when I was 21 and I had routine lab tests including FSH/LH/Testosterone (free and total). My mom said the doctor said everything was fine and I believed her because why wouldn't I. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, because my periods have been odd in the past year, and the OB didn't find anything wrong in the exam, I want to get my hormone levels tested again.

First of all I would like to wish you all a lot of courage and good luck wherever you are on your journey! I hope your wish of becoming a parent may come true in whichever way is right for you and your familie. I often read posts here and I am in awe of how strong you all are (even though it\u2019s completely okay if you\u2019re not).\n\nAnyway\u2026 I just need a bit of a rant after what happened at the hospital today. Sorry if it turns out long and unstructured, just need to get this off my chest. I hope that\u2019s okay. Please delete if it's not!\n\nI \\[25f\\] have Turner syndrome (I only have one X chromosome instead of 2) and as a result, 8 years ago my doctors, my parents and I all decided it would be best to remove my uterus since I was bleeding uncontrollably and I was on the verge of anemia. Because of the syndrome, my uterus was not viable anyway (except for bleeding apparently, ugh) and I didn't have ovaries so, a hysterectomy was definitely the right choice for me. This however does not mean the infertility isn\u2019t still on my mind almost every day. Even after 8 years, I can barely remember the surgery and the moments after waking up without breaking down in tears\u2026 Knowing that I will never be pregnant, never have a baby of my own, \u2026 is just heart-breaking.\n\nA few days ago I had a check-up with my cardiologist (Turner\u2019s can also affect your heart, fantastic, isn't it?) and he decided I needed a CT scan with contrast fluid \u2018cause he couldn\u2019t see my aorta very well on the ultrasound. So, this morning I went in. All is good, all is well, until the nurse comes to get me to put in the IV. She grabs her check list and starts asking me all the questions she needs to ask.\n\n* Are you pregnant?\n* Could you be?\n* Are you current trying for IVF?\n* Are you currently breastfeeding?\n\nShe was a very sweet and young nurse. I understand completely that they have to ask/check. I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable by mentioning the hysterectomy or anything\u2026 so I just answered the questions and let it go. Even though I should have seen it coming (I\u2019ve had scans many times before) it took me by surprise, and I\u2019ve been feeling sad/down ever since. I wish they could just put that on my file so they wouldn\u2019t have to ask every time\u2026\n\nThanks for reading\u2026 Have a nice day!\u00a0\n\nTL;DR: Went to the hospital today for a scan, got asked a bunch of pregnancy related questions, got upset, needed to vent.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11508, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My visit to the hospital today sucked [VENTING]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aqjq67/my_visit_to_the_hospital_today_sucked_venting/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "LemonadeEclipse", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5c9ocum", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1550155903, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aqkiwa/still_bleeding_on_day_10/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "aqkiwa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/aqkiwa/still_bleeding_on_day_10/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1550155903, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm going in for my day 10 ultrasound today to prep for our second IUI round.

I'm posting this with permission from the Mods. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name is Anna Almendrala, and I was the host of HuffPost's infertility podcast IVFML.\n\nI'm now working to help another podcast, called Bodies, find women who might be willing to share their ongoing infertility story with them. If you haven't heard this amazing podcast, know that the host goes DEEP and that subjects really go there when it comes to sharing the darkest, most hidden aspects of really difficult medical issues with listeners.\n\nThe producers aren't necessarily looking for someone who has already found a solution/answer to their issues.

Maybe it's crap. But maybe some of you will enjoy it. Here it goes! \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe wall of the examining room is a shade of emerald green. A bold choice, I think, for a doctor\u2019s office. It complements the backsplash of the sink area across the room which is made up of small iridescent tiles in shades of blue, turquoise, and aquamarine. \n\nThe wall perpendicular to the emerald wall is one long window from floor to ceiling. A strange feature for a room where dozens of women a day get undressed from the waist down and probed with an ultrasound wand. But, they\u2019ve made sure to cover it with a privacy blind that obscures the view into the room, while still letting in some natural light. In my prone position on the examining table, I can still make out, through the blind, the faint lines of clouds moving across the sky. \n\n\"Is this my story?\" I ask myself.  \n\nEvery child has a story of when and how they were conceived. My mother was just 21 when I was born, and if you do the math I was conceived on or around my parents\u2019 wedding day. I imagine the moment I was conceived as being one of tenderness and love... not one of clinical precision and discomfort, laying alone in a doctor\u2019s office, staring at the spot where two walls meet. \n\nMoments earlier, as I arrived in the room, before I was instructed to \"undress from the waist down,\u201d the doctor presented me with a clipboard, and on that clipboard was a piece of paper with a vial taped to it. \n\n8 million. That\u2019s the number of sperm collected from my husband, thawed and washed, in that little vial. If the sperm were a city, it would be the population of London. \n\n\u201cCheck to make sure the name of your husband is correct,\u201d the doctor tells me. \n\nI muster a short gasp \u201cThat\u2019s not my husband\u2019s name!\u201d\n\nThe doctor looks at me, raising one eyebrow, and gives me a sly smile. \n\n\u201cI guess you\u2019ve heard that one before,\u201d I say sheepishly.\n\nShe smiles \u201cOnly about once a day.\u201d\n\nI confirm that is indeed my husband\u2019s name. I lay back. Speculum in, speculum out. The catheter deploys 8 million DNA torpedoes all focused on a single target \u2013 one they have up until now completely missed - one I've been watching grow on the ultrasound screen for 14 days. \n\nThe nurse directs me to put my feet on the table with my knees in the air, sets a timer for 5 minutes, and leaves the room. \n\n\"Maybe my husband\u2019s sperm aren\u2019t the brightest in the world,\" I think. Or maybe my reproductive system is so confusing they get lost. Or maybe my immune system is too strong and it kills them all. Maybe my egg and the sperm meet just fine, but my egg is all like \u201cI have a headache,\u201d and the sperm are all like \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve had a long day. Why don\u2019t we do this tomorrow?\u201d and they turn on Netflix instead\u2026 with NO chill. \n\nThese are the things I think about as I watch the clouds overhead. It\u2019s amazing how long 5 minutes feels when you\u2019re laying on your back, waiting. \n\nAt the checkout desk, the receptionist is cheery. I pay my $20 copay, and set up my next appointment for two weeks\u2019 time. She offers me a heart-shaped chocolate. \n\n\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day!\u201d she says. \n\nI smile back. \u201cYou know\u2026 it\u2019s my ten-year wedding anniversary today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got married on Valentine\u2019s Day? How romantic!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cIt makes it doubly bad if I forget my anniversary.\u201d\n\nShe laughs. \u201cWell, you know\u2026 maybe it\u2019s lucky. I don\u2019t know if you believe in signs, but\u2026 Maybe it's a good sign.\u201d\n\nI nod at her, begrudgingly. I know she's trying to be nice but I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her I don\u2019t believe in signs. \n\nOutside, the air is cool, but warm for February. A man in a business suit is carrying a bouquet of roses. I take a moment and look up at the facades of the buildings, and overhead, the same cloud-streaked sky I had seen while laying on my back in the examining room. \n\nDo I dare let myself hope? Do I dare allow myself a moment to dream, and imagine, and fantasize about things that might be? How easy it would be to allow myself to curl up in it, all warm and cozy, like a thick duvet on a cold winter morning. Hope is deliciously tempting\u2026\n\nAnd dangerous, too. Hope is a beautiful yet vulnerable thing. It\u2019s fragile and precarious. It doesn\u2019t pay attention to rules or rationality or science. It knows what the heart wants and feeds and nourishes it with illusion. It allows you to invest in ideas which have not, and may not, ever be born. \n\nBut can\u2019t I just let myself? Just for a moment? Can\u2019t I just let myself feel the anticipation and surety that hope brings? Can I just for one moment imagine the call, two weeks from now, the voice at the other end saying that word I\u2019ve been longing to here: \u201cCongratulations!\u201d \n\nI put in my earbuds and press shuffle on my music library and the song that comes up makes my heart sink as Morrisey\u2019s voice croons: \u201cYou just haven\u2019t earned it yet, baby.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s a sign.

Yesterday, I got confirmation from my GYN that pregnancy is \u00ab very unlikely or impossible \u00bb for us without help. It was a crushing moment. And I was alone. \n\nI'm 37 years old, husband is 34. We have been together 7 years. We live in very northern Canada. We have been TTC for 13 months/14 cycles, without any success.\n\nEverything on my side is ok, blood tests were normal (slightly elevated prolactine but normal for my age), ovarian echo was normal, physical exam too. I'm at a healthy weight. I'm active, do not drink alcohol (I don't like the taste!) and overall in good shape/health. \n\nHusband had a SA. It's not good. Everything, and I mean everything, is either at the very low normal or under. His weight is a factor (he has been working on it lately) and his alcool consumption. That has been a work in progress for months. It's getting better but still not in the healthy range. \n\nI'm also a nationaly ranked athlete. I was planing my retirement in 2018, but not being pregnant makes it harder. I don't know what to do... Keep training and drop out if I get pregnant? Retire and risk regretting it if I'm not pregnant next competition season? I'ts one more heartbrake I have to deal with... And their is a lot of money involved. A training and show season is about 10K. \n\nNo one knows we are TTC (per my request). My family is not the supportive kind (and my mother still thinks I'm too young... at 37 ... and doesn't believe in medical treatment for infertility). I feel lonely and isolated but still cannot bring myself to talk about it. I'm a very very private person, and this feels like a failure on my part. \n\nIf anyone is interested in chatting, I could use a buddy.

We spent out 20's building our lives and careers, getting out of debt, and basically learning to adult.  Early 30s we feel we got adulting under control, buy a home, grow our retirement nest egg, and are enjoying the comforts our hardwork and planning have provided us.  \n\nI've wanted kids for a while, but my husbands on the fence, but at 36 he gets it, he's ready.  We start trying January '18.  Im down 50lbs, but looking to lose more, so Im not dissapointed when eavh month I get my period.  I view it as a chance to keep getting healthier.\n\nFast forward 1 year, I'm concerned we are not pregnant, and head to a fertility doctor.  Hormones are good, ovarian reserves good, normal periods, husbands sperm is good.\n\nNext step Sono HSG....i was a bit freaked out because I was not sure if it would hurt.  Took pain meds and a Xanax to chill before the procedure.  Easy foley insert, but some gnarly cramping with the vaginal probe movements.  Uterus is normal....but....\n\nBoth tubes are blocked.  What are the fucking chances?       Happy Valentine's day....no kids without science and medical intervention for you!  I felt so sad and alone, laying there covered with only a paper sheet.  The doc told me to take my time and asked me how I was.  I told her I was processing....on one hand shocked and sad, but on the other glad to know why I couldnt get pregnant, because at least with knowledge we could hopefully move forward.\n\nSo i have a few questions.  Should i get a second opinion on my tubes?  Could the SonoHSG be wrong?  Should i get the dye HSG?  Anyone have a false blocked tube diagnosis?  \n\nGuilt.  How do you work through the guilt of knowing you are the problem, that you are the reason your spouse doesnt have kids? \n\nI cry, and my husbands holds me, reassures me, but I see the hurt on his face...he is a fixer, and he can't fix this deep pain lodged in me.  He hurts because I hurt. And my anxiety is overwhelming me....the what ifs keep creeping in...what if we never get pregnant, what if he resents the life we have built if there are no children to fill it?  \n\nI'm grieving today, hard.  I have very litte control over this situation, and that is really hard for me.  I can't fix this by myself....i cant fix my tubes. It looks like IVF is my only option if this diagnosis stands.  I hate having a lack of options.  So I'm grieving, and Im allowing it.  I get to cry, mourn my lack of choices, and come to terms with what this all means.  \n\nMy follow up to discuss next steps us Feb. 27th.  \n\nAnyway thank you for reading.

I told a different nurse (my nurse was out) what I had been told to me on Monday and she said that was incorrect (which is what I thought) and that my nurse shouldn't have told me that. \n\n5) Had I know that we only had 7 to start with, my husband and I would have seriously reconsidered moving forward this cycle because I have had higher antral follicle counts in the past (15, 12). \n\n6) I specifically picked this doctor (despite her stats being lower than another clinic) because she made it seem that I would receive a lot of personal attention and care. This was important to me because IVF is such a stressful experience. Since this has not been the case, I am wondering if I should have the clinic with the higher stats (and lower cost retrieval) take over from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this sound like a crazy idea?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 11521, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Changing Clinics Mid-IVF Cycle???", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aqy7d4/changing_clinics_midivf_cycle/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"author": "luisluisa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_38b4n1j8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1550249687, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/aqyki9/infertility_interview/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "aqyki9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/aqyki9/infertility_interview/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1550249688, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone! I am looking for someone who is willing to be interviewed about experiencing Infertility. This is for a school research project. Before anything else, I just want to say that this interview will not only benefit me, but it will also benefit so many other people out there. It is about spreading awareness for yourself and for the others. I choose this topic for my project because of the fact that many of us treat infertility as an uncomfortable subject. Of course, it is a sensitive matter and it is a private issue, but because it affects a lot of people, I felt like I needed to inform people about it. As I said, it is a private matter, so I would understand (if ever you agree to this interview) if you simply would like to skip a question. Guys, please give this a lot of thought. It would mean a lot.
