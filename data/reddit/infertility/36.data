Maybe it's because we didn't wait. As soon as we got married, we started TTC. Maybe that's our problem. But it's bad. It's like we are just roommates who have to have sex. Not even like, oh fun sex, just like, we have to. I can't even say we are friends because if a friend called and said \"oh hey I'm so stressed about work\" I would talk to them about it and try to hep. When my husband says the same thing, I have to force myself to not tell him to suck it up. I resent him so much. Not because of his MFI, but because his lack of ownership and support. Everytime I come up with a plan, IUI, IVF, fosterr care, adoption, he shoots them all down. Because \"it'll happen.\" He's so against trying everything, but he also doesn't want to adopt the childless life. So I can't seek treatment, but I also am not allowed to move on with my life. So it's limbo and I resent him for putting me here with no way out. There is no support when I cry about being depressed about all this beyond the \"have hope, it'll happen.\" I struggling compartmentalizing so this IF is just right there in front of me and I can't seem to enjoy anything in life. Not being with friends, not going out with him, not traveling, nothing. And I know I am depressed. I know. and I am seeing a therapist for that but anytime I go in to see here I end up venting about him the entire time instead of recovering. I just have gotten to the point where everything he does makes me angry. Everything is just another area where I can't depend on him. I've talked to him so many times. I have told him over and over that I am unhappy. I even told him I was thinking about divorce because he isn't giving me the support I need and expect. but he just tells me I am being crazy and emotional. He doesn't believe me. Even my therapist has told him when I brought him in. She said he was gonna end up losing me if he didn't listen. But still. Nothing.\n\nWhat do you all do?

We were supposed to get an IUI, but my body didn't respond to the Letrozole. My follicles basically stopped growing and they aren't sure why. The doctor said it happens to 15% of women. After receiving the news and calming down, I called to get my husband's SA results. His count went from 9 million to 36 million and had 72% motility (thanks to Clomid). I also asked the nurse a few questions about our next steps. They would like us to do another IUI cycle with Letrozole and injectables. I'm extremely hesitant because my body didn't respond to that medication in the first place. We also discussed egg quality for a bit and it is a possibility that my eggs are immature or shit quality. It's also a possibility that this could have been a shit cycle and has no bearing on my fertility. Either way, my husband and I decided to take a break from the treatments for awhile and try TI for a few months. If it doesn't work, I think we might request moving straight to IVF. We can't afford to take a week off of work with each IUI cycle. Plus it might answer more of our questions. I'm also going to delete Reddit for awhile in hopes that I will stop obsessing over all of this. Right now, my faith is lost and I feel awful that we wasted a trip. The possibility of not going through with the IUI never crossed my mind. I knew that it might not work, but not being able to get the procedure crushed me. I want a baby so fucking bad, but I might have to accept that it might not ever be in the cards for my husband and me. So before I leave, I need some advice, words of encouragement, or even successes with those of you who have been in a similar situation. I need some type of hope to grasp onto so I can get back to my positive self and move on with our future. And I'd also like to thank all of you for your kind words and advice while going through all of this. Infertility is such a mind fuck and I needed rational words of encouragement and a place to vent my frustrations without judgement.

My husband just got diagnosed with Teratozoospermia (1% normal). He got tested after we tried for 13 months with only an 8 week miscarriage to show for it.

How did we get pregnant at all when the fertility clinic recommended ICSI immediately and said chances of natural conception were slim? Was the miscarriage caused by the defective sperm? What do we do now?\n\nI wanted to try the least invasive thing possible first, which led me to looking at \"natural\" IVF (where they just take the one naturally maturing egg), or maybe natural + in vitro maturation (\"IVM\") to hopefully get some \"spare\" embryos. Has anyone done IVM? How many eggs do you get? Is it comparable to IVF \"light\", with the low levels of hormones? I like the idea of single embryo transfer, but obviously that adds to the cost and reduces the odds of conception each transfer. \n\nBecause pressures of time and money do exist, we are also considering the shotgun approach of full IVF+multiple transfer. \n\nI don't know... just looking for a bit of advice or feedback I guess.

I know this has been posted about before, but wanted to get a better idea how many people have had a non-horrific experience with misoprostol.  I don't like the idea of the risks involved with surgery in terms of scarring and anesthesia, but it seems like a lot of people ended up having to do a D+C after misoprostol anyway because it didn't end up getting rid of everything (along with the horrible cramping etc).  Am I just hearing from the people with bad experiences, or is this kind of normal?  We and our RE don't feel that we need the D+C to learn more about the cause of the mc, I'm 37 and don't have a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (seems like our troubles are more MF related) so most likely this was a genetically abnormal embryo.

My story is devastating. I got ovarian cancer at 17, stage 4 endometriosis at 20, and a full hysterectomy by the time I was 22. I'm nearly 25 now, take HRT, am cancer-free, and admittedly, am a lurker/poster on the r/childfree subreddit. \n\nNow, let me explain, since these boards are basically opposites and r/childfree can be a little toxic at times. I figured I'd throw in a disclaimer here, especially if my history is checked. I never wanted children before the cancer and all the bullshit and plus, I was still a teenager. I lurk there now because it makes me feel better, honestly, and i can chime in for women wanting their tubes tied, hysterectomy, etc... Before I got my hysterectomy, however, I was desperate and was for years to get pregnant and have a baby. I had half the egg supply and endo. My odds were not good. I lurked on r/infertility much longer... trust me. Getting cancer changed everything for me and called into question the bigger picture of things starting at 17, so my mindset shifted quickly. \n\nI had one ovary after the cancer took the other, and by the time I found out I had endometriosis, I knew NOW was my only chance to really ever have a child of my own via pregnancy. So my partner and I at the time tried for a year straight, including hormones and IUI to give it our best shot. I was in shambles every month and devastated when the stress and failure to conceive ultimately tore that relationship apart. I never had any signs of pregnancy whatsoever.\n\nI got a hysterectomy a year after the IUI because my periods were obviously agony, i got some serious grief counseling for the loss of my ability to conceive, moved away, and started a new life. I am with a wonderful man now and have been for almost 2 years. Occasionally, my inability to conceive comes up, but for the most part, we are grateful for consequence free sex. I have moments of sadness of course, as well as he, but for the most part we have accepted it and moved on.\n\nHere's the problem. My brother told me last night he and his fiance are pregnant. We are completely blindsided and while this was somewhat expected, it was not thought to be anytime soon. He is my only sibling and this will be the first grandchild, as none of my other cousins have kids. Of course I'm thrilled to be an aunt and expressed this explicitly when we spoke on the phone. But wow when I woke up this morning? I lost it... I am still on the verge of another breakdown. To make it worse? It was their first try. \n\nEverything came flooding back. It feels like yesterday I was peeing on sticks and sobbing on the linoleum, wondering what the hell I'd done to deserve this agony. I'm right back in the same boat I was. All emotion, sense of loss, and that aching despair in my chest. I know I'll be okay and I'm thrilled for them. But if anyone understands right now it's the ladies here and I just really need some support. I am a little blindsided by all the emotion and feelings coming up and I am not sure how to handle. Any similar experiences with siblings/sister-in-laws or advice on how to stay sane would be so appreciated.\n\nThank you for those who read this and for being here. \n\nTL;DR: Sister-in-law is pregnant. I can never have my own children OR get pregnant. Need help peeling myself off the floor.\n\n\nEDIT: WOW. Overwhelmed by these responses, all the love and support. I can't thank you all enough. r/IFchildfree is what I have needed and been searching for. Thank you to all who suggested that sub.\u2764 I am touched by the kindness and concern from each and every one of you.

It ends up that that was not the right route for us to go because I thought that my medical issues (namely Type II diabetes) were under control, but ends up they weren't.  In Mexico they kinda farm you through the process so my levels weren't being checked and this is most likely the reason that the two IVF cycles were unsuccessful.  This was this past summer.\n\nAfter getting a lecture from my primary physician (who happens to be my uncle) about why the cycles probably didn't work.  I really started to work on getting myself healthy.  I've lost 37 lbs. since January, now exercise 4 to 5 days a week (jogging, Pilates, yoga) and I'm in better shape than I probably have been my whole life.  My Type II is now under control and the new RE that we're seeing here in the U.S. wants to go ahead with the process, feeling I'm physically ready.\n\nNow comes the problem.  How do we pay for this?  The clinic we are going through works with a financing company, but they only approved us for a little less than half of the full cost of treatments and medications.  We have started asking for our family's help, but most of them are not in a position to do much.  I am also the one dealing with all the phone calls to the financing company, different lenders to talk about possibly taking out a home equity loan, etc. etc.  There's phone calls and paperwork at every turn and I'm just trying to figure out our next step.  I usually handle paperwork like this so the task naturally fell to me.\n\nThat being said, we were told by our RE that we have a 30-40% chance of the IVF working.  Should we be going into this much debt knowing that it's far from a sure thing?  That this is probably it and we're putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak.  We'll be paying off what we owe for five years or more.  It'll be worth it if it works, but if it doesn't each payment is just a painful reminder that we failed and are still paying the price for that failure.\n\nI'm just tired and needed to vent to people that understand.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tired and trying to figure everything out", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5pyhes/tired_and_trying_to_figure_everything_out/"}, {"author": "amosp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1485289371, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5pyif6/do_we_allow_ridiculous_questions_here/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5pyif6", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5pyif6/do_we_allow_ridiculous_questions_here/", "retrieved_on": 1489470318, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Look, I've spent way too much time over the past 16 cycles on birth boards so please don't judge me for what I'm about to ask.

I'm joining you this evening from the corner of my couch, as I pop another Motrin and open the bottle of wine I have been drooling over for the past two weeks -- in a vain attempt to cure the cramps that kindly reminded me today that we failed again.\n\nAlmost two years to the day, we started trying and now we're staring down the start of IUI cycle #3 this week with a scheduled reconsult with our RE. \nI'm 27, and was diagnosed last December with PCOS after almost of a year of trying with no success. I've always had normal periods, but suffer horrendous cramps and other fun side effects like severe nausea. After 8 years on birth control (and with none of those fun symptoms), I guess it's no surprise PCOS finally reared its ugly head to screw us over. My husband is 29 and his semen analysis came back ok. After the usual tests and an HSG for good measure confirmed I haven't been ovulating but egg count and quality look good, we were encouraged to give timed intercourse a try with the usual cocktail: Femara, Metformin (the \"devil\" drug as I affectionately call it), and Ovidrel to trigger. We were told by the doctor and pharmacists that we wouldn't be here long. \n\nFive failed medicated timed intercourse cycles and a deployment later, we're now reeling from a surprise pregnancy announcement from my younger sister in law (typical \"we only tried for two months and now we get to bring the first grandchild into the world! blah blah blah) despite her knowing about our struggle. After I got over my meltdown and jealous rage a few months ago, we moved on to IUI. The holidays with the in laws and golden daughter were, as you might imagine, a real blast.\n\nSo far, no dice. Last cycle, after only one ovary decided to barely respond to meds and the sperm sample showed some possible motility issues, we were advised to set up a reconsult, which in my mind, means we're probably going to talk IVF once this next IUI cycle fails. \n\nSome days, I wonder how almost 2 years (1.5 when you factor in deployment) got here so fast. Like many of you, I remember the day I threw my birth control pills away and stupidly thought, \"This year, everything is going to change!\" And boy, has it. With this latest failed cycle, it stings a little more than usual -- it was the last chance for my husband to physically be here for a success before he deploys again in the fall. Like so many of you, I'm tired of this bullshit emotional rollercoaster ride, and while I want off, I am terrified of the prospect of being forced to jump. I'm tired of life revolving around ultrasounds, blood work, catheters, pills, shots, and two week waits. Despite having much to be thankful for, this shitstorm of a journey continues to break us down little by little.\n\nSob story now complete, I wanted to thank you guys for getting me through some of the dark days of waiting, of despair, and even the few moments of fleeting hope. I find myself cheering for you guys daily and I don't know how I would have made it so far without your awesomely bitter humor, soul baring experiences, and sincere encouragement. Some days, you take the words I can't bear to utter out loud right out of my mouth.

My OBGYN asked me to see a RE.\n\n\n**Reproductive Endocrinologist**- suggested to do laparoscopic surgery to remove the fibroids. He also said we may have to have IVF later on if Fallopian tubes get damaged or scarring. He is ready to do the surgery in 2 weeks, hasn't asked for MRI or additional imaging/tests.\nWe went for an second opinion, to a Gyn surgeon.\n\n\n**Gynecologic surgeon** - Thinks its safer in my case to go with abdominal myomectomy, even though he is well known robotic/laparoscopic surgeon, as the one inside cavity needs to be carefully removed and endometrial lining preserved. He thinks surgeon will have full/better control during the procedure to do a clean job and suture it well, so that it doesn't rupture during future pregnancy. He wants to atleast do an MRI before surgery to see exactly whats going on.  He did not suggest IVF or anything yet and is optimistic everything will be fine afterwards, even though recovery time is slightly longer.\n\n\nHas anyone been in similar situation?

Quick summary for those of you who do not remember me (shout out to you guys in Senior Class), and those of you who are new (lots of new names here, sorry to see you all here and fist bump in solidarity):  I'm a 31F with no-known issues, from Ontario, and have been on this ride for 2.5 years.  My husband has low sperm count, and after a varicolectomy which improved his other parameters (morph/motility - both were already normal, now just better), count was only slightly better and kept us in the IVF/ICSI range.   In November we were lucky enough to win the OHIP funded lottery at our clinic (it was waitlist, not lottery, but still felt like winning the lottery).  I stimmed for 9 days, got 24 eggs, 23 mature, 16 fertlized with ICSI, and we transferred one 5-day blast (4BB) with 4 more frozen.   The transfer was unsuccessful, and I wanted to take a step away from all of this stuff over the holidays and pretend like I wasn't dealing with all of this shit.   \n\nOur Clinic has run out of OHIP funding for this fiscal year for IVF treatments, so our first FET has been delayed until April (possibly).   We have still yet to receive our protocol for FET (it's been 8 weeks since my negative beta), so I followed up with our clinic today.  The clinic assured me it would be in the mail shortly - orders had been written, they are just \"beyond swamped\" due to the influx of patients with the new OHIP funding.  So that's annoying, but the FET is a few months away, so I can be patient.\n\nMy question today for you wonderfully helpful people is around painful periods...  I've always had relatively short/light/painfree periods with minor cramps.   When I was on birth control, I was on progesterone-based ones meaning no periods for over 6 years.   As I've been off birth control, my period has gotten progressively more painful slowly,  with a noticible change I would say in the last 5 months or so.   In the last two cycles, I've had some sharp pain with bowl movements on my period, and from what Dr.Google has told me this could be linked with endo.   So when I called my clinic today, I asked about maybe needing to follow up with my RE prior to FET.  For the first time ever in dealing with a Nurse, I was super frustrated with her response.   She said any changes are worthy of a follow up, but that this issue is gynecological in nature, so I should talk to my family doctor and then see a gynecologist if necessary.  My RE is for fertility issues only.   Here is my thing - COULDN'T THIS BE A FREAKING FERTILITY ISSUE?   What are your thoughts?  Should I just book an appointment with my RE?  Or should I go to my family doctor and get her thoughts first?  \n\nThanks for your thoughts/input, and making it to the bottom of my wall of text.

I felt lucky to even get to that point. \n\nBut in addition to wanting to come out of the woodwork and make myself known to the ONLY infertility community that really \"gets it\" and doesn't make me want to vomit, I would be interested in your thoughts. \n\nWe'll be back at the RE for another IVF cycle soon.

I didn't have a \"real\" period for 6 months, and was extremely worried, especially since many pregnancy tests came back negative, so I knew I wasn't pregnant. However, I did get a (seemingly, at least) normal period in November, and was briefly relieved thinking that my periods had finally returned. However, It's been nearly 3 months since then and I haven't even had so much as spotting. I've also been having unprotected sex off and on this whole time and have not gotten pregnant (still taking pregnancy tests, all coming back negative), which is understandable because no period = no ovulation. \nHas anyone else experienced anything like this before?

I have openly railed to rally others to share in my anger and act by calling their reps...  I marched last Sat in Seattle before knowing of this bill but my personal reasons were to stand for my rights as a woman.  \n\nHice's office said \"oh we're not anti-ivf, that's not what this is\"...  And I asked...  So what about pgs testing and if we chose not to transfer a bad embryo? \"Oh...  I don't know the answer to that.\"  Right because you didn't think about that.  And they vowed to get back to me with answers.  I have sent both th messenger and fb page message with the list of questions resolve poses as issues with a personhood bill...  I don't expect answers but I think I may call every day and ask them one by one daily.  \n\nI've contacted my RE to express my concern.

In the past it's gone no where...  But we have a GOP controlled house and senate here and a president who I can't depend on to veto this if it does happen to go forward to that point.  And a VP if somehow the president is impeached that wants personhood.  \n\nSo here we are...  With a hard conversation.  The uncertainty of IF and IVF being successful is hard enough.  \n\nPlease, don't stop talking about this.  We have to speak up...  We have to be loud.  \n\nI know we're all strapped for cash, but get involved...  Support RESOLVE if you can.

So good on you folks, this seems like a very healthy community for a very difficult topic. \n\nI joined so that I could share the story that my wife and I have lived to date, to get an outside perspective and perhaps to get some information/advice from other 'infertility veterans.'\n\nWe married in Fall, 2013 and were already trying to get pregnant. She had been on birth control since the age of 17, and she was 33 when we were married. We got pregnant very quickly and were ecstatic. 10 weeks later, she had the first of many miscarriages. \n\nWe have had a total of 6 pregnancies, and 6 miscarriages. We are on our second fertility specialist. The first clinic we worked with had a very standardized protocol, almost a flow chart that they took every patient through... if this happens, you do this, if that happens, you do that. \n\nWe wanted a more personalized, flexible and adaptable approach so after a year we made a switch. \n\nOur current doctor is great. After the 6th miscarriage, she had to have a DNC. During the post-DNC check-up, one of the awesome doctors at our new clinic spotted a septum in her uterus, which meant another procedure to remove it plus a plastic 'guitar pick baloon' (I don't know how else to describe it) to form her uterus correctly and prevent the septum from coming back. \n\nRemoving the septum gave us renewed hope after 3+ years of trying and way too many miscarriages. We did three IUI's, all failed. \n\nI guess I should also mention at this point, every test done on my sperm has shown no issues. I don't say that to brag, just to provide context and information. \n\nAfter those unsuccessful IUI's, we received major help from our families and moved forward with IVF (trying to remember the protocol, antagonist something...). We had some hiccups with the shots at first, but my wife is a damn trooper and we got through it. \n\nThey retrieved 13 eggs, only two were fertilized so they did a fresh transfer a few days later. \n\nThis past monday, on my birthday of all days, we received news that her pregnancy test was negative. So here we are, just waiting for her period to come and trying to figure out what in the hell we do next. \n\nWhere I am looking for help/advice is twofold: \n\n1) Her body/mind are so ravaged by three straight years of hormones/shots/procedures that I think she needs a break from all of that and I'm asking her to just try naturally for 2-4 months. The wife gets fertility acupuntcure/massage/chiropractic/herbal treatments (on top of everything else, sheesh) and those folks all agree with me, luckily. \n\nHas anyone else out there taken a break from all of the 'science' stuff and had success? Any other suggestions? \n\n2) My wife has gotten really depressed through this entire process. She does see a therapist that specializes in folks struggling with infertility, but I feel her emotions and attitude are going to a very dark place. Every mention of pregnancy on TV or in a movie, anyone she knows that becomes pregnant or has children, they are all treated with disdain, anger and just cut off. \n\nI am not naive to the fact that these are very legitimate and understandable reactions, and I've found myself feeling anger and jealousy when I see friends making pregnancy or birth announcements... but this is another level. She has completely cut her younger sister out of her life because she had a child and wasn't trying to do so. She has a very close friend that she has cut off, and a lifelong friend who also suffered through infertility but has finally had success - both cut off. Mostly, it's the overwhelming anger that she suffers from that concerns me. I am concerned that her outlook and attitude is having a negative effect on our own infertility struggles... it feels like it's a cycle, the negativity feeds into the infertility, and our continued struggles feeds into the negativity. \n\nI need advice on breaking that cycle. I'm going to talk to our doctor today and let him know my thoughts. We are scheduled for a meeting with him tomorrow morning to make a plan going forward and I want him to help back me up. \n\nAny advice or information would be great, especially from women who might have struggled with some of the same feelings my wife is experiencing. I surely do not have the same experience that she does and I recognize that I will never fully understand it. I also know that many of those feelings are normal and legitimate... but I honestly believe that what she is experiencing is beyond the norm and bordering on dangerous. \n\nThanks to you all for creating such a great community here, and thank you in advance for reading all of this craziness.
