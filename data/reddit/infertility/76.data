Sorry for making another standalone post. I\u2019m struggling immensely mentally right now. To the point I had to see my family doctor urgently today as I felt so mentally low and was worried For my own safety.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying for a baby for over 2 years now. I\u2019m 24 years old (only just) and all we have under our belts is a diagnosis of PCOS for me. I ovulate maybe once every 4-5 months naturally. \n\nAs of yet, weight loss has not helped at all. Supplements, have not helped at all. Clomid worked once and then did not work again afterwards - I was offered a third medicated cycle but did not feel emotionally stable enough to do it again. I\u2019m back at the fertility clinic on the 15th May for a HyCosy, so I may try again. \n\nI\u2019ve never been pregnant in my life. I\u2019ve never even seen a positive pregnancy test.\n\nThe fertility clinic recently offered my husband a sperm analysis. It only took 2 years for them to finally offer it. \n\nA few days ago the results came back saying his sperm count is perfect, so is everything else. I\u2019m not going to lie, my bitter ass cried over it because now I know I\u2019m the issue. I\u2019m the problem. He could go and have sex with another woman and get her pregnant. I can\u2019t give him what we both want.\n\nI\u2019m carrying the entire weight of this infertility on my own shoulders. I\u2019ve no idea what is wrong with my body and why I can\u2019t conceive, why I can\u2019t give my husband a baby. I\u2019m awaiting investigations and investigations take time, I\u2019ve lost patience.\n\nEver since I was a child I\u2019ve had problems with inadequacy because i was emotionally abused by my mother. These feelings are now out in full force, smacking me in the face every day because I am 100% inadequate and I\u2019m the one in my marriage that can\u2019t have a child. I hate myself. I hate my fucking body. \n\nI\u2019ve had an AMH test done, and a whole bunch of ultrasounds, and the only thing that has ever turned up is that I have PCOS. PCOS on the black and white screen and PCOS running through my fucking blood. \n\nI have a therapist and she said to me just today \u201cYou need to realise your body isn\u2019t just a vessel to carry a baby.\u201d Yeah, maybe that helps some infertile women but it doesn\u2019t help me. The only thing I want my body to do is carry a baby. I don\u2019t want anything else in life!!! If this vessel can never carry a baby then I don\u2019t want to be any part of it. \nLife has not always been great to me. As I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t many women here. I had absolutely no family life growing up, and I wanted children more than anything for that reason. I would be such a good mother. \nWe have our own 4 bedroomed house, we\u2019ve both got good jobs, we\u2019ve done everything right but yet this is all so wrong.\n\nHow do you all cope? I just cannot stop crying today.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12751, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do I cope knowing my husband is perfectly fertile and I\u2019m the issue", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557514930, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bke57p/how_do_i_cope_knowing_my_husband_is_perfectly/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "FanciestPansiest", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3phmm68i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556924384, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bkeo3d/testosterone_and_fertility/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bkeo3d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/bkeo3d/testosterone_and_fertility/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1556924385, "score": 2, "selftext": "So, my husband recently had a overall health check &amp; blood draw.

Use your best discretion as some comments do necessitate a response.\n\nWelcome to the Infertility Results thread and discussion! You can post the outcome of your cycle here (be it positive or negative) in a way that is sensitive to the emotional needs of our unique community. **For the sake of members who are struggling with negative results and the difficult feelings that come with them, we request that all pregnancy announcements be shared only in this thread.** Partners/spouses are welcome to share the news here as well. This thread is for those to discuss early pregnancy, so long as you qualify with primary or secondary infertility, social infertility, pregnancy loss after infertility, and/or recurrent loss, regardless of treatment type or status. Please keep in mind that not everyone posting in this thread will be in the same positive head space, so take the lead of each OP and what he/she needs. \n\nMaybe you need to talk about your concerns but you aren't ready to move over to IFbabies yet? Or maybe your betas aren't rising like you were hoping? This is a safe space for post positive beta discussions, beta hell, beta limbo, or early IF pregnancy concerns.  Beta hell can be a real bitch, only made worse after infertility and/or previous loss. All results are welcome here, including home pregnancy tests and betas.\n\n**If a doctor has deemed a pregnancy as non-viable, a D&amp;C booked, or medication to induce miscarriage have been prescribed, posts can be moved back to the dailies with a trigger warning.** Any concerns about a potential chemical, miscarriage, bleeding, etc. should stay in here until a physician has confirmed your loss, as sometimes a pregnancy starts out scary and can turn out just fine.\n\nFor a comprehensive Beta database, check out http://www.betabase.info/ for more information on beta based on DPO (DPO = days post transfer + 3, 5, or 6 day embryo; DPO = Days post Insemination for IUI).\n\n**You can find this and past results threads indexed in the top \"Read This\" sticky on the main page.** For the next stage of your journey, you may be interested in posting your story on r/whatworkedforme and we encourage you to continue to share your progress at our sister community, r/InfertilityBabies.

No reason why nothing should be working. Except we finally, finally discovered that I have slow growing follicles. Also, my husband is 31 with a great count and mobility.\n\nWeve been trying for 2 years now. One year with a doctor, and it's been a whirlwind. I was first placed on Clomid, and my body just laughed at the dosage. So I was upped to 150mg. Body said okay and started growing the follicles. Was then put on ovidrel and told to have at it. Nothing. For like 3 cycles at 150mg. Though my lining did suffer and had to be put on Estrace. Also, I finally developed a cyst. \n\nThen we were placed on an IUI plan. Our first one was last month. 150mg of clomid and ovidrel trigger shot. Sperm count was awesome and I had 1 good and 1 potential follicle plus the cyst. Well that ended up with a negative once all was said and done. \n\nSo now, I'm back to a second IUI. My first scan (4/30) showed 15 basal follicles in each side, which I'm told is a good thing and no cyst anymore. This time I've been placed on 5mg of  letrozole for days 3-7 with gonal f shot on days 3, 5, and 7 at 125. I have two sonograms scheduled for Wednesday the 8th and  Friday the 10th. These will let me know if I continue the shots, how many actual follicles we have to play with and when I need to trigger if I need to.\n\nSo that's my story so far.

I've really appreciated all the helpful information that we have received from this sub while on this journey. Thank you to everyone that has contributed over the years. The information gathered here has made us feel more informed and more in control while beginning our journey. I've read a lot of posts from people about buying meds from overseas. After some deliberation we decided to bite the bullet and purchase our meds from [ivfmeds.com](https://ivfmeds.com) several weeks ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately our experience has not been as positive as many of the people who have posted here that have worked with this pharmacy. We ordered our meds and wired the money on April 18th. Due to the passover holiday they were unable to ship the medications until April 24th. By April 26th the tracking through USPS showed the dreaded 'inbound into customs'. The package had been pulled for inspections. By May 2nd I had asked [ivfmeds.com](https://ivfmeds.com) to send a new package since ours would be stuck in customs for too long to reach us before our scheduled cycle. Within a few days the company replied but did not acknowledge my request for new package. I have emailed and called several additional times with no response. It now looks like we'll have to order our meds locally paying full price. I have emailed the company about a refund and received no response. I fear that we are out several thousand dollars in addition to all other costs that we will need to pay. I understand that most packages will not get held in customs and that many people will not run into the issues that we have. That being said, I would do research on what each company will do in this situation and find out if they are responsive to calls/emails. The additional stress this has caused in our already stressful situation has been an burden that I was not expecting. Financially, this is money that we do not have to lose.

I don\u2019t want to get too deep into my history, but there\u2019s a good chance that I\u2019m infertile due to cancer treatments, but the conclusive tests seem quite invasive and I don\u2019t want to have to do them unless I need to. \n\nOur original plan was to look into it if we didn\u2019t get pregnant after a year, but it\u2019s been less than 3 months and I already feel like my body isn\u2019t working. I first got my period when I was 12, I had already had cancer twice at that point, and I relapsed once more after, and they were irregular for a few years, but since I was about 15/16 my cycles have been 27-30 days long - all this points to me being fertile. In my blood tests, my progesterone and FSH was normal, but luteinizing hormone was unusually low when it should have been at its highest.

Your sister is trying to get her life back together...\".\nBullshit, I was 12 when you yeeted that child at me and left. And now after two more kids, jailtime, abuse, three rehabs, and 7 years of taking her then she throws a fit because you took her. You now have the state of mind to care for someone but yourself. \n\nThis is why I have depression. And then to top it all off my body decides to tell me \"sorry but you cant have kids\". Oh and the people saying \"your too young to have a kid\" \"live your life first\" \"have fun! Your only young once!\". \n\nI had one. But I want my own now, Because Im ready.

Why can't I have ALL my babies?\n\nJust can't... I even tried fornicating every other day for two months.

Got better when I raised my niece. I could feel pride as I held her, taught her lifes basics, and when she called me mommy... Now she just calls me Katana... Sometimes slipping up and calling me mom... I can't have her, my sister is doing so well! No matter how much she asks everyone... She cant live with me.\n\nPeople tell me I dont understand what its like to have my own kids... People tell me Im too young... People even judge and say Im not ready because of my depression... Depression doesnt define me, and yet to them it does. They think its fine until they look at my history of depression... Then another rejection. Im not an unhinged lunatic, Im just sad most of the time. \n\nAfter all the shit life puts me through, now that I found a partner, who loves and supports me. I cant even start a life with them... I cant even afford my fertility treatments... I still have to wait for the fucking district manager to accept me and schedule me for orientation!\n\nI feel like garbage, I cant do anything right. I cant even do what comes naturally. I cant enjoy sex, I cant be happy. i cant even tear down my walls, instead I build a door and window. \n\nIm so ready, I just cant have one... Then the thoughts come in and swollow me whole. I cant stop crying. No... I dont think a child would \"fix\" everything... Im not that dumb... A child would help me heal, not as a crutch but a goal.

Nothing is wrong with him, but I was diagnosed with PCOS at a private clinic where I underwent two rounds of clomid. One made me ovulate and the other did not.\n\nAfter this, we decided we\u2019d try and get referred to an NHS funded fertility clinic, because we don\u2019t have a bottomless pit of money and this is treatment we should be entitled to. I\u2019m 23 and he\u2019s 30. No previous children or pregnancies.\n\nA few months back I saw a wonderful doctor at my GP surgery who ordered blood tests and a sperm analysis. She said she was going to refer us to the local NHS fertility clinic, but needed to do these tests before she could on account they were mandatory for a referral. \nWe\u2019d already had the tests done, but she needed to tick some boxes.\n\nSadly, these tests were delayed because my husband couldn\u2019t produce a sperm sample and had to book another appointment which had a 3 week wait. \n\nWe\u2019ve finally got the results of the sperm sample and as I said above, he is fine. However, when I called my doctors surgery to ask about the doctor filling out the referral form I was told she had left to go on maternity leave (how ironic lmao) so we\u2019d have to see another doctor.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a joint appointment for next week, and the truth is I\u2019m sh*tting myself because the previous doctor who has now left was by far the most helpful and friendly I\u2019ve ever seen on the NHS. I felt we\u2019d really get somewhere with her, but then she had to leave.\n\nThis appointment was for the sole purpose of a doctor filling out our referral form. But my issue is, I\u2019m pretty fat. It\u2019s caused me issues in the past with regards to getting investigations and treatment. I\u2019m aware that the NHS won\u2019t offer me treatment until my weight is under control - but where do we stand on the basis of investigations and a referral to the fertility clinic? \n\nI\u2019m terrified we will go to our appointment next week and the doctor will tell me I\u2019m too fat to be referred and I\u2019ll be back to square one.

This is a great community and I feel supported just reading some of the posts. Let me introduce myself.\n\nI'm almost 33. After 9 months of TTC we went to see an REI who ran all the basic tests. My husband's SA was fine, my AMH was 2.9, FSH \\~4.3, and E2 was \\~25. The AFC however was hard to come by (but I think showed a reasonable number of follicles), because the ultrasound showed what she thought was a gigantic fibroid blocking easy access to the ovaries, which was then confirmed by MRI to be &gt;9cm and pedunculate. A little while later I did the HSG test which, surprisingly (given no risk factors), revealed one blocked and one patent tube. A couple months later I had a laparoscopic myomectomy, during which the surgeon also did a chromopertubation test. This confirmed that I do indeed have one blocked tube and the other tube looks suspiciously like there might be beginnings of blockage in the symmetric site. No endometriosis was seen. This lead to a diagnosis of a congenital tubal factor. The tubes, at least as of the time of myomectomy, were not hydrosalpinges.\n\nPost-myomectomy, we tried for a few more months before finally going back to see a different REI closer to home who our friend referred us to. He's supposed to be a \"hotshot\" REI, and, critically, his clinic has a well respected laboratory. He immediately agreed that the cause of infertility was tubal and suggested IVF. Two months later we decided to go for it, and signed up for the 3-round package, which gives 3 ERs and unlimited FETS until you either run out of embryos or take home a baby.\n\nI showed up on day 2 of my cycle and my AFC was lower than it had ever been (9). The doctor said that I should not use birth control but rather wait until I ovulate and then do the estrogen priming protocol. He also suggested I retest FSH, AMH, and E2. I did, and the FSH and E2 didn't change, but my AMH had apparently plummeted to 0.89. Cue despair #1 of the process. Without getting into too many details, suffice it to say that despite the low AFC, I somehow ended up with 16 eggs which yielded 4 PGS-tested euploid blastocysts (2 day 5 and 2 day 6), and 2 low mosaics. We then waited a cycle and repeated exactly what we did, except this time my AFC was much higher (18) and they kept me on an even lower dose of gonadotropins. The second round produced 21 eggs which yielded 6 more PGS-tested euploid blastocysts (not sure about the day 5/day 6 breakdown because I haven't received the report yet) and 1 low mosaic. I don't know how to explain the discordance between the eggs retrieved/blastocysts developed and the AMH. Perhaps the AMH (and AFC) are not constant in me (though typically they only vary by &lt;10%). Perhaps the myomectomy affected me. I haven't had it retested since then.\n\nIn between cycles I had a saline sonogram done by the surgeon who did the myomectomy which showed that I have an arcuate uterus. (He's probably the best doctor I've ever encountered). Amazingly, after I gave them this diagnosis, the REIs were also suddenly seeing the characteristic cat eyes of the arcuate uterus in ultrasound. (Confirmation bias much?) The response of my REIs was \"we should surgically resect the septum\" and \"we need to do a hysteroscopy to see how deep the septum is.\" This struck me as odd since the REI was telling me that hysteroscopy is the gold standard for distinguishing arcuate and deeper septum, yet, my surgeon and research papers, etc., say that hysteroscopy doesn't tell you the depth all that well, and that MRI is much better at confirming the depth of a septum. More importantly, there really isn't evidence that resection of the dimple of the arcuate uterus does anything to improve live birth rates. Actually, all the evidence as a whole points to women with arcuate uteruses and normal uteruses having no difference in live birth rate whatsoever.\n\nMoving on - I had another MRI, which confirmed arcuate uterus (less than 1cm septum which also matched the measurement from sonogram quite well). It also showed some surprises: an area of adenomyosis (not reported on my previous MRI but appears to have been present there too) and another tiny fibroid that was not present in the previous MRI. It also showed some cysts in my ovaries (probably because I'd only had the ER 2.5 weeks before) and a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac (apparently normal).\n\nSo, most excellent reddit form, what do I do now? I have 10 PGS-tested euploid blastocysts that are on ice. I recognize that this is a lot. If the REI had his way I'd probably be paying him another 7K+ to have the dimple resected, an ERA, and, if we were being really aggressive, taking an extended dose of Lupron or OCP to \"tame\" the adenomyosis, even though I don't think it's causing problems. Neither my surgeon nor the REI are concerned about the new fibroid. My surgeon said he of course can't be sure about the effect of the adenomyosis, but he doesn't think it's clinically relevant. The REI said he's skeptical of diagnosing me with adenomyosis only from MRI... Call me cynical if you like, but I'm just not convinced in the science behind the ERA, and as I said before, to my knowledge there really isn't evidence to back up operating on the arcuate uterus. I tried to get the REI to give me some probability of success from a PGS normal blastocyst, and he said 67-70%, and said \"subtract 10%\" for all of these new uterine findings. Honestly I'm not sure where he got that number from. I think he probably made it up. A few minutes later I asked him what he thought the source of infertility is, tubal or uterine (note that at least 15 months ago or so there was 1 patent tube, suspicious as it may have looked on chromopertubation), to which he replied \"tubal, I don't think there's a problem with your uterus\". At that point I just had to stop pulling teeth to try to get him to give the situation more than the most cursory thought.\n\nThe current plan is to try 2 FETS (since if 1 fails it's basically a coin toss and doesn't teach us much) using a \"natural\" protocol. According to my REI, there's no difference in pregnancy outcome between fully medicated and \"natural\" (which still involves triggering ovulation and progesterone supplementation) protocols, but the natural is more of a hassle as it requires more monitoring. (How surprising the REIs just automatically suggest medicated FETs!!) For some reason that's probably not entirely rational I really want to do a \"natural\" FET. I just intuitively feel better knowing I have a corpus leuteum making estrogen and progesterone. I also really hated taking the estrace and didn't want to have to take so much of it for weeks. The REI agreed to a \"natural\" FET.\n\nIf those 2 FETS fail we can go try all of these other tests (ERA, hysteroscopy), etc. We can also always do the 3rd egg retrieval to get more embryos if necessary (but I do not want to put that off too long since who knows how long my ovaries will behave).\n\nBut, this makes me feel so nervous, even with 10 blastocysts... there are still just so many unknowns. From the beginning I've always been a little doubtful of the tubal factor diagnosis, since one tube did spill. The REIs are so quick to talk about egg quality as the big problem, but luckily that did not turn out to be the issue. But maybe it really is my uterus. Maybe no embryos has ever been able to implant even if it's made it down the one open tube. Should I just do the 3rd ER now while we are likely to get more good embryos and then go for the FET?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for writing a novel here, but if you've made it this far, I welcome any thoughts, opinions, advice. I can still change course!

I called my Dr. and they gave me the usual schpeal and did not have me coming in until the 8 week mark (which I disagreed with, given my fertility issues/previous surgeries thus far, but regrettably didn't speak up). At 7 and a half weeks I was visiting family about 12 hours from home, when I ended up in the hospital for 4 days with a ruptured cornual ectopic on the right side that required emergency surgery and blood transfusion.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy was never on my radar. No one ever mentioned it being a risk. I blame myself. But I also blame my old ob/gyn. I was so naive that while I was unknowingly bleeding out, and getting an ultrasound done to see what was happening, I asked if I could have the ultrasound printed because it was my first....\n\nNow 31yrs old, I had multiple opinions and visits with different doctors post-op to decide what our next step was. I'll save you the tedious details on that but ultimately we decided to wait a year until we try again, to let my uterus heal as long as possible (this coming Oct. 2019). We also found new polyps in my uterine lining back in Dec. at one of my post op checks (my uterus just likes to grow everything other than a baby huh!?). We plan to schedule to have those removed closer to when we are ready to TTC again.\n\nI was just seeing if anyone else has had anything similar happen. The ectopic was on the right side, which is where I DID NOT have a tube. They called it a cornual ectopic because technically it was in the uterus, but in the uppermost corner where the tube would have connected, and where I must have a lot of scar tissue, and now definitely have way more scar tissue.\n\nBaby dust to you all, looking forward to hearing from you if you have a similar story to share!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12837, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cornual ectopic rupture on tubeless side.

I went to the ER in excruciating pain thinking I had appendicitis. Turned out I had a ruptured cyst on my right ovary.  \n\nI went to a follow up appointment a few weeks later in August as recommended, but really didn't like the OBGYN I went to see. I didn't know much about cysts and, as far as I knew, never had one before. He brushed of my questions and concerns without really ever answering them and made it all seem like no big deal. I am not particularly fond of going to drs for that very reason. So I never went for my follow up ultrasound. It was no big deal right?\n\nI went to my annual physical with my PCP and brought her up to speed on what happened over the summer. She said she was more than happy to send me for a follow up ultrasound and we could go from there. I went to that one in January 2018. The results showed two cysts, one on my left ovary and one on my right. My PCP recommended we watch them and go for another ultrasound in 3 months.\n\nApril 2018 I went for the ultrasound. Although the ultrasound techs are not suppose to talk to you about what they see, she recommended I see a specialist since the cysts don't look like normal cysts.  I got a call from my Dr with the results a day or two later. She said that the cysts are still there and have not increased or decreased in size. She said she would be discussing the results with a colleague. A couple days later she referred me to an OBGYN.\n\nIn May I went to the appointment with the OBGYN. She explained to me the results of the ultrasound saying the results show endometriosis. She recommended I have surgery to remove the endometriosis because of the combo of the ultrasound results and the fact that intercourse was excruciatingly painful. \n\nMy laparoscopy was scheduled for June 2018. I was both scared and excited. Scared to have surgery, but excited that intercourse would be pleasurable again and not a chore.\n\nWhen I woke up, my OBGYN came over to me. She said she already spoke with my boyfriend, and she would go into more detail tomorrow, but they didn't take anything out. When she went in, she found it was not endometriosis, but what looked to her link cancer. She had an OBGYN oncologist on call for the two surgeries prior to mine, and called her in. She said that it's NOT cancer. It's called Borderline Tumors. Then she apologized. \n\nI was pretty groggy from anesthesia but my boyfriend explained it again to me. The surgery basically became in exploratory surgery. They took out a sample of the tumor to biopsy. \n\nThe next day my Dr called me to see how I was doing and to explain again what was found. She said she is referring me over to the oncologist that saw me in the OR and asked if I wanted to come in to get the pics of the laparoscopy and she can explain to me what I'm looking at. I said yes.\n\nI went two days later to her office where she showed me that the borderline tumors spread from my left ovary to my right ovary. My entire lower abdominal cavity was filled with stuff that looked like cauliflower. She showed me bits of whites spots on the surface of my liver and diaphragm and explained that is all the borderline tumors as well. Again... not cancer.\n\nA few days later I went and saw the OBGYN oncologist. She said borderline tumors are somewhat rare but they are not cancer. They sort of act like cancer in that it looks like it and spreads. It does not spread nearly as fast as cancer does and does not invade lymph nodes like cancer.  She said it does not require chemo to treat. It is a surgery disease meaning you hace surgery to remove it and you sgould be ok. To be honest.... I still don't really know what it is. There's not much information on it.\n\nI had to have another surgery. Except this surgery, I had no idea what I would be waking up to. The tumors were so bad, she wasn't sure if she would be able to save the ovaries until she got in there. She also needed to send me for an MRI to see if the tumors spread to my lungs. This would also determine how far she needed to cut me open. If it was on my lungs, she would need to cut me from chest to 6 inches below my belly button. If not, then just from my belly button. She said this would be a massive surgery and I would need to take 6 weeks off from work. 6 weeks? I've barely taken 6 days...\n\nMy surgery was scheduled in July 2018, 2 days after my birthday. I'd be 31. The day of my surgery came. God, I was so scared. I had no idea if I'd wake up with 1, 2 or 0 ovaries. When was terrified waiting to go in. Scared for how big of the surgery, scared what would happen, scared that is wake up and everything I've worked so hard for for my future, just gone, in the blink of an eye. \n\nI closed my eyes and when I opened them again, I was in the recovery room.  They wouldn't let my boyfriend come back. I just kept asking. Finally they had some escort him back but said he could only stay for a minute.\n\nI knew they told him. He asked if I wanted to know. I said no, I just didn't want to be alone. Even if just for a minute.  I was finally put in my room where I would be for the next 4 days. I asked people not to visit me. I didn't know what mental state I would be in and didn't want to feel like I had to entertain anyone that came.  I asked my boyfriend before he left for the night what happened. He said surgery went well. The Dr said she got all of the tumors out. It hadn't spread anywhere further that what was seen in the laparoscopy. The left ovary had to be removed. It was too far overcome with the tumors. The right ovary she was able to salvage part of. She cleaned up the part that was still good tissue, and stitched it together.\n\nI still had a chance. Possibility. Hope. Even if I only had half of one ovary to work with. The next few days were a bit of a blur because of the meds.\n\nI was healing up great in the hospital and for the first week home. It wasn't until I had to have my staples removed where everything when down hill again. My incision wasn't healing properly. They had to rip it back open. They put me on a sponge vac until the wound healed. The sponge vac worked to remove necrotic tissue and allow the healthy tissue to grow.  Eventually my incision healed, but I was left with a worse scar than I would have had if my body just did what it was supposed to. \n\nSince I was able to keep part of my ovary, I wasn't cleared out of the woods yet. I still had an ovary..there was a chance that the tumors could come back. I'd need to be monitored.\n\nIn October, I went for a follow up ultrasound. My results showed two small cysts on my ovary. One of them normal. The other too small to tell but was concerning. My OBGYN oncologist referred me to a fertility Dr to get my eggs removed and frozen to preserve my fertility. Just in case that cyst is the tumors coming back.  She pulled out my IUD since my boyfriend and I decided we wouldn't push our luck and start trying to have a baby.\n\nA few weeks later we saw the fertility Dr, but now we were just waiting on me getting my period.  \n\nI had a follow up ultrasound December. It just so happens I got my period as well so fertility was able to get what they wanted to see from the ultrasound all well.  Fertility said everything looked good. Oncology said my cysts reduced in size. This was good news. If it were the tumors coming back, they wouldn't have reduced. My OBGYN oncologist said she'd see me in 6 months for the follow up ultrasound and results. That appointment is scheduled for June. \n\nIn the meantime, I've been working with fertility. By the time January rolled around, I had two normal cycles. With the cycle I had in January,  fertilityhad me doing IVF to get my eggs out and preserved. I did 2 weeks of Gonal F at the highest dose. Nothing. Was. Happening. My ovary wasn't producing mature follicles. We had to cancel it. My body actually did worse with intervention than when I was producing on my own.\n\nJanuary 15th was my last normal period. We were waiting for my cycle to start again to see if I was ovulating, but nothing was happening. Estrogen was too low, progesterone, too low. They put me on provera for 10 days to force my period, and it worked.  \n\nI've baffled my Dr.  We already knew I had a low reserve of eggs. She ruled out menopause, POCS... there is nothing else that could be causing me issues. It just very simply that there was just too much trauma to the ovary for it to function properly.\n\nThere was nothing else she could do for me. I asked the question I didn't want the answer to. \"In your opinion, is it possible I could get pregnant on my own?\" \n\n\"It is very unlikely.\"\n\nNow I wait to go in June to find out if my tumors are coming back, and if I have to remove the last bit of hope from my body.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12837, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Not sure what I'm looking for here.

I haven\u2019t set up a flair yet so here it is: 34/Unexplained/TTC#1/Cycle 16\n\nBackground: been trying for about 1.5yrs, never conceived, no chemical, no MC.  Had my Day 3 bloodwork done (all good) and had HSG done (all good).   Husband\u2019s SA done (extremely good).   So the problem is with me, somewhere somehow.  \n\nConcern: I\u2019ve had chlamydia in the past from an ex, likely for many years before diagnosis so I\u2019m worried it\u2019s done some hard to detect damage.   Hence, I requested a hysteroscopy before seeking IVF treatment.   BUT the OBGYN doesn\u2019t feel like I need it, he says he trusts the results of my HSG and that I should just go straight to a fertility clinic for treatment.  My fertility clinic also only suggests a hysteroscopy if I have failed IVF rounds.  \n\nBut shouldn\u2019t I make 100% sure my uterus/uterine lining are good to conceive (no undetected scarring/adhesions/fibroids/polyps etc) before I throw a bunch of money at IVF? (It\u2019ll be all out of pocket). \n\nSo, should I take the doctors\u2019 advice to skip the hysteroscopy and start treatment or insist on it given my Chlamydia history to make super sure?  What would you do?\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 12837, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should I get a hysteroscopy before IVF?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557649227, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/bmnwys/should_i_get_a_hysteroscopy_before_ivf/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}]}
