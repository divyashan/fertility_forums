I went to the ob-gyn today (she had put me on Vitex back in March to re-regulate, but it clearly ain't working) and she was concerned by my charts and took my blood to test for all the stuff, LH, FSH, et cetera.

I don't have PCOS and am otherwise healthy, but for reasons as stated above, I am pretty convinced there is something wrong with my fertility and it's already starting to make me feel very depressed. I work with kids and also hear a lot of talk about having kids, pregnancies (including pregnant co-workers) and also hear a lot of rather insensitive offhand comments about having babies and being able to have babies.

He thought it might help with some of the constant questioning we've been getting. This surprised me, because he's usually the more private one, but maybe he just wants a way to tell people to quit asking.\n\nFor context, we live in a very heavily Mormon community where it seems like everyone is popping out babies right and left. We've been married/trying for over a year, but I have endo and he has a varicocele (but a pretty normal SA). We get a lot from well-meaning friends, family, and church members about how \"having children is part of God's plan\" and \"preventing children when you're capable of caring for them is just selfish.\" Our parents know that we're having difficulty, so that's makes things a little easier, but it's the comments from friends and extended family that really get to us. I'm one of the oldest grandchildren on my side (and the only married grandchild of any of my grandparents), and my cousin just had a baby out of wedlock so now it seems like everyone's expecting us to be next which will make the holidays a joy, I'm sure. The comments from church members are hurtful too, because we're honestly trying to live what we believe and it feels a bit like we're being shunned for our inability to procreate.\n\nRight now, I'm looking for ideas for what to say, probably on Facebook. Mostly, I want people to know that we appreciate that they're thinking of us, but that the constant hinting about whether or not I'm pregnant yet is starting to become hurtful.\n\nTl;dr: how did you let friends and family know about your infertility?

I am trying to do less of that, but I am planning to apply to graduate school in the next year or so my husband is finishing his grad progam and will be searching for a new (possibly lower paying to start off) job soon and so we do need to consider potential pregnancy and possible future treatments in our life planning process. \n\nThe thing I am really struggling with is how to decide when to pull the trigger on the next steps. I have been trying for over a year, I had a blocked left tube cleared in August, and then that ovary promptly developed a large cyst two weeks later (no known PCOS though). Then I had an uncommonly short cycle, now followed by an uncommonly long one. (Going to the RE next week for follow up on the cyst etc). At my last appointment they mentioned Femera for me and I said I would think about it before I came in for my follow up.\n\nI am really struggling with the decision (and all decisions it feels like). I am really afraid of multiples (we couldn't afford for me to go to school if we had twins, we live in a very expensive city with costly childcare and housing costs), but I am feeling like it is probably time to take the step toward medications. And then my anxiety kicks in... how long would I do that without success before heading to IVF (we would skip IUI). I don't want to wait too long, but I don't want to rush in to anything unnecessarily either. I want to make these decisions thoughtfully,  fully respecting what the process entails and the toll that it takes. I don't want to make rash decisions, but I don't want to put things off too long or procrastinate too much either. At 32 my AMH was \"okay, but not great\" (2.1)\n\nHow did you guys decide to take the next steps, with each step you took? Do you wish you looked at it differently?

Now, my regular dr was out of town, so I had another one that I've never met do it, and she said that we will not do an IUI this month because my follicles were so small. \n\nI know this issue is minute compared to a lot of other issues on here, but this was a low blow this month. I really had my hopes up that we could do this IUI next week, and now I just feel hopeless. \n\nI talked with my nurse afterward, and she said she was going to talk to my real Dr on Monday to see what he wanted to do. She said he may want me to come back up for another ultrasound next week sometime. \n\nMy nurse also said that since I don't respond to Clomid or Femara, our next option would be Gonal-f or Follistim, which they are hesitant to do because they really want to avoid multiples if possible, and since I'm so young, I would have an increased chance of that. At this point though, I just don't care. I'll take anything I can get, and I have to try all of the cheaper options before we consider IVF. \n\nSo what are some experiences with either of these meds, and how much did they cost? My nurse said they were expensive, but she gave me a paper with some websites that may give them to me for a special price.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gonal-f/Follistim", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3ptp9u/gonalffollistim/"}, {"author": "Whisgo", "author_created_utc": 1431760692, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "32 yrs | POF | Lupus + MTS | (DE)IVF try #4 next year", "author_fullname": "t2_ni5qz", "created_utc": 1445549632, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1445549883, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3ptqkt/mthfr_and_me/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3ptqkt", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3ptqkt/mthfr_and_me/", "retrieved_on": 1450713132, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So...  I talked to my mom a few weeks ago and she brought up the placental abruption she had with my brother. The key thing that stuck out was that when she was hospitalized with that they said her folic acid levels were really low. I don't think I've ever been tested for mthfr - never thought about it since I was already on lovenox to deal with the anticardiolipin antibodies.\n\nbut now I'm like... what if I'm not getting the right type of folic acid?\nand then... I realize... I have my DNA break down from 23andme... and there is internet... and genetic genie...\n\nwhat have I done?!\n\nYou have 1 heterozygous (yellow) mutation(s). These are generally not as bad as red homozygous mutation, but they may still worth paying attention to. They include:\nMTHFR C677T\n\nOne function of MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) is to help convert homocysteine to methionine. A MTHFR C677T mutation means that the MTHFR enzyme may have trouble performing its task leading to high levels of homocysteine. According to Dr. Ben Lynch, impaired function of the enzyme can cause or contribute to conditions such as Autism, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Miscarriages, IBS, many birth defects, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Bipolar Disorder, blood clots, Stroke, Chemical Sensitivity, and many other conditions.\n\nMTHFR C677T can also lead to high homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine can be related to MTHFR C677T mutations. While homozygous (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-) mutations indicates reduced activity of this enzyme, it does not necessarily mean there will be high homocysteine levels in a clinical setting.\n\nAs S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) accumulates, the COMT enzyme may become impaired. Inhibitiion of COMT can increase dopamine levels in COMT V158M (-/-), but for those with COMT V158M (+/+), the high level of SAH can lead to behavior problems and mood swings according to Dr. Amy Yasko.\n\nMy COMT V158M was also heterozygous.\n\nnot exactly dr google..  but...  yeah...  sent that shit to my RE.  why the fuck not...\n\nETA: my cousin died of spina bifida at birth...  my other cousin, her sister is now trying and has the chromosome anomaly my mom has which causes turner's in girls (like myself) so she's been to a geneticist and will be going to an RE for a full workup there.  She mentioned they have her on 4000mg folic acid daily...  we had a talk.  At the very least I can provide her with as much information as I can so maybe she won't have to fuck with miscarriages and avoid that shit.  \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "MTHFR and me...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3ptqkt/mthfr_and_me/"}, {"author": "Hookah_Hooker", "author_created_utc": 1396159176, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "IVF #1 -31 August", "author_fullname": "t2_fwuh8", "created_utc": 1445564077, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3pumz9/just_got_home_from_retrieval/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3pumz9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3pumz9/just_got_home_from_retrieval/", "retrieved_on": 1450712712, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Three.

She did say, however, that my values were \"borderline\".\n\nShe suggested that we start, as a first step, with ovulation inducing drugs to be able to accurately time intercourse. The drug she prescribed is called Predalon 5000 I. E. and I think I have gathered from the information leaflet inside that the active ingredient is \"chorionic gonadotropin\" (it's all in German, und my Detusch ist leider about as schlecht as it gets). She was told that she has to give herself injections in her lower abdomen at 6 AM for two days, and that we should have sex on those days.\n\nNow here's the problem: neither of us has any experience with giving injections, and I had never even heard of injections being delivered in that part of the body, so I wanted to ask if any of you have experience with this kind of medication. How do you perform the injection? To further complicate matters, the information leaflet says \"Die L\u00f6sung wird langsam in einen Muskel (in das Ges\u00e4\u00df, den Oberschenkel oder den Oberarm)\ngespritzt.\" which, according to Google Translate, means \"The solution is slowly into a muscle (the buttock, the thigh or upper arm) injected.\" - so no mention of belly/lower abdomen injections here.\n\nAlso, should we have intercourse immediately after the first injection? Should we wait until evening? I'm thinking that since my motility tends to decrease with time, it may be better to wait a few hours, but I'm not really sure.\n\nYou'd think being told that I'm \"not infertile\" would have cheered me up, but it didn't. I don't care much about being \"clinically fertile\". All I care about is having a child. What use is having most (but not all...) numbers slightly above the WHO defined thresholds if I still can't get my wife pregnant?\n\nThanks for reading this, and sorry for the wall of text.\n[](/GNU Terry Pratchett)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone here have any experience with ovulation-inducing self-injections?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3q0tl5/does_anyone_here_have_any_experience_with/"}, {"author": "JessicaRahbbit", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1445699466, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3q1ce8/im_a_new_egg_donor_looking_for_perspective_from_a/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3q1ce8", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 41, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3q1ce8/im_a_new_egg_donor_looking_for_perspective_from_a/", "retrieved_on": 1450709513, "score": 12, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I considered surrogacy first because I missed being pregnant but didn't want another child (I have two).

She stepped into my life when my biological mother wouldn't and now I consider her my mom. She was there for me, so she is my Mom.\n\nSo dna means very little to me. The implications that 'another me' will be out there means nothing. That child will be the child of their parents, the people who are there for them.\n\nBut now that I'm registered and waiting to get selected, I keep trying to imagine things from the other side. Reading stories from couples who've used donor cells and how hard it was to accept. It seems like it becomes'not a big deal' in their pregnancy but before hand....it's absolutely a last resort.\n\nSo I'm conflicted...I want to help a couple add to their family. I want to help. I want to just be thought of as a helper, not the 'biological parent'. But I know if I was in that position, Id be angry. Id flip through profiles and hate every one. Id feel unsure of what I meant in everything....was I just a body to grow a baby?\nWould people's attitudes towards me be different if they knew the truth?\n\nThen I see stories about children of donors who feel confused or Angry or don't care.\n\nIm sorry if this is the wrong sub. I've been looking at this sub for months trying to understand everything and I've gained a lot of respect for these strong women who want to be a mom they are willing to fight mountains. I've cried, thinking about how many ups and downs experienced.\nThe closest I've come to your pain was a chemical pregnancy. It hurt. Yet some ladies go through that over years. God...if i can help make that journey end in diapers...\n\nSo I'm not sure what my question is. I'm just concerned that instead of being a blessing, I'm the last option being picked and the mother to be will hate me. Will hate that Im part of their process.\n\nDna means nothing to me but I know it means a lot to others.\n\nI wish I could talk to any recipients and tell them that I have no influence on how amazing their kid will be. That will be all on them.\n\nI don't know how to stop feeling guilty...how does anyone 'pick' me without hating my guts?\n\n\nI'm sorry I'm rambling...i just didn't think about the other perspective until I was registered and reading stories.\n\nI don't know how to feel.

I'm heading out the door to take my cat to the vet, but I'll proofread later. :) )\n\nHere is pac\u2019s update:\n\n&gt;We got word yesterday that he has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, which typically has a poor prognosis and treatment is palliative. However, his oncologist said that the surgeons are very optimistic that they can provide curative care, and with chemo and surgery, they feel that they may be able to remove it all. It will be a 9-12 month course of treatment if it all goes as planned.\nHe even discussed the option for banking sperm in case we wanted to, but said we may not even want to because the rate of infertility with this kind of chemo is very low. We are full of hope and surrounded by love, and are so grateful for every prayer and wish sent his way. I would be happy to share my address with you, if you'd like. Please don't feel like you need to send anything at all, but if you do, it will be received with love and appreciation. If you would like to share any or all of that with the group, you're more than welcome to. I have been meaning to post an update, but we've been swimming through information and plans and getting ready for his treatment- he has a small procedure tomorrow to biopsy one more thing, and then he starts chemo on Monday!\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for your responses so far.  I'm going to look into the PayPal option to see if it's something that works for me, and I'll update this later tonight or tomorrow morning.  Also, I've decided to repost this once or twice a week or so until the deadline for those who might miss it.  \n\nEDIT 2:  I've got PayPal set up, so if anyone want to do that instead of a gift card, just let me know and I'll send you the email associated with it, so you can find me.

However, I've been contemplating something in the meantime and wonder if anyone has had similar experiences or feedback.\n\nMy current job (which I'm not super happy about anyways, and have been thinking of quitting for quite some time) involves working with kids. The building that houses the school also contains a preschool, so the kids in the building range from baby age to ten years old. Essentially, I'm surrounded by pregnancy, babies and kids constantly;  and constantly subject to discussions about these topics. Whenever I remotely don't feel well (nauseous etc) a couple of my colleagues automatically ask if I'm pregnant. (Seriously). So to sum it up, it is really not an ideal environment psychologically to be dealing with infertility. \n\nThe other factor is, if it turns out that I am going to need to do IUI's or IVF, that's automatically going to mean missing work sometimes, and from what I've heard about these procedures, they can be debilitating both mentally and physically. I feel like coupled with being surrounded by a less-than-ideal work environment and potential constant medical procedures, this might really be the time to leave the job, depending on my results.\n\nIn summary, I'm wondering if any of you guys have dealt with this dilemma-- has anyone else worked in a similar environment and quit for similar reasons? If so, did you tell your boss specifically what was going on, or did you keep it private? This is another factor--if I do decide to quit in part due to infertility issues, do I really have to tell my boss about it?\n\nThanks so much.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pre-emptive question: work and infertility", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3q51i3/preemptive_question_work_and_infertility/"}, {"author": "fab93", "author_created_utc": 1430224184, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "29 MFI (using donor sperm now) Low AMH/DOR Moving on to IVF #4", "author_fullname": "t2_n684a", "created_utc": 1445786648, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3q5np8/hairloss_with_ivf/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3q5np8", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3q5np8/hairloss_with_ivf/", "retrieved_on": 1450707500, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I swear I'm not crazy, but I think my hair \"sheds\" more when I'm stimming.

I feel silly for not doing so until now, since it\u2019s so simple. But all I can do is start now. Backstory: I have PCOS and irregular periods (obviously). I just started Metformin about 4 weeks ago. We are waiting to let the Metformin get in my system fully. Per the RE, we are trying on our own while tracking my ovulation and letting the Vitamins and Metformin he prescribed build up. We can do this for as long as we\u2019re comfortable. We can call the RE and schedule an IUI whenever we\u2019re ready to take that step. So, we\u2019ve been doing the OPK\u2019s (pee strips) since CD10. We\u2019ve also been having the sex every other day since then. On the strip, I have seen a faint line (the box says the test line will be as dark or darker than the control line when ovulating) on most days since CD10. But never a dark line. It is now CD19\u2026. I have had cervical mucus most days this past week (I haven\u2019t been keeping track). So\u2026.why no dark line? I heard that people do the OPKs at the same time everyday, and not when they\u2019ve had too much to drink, etc. Is it that finicky? Could I have ovulated and not caught it on the strip? I mean, I feel comfortable that having sex every other day is covering it in case I did ovulate. But I feel like we\u2019re flying blind here. And if we are to do an IUI in the next few months, I think the RE would like to know what day on average I ovulate. I have no fucking clue what I would tell him. Any advice or opinions would be extremely welcome.

He was in a pushbike accident that rendered it impossible.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis all changed when last year, my husband and I had been trying to get pregnant for 4 months and he somehow knocked a girl up.  \nAt the time, I didn\u2019t really care. I didn\u2019t know we would still be struggling when she was close to giving birth and I honestly held out hope the entire time that he really couldn\u2019t have kids and it was someone else\u2019s.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFast forward to September, my fertility doctor told us we would need IVF to conceive (luckily we had embryos saved up from when I had cancer) and so we started scrambling trying to find the money.  \nIt really amazes me how expensive it is to even just do the embryo transfer. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting that. And all the medication! I have spent nearly $200 just on the medication for the lead up to the transfer and I need to spend another $200 if I get a positive pregnancy test to keep taking it all until I\u2019m 7 weeks pregnant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the end of September, I\u2019d gone through nearly another entire cycle because we just couldn\u2019t afford to do it yet (we could afford it but other things would have suffered) and that\u2019s when my parents offered to pay for our transfer costs.\nWe gratefully accepted the offer and started planning for the next cycle.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFast forward a few weeks, I\u2019ve had my transfer and hopefully it\u2019s worked. I am able to test on the 30th.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy husband and I were at my grand-parent\u2019s house having dinner and this is how the conversation went:  \nMum: \"How are you feeling with all the medication mrsthomo?\"  \nmrsthomo: \"Yeah, I\u2019m fine.\" (Trying to brush it off)  \nGrandma: \"Why wouldn\u2019t you be fine, what kind of medication are you on?\"  \nmrsthomo: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (Can\u2019t think of anything\u2026 awkward pause) \"We\u2019re doing IVF.\"  \nGrandma: \"Oh riiight, how far along are you?\"  \nmrsthomo: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.  \nMum: \"You know I told you the other day, grandma!\"  \nGrandma: \"Oh yess. So when do we find out?\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I think my mother is telling everyone, which probably includes my brother who doesn\u2019t have the right to know anything about me. And I just feel crushed.  \nThe entire year that we were trying for a baby I dreamed about baking little duck shaped cookies to announce a pregnancy but now it won\u2019t be a surprise and I\u2019m really struggling with all of this.  \nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so scared that if I say something about her yapping about it to everyone and then we need more treatment then she will tell us to go fuck ourselves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hate this so much. This is not how it was supposed to be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy mum also thinks that I care about my brother because I gave them some nappies, picked up their stroller and car seat the week before the baby was born and found information on where they could get the car seat fitted last minute while she was in hospital in labor. Because they didn't bother.  \nThe reason I did all of this is because I am extremely concerned for this child's well being. It has nothing to do with my brother or his girlfriend whom I have never even met.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR My parents paid for our IVF and my mother is telling everyone! I don't really know how I can stop her because I'm afraid if I say something she will withdraw their offer to help us. (She is very unreasonable)  \nDeadbeat brother knocked GF up and I'm struggling with that as well.
