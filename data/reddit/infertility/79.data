She told me the dosage of the Valium also.\nI take Valium anyway occasionally for my anxiety to help me sleep, and let me tell you it barely does anything for me.

We were both going through this infertility struggle together and both started IVF treatment around the same time(for the entire picture, we were both experiencing secondary infertility). During all this we were exchanging texts and leaning on each other a bit. In some ways it brought us even closer, or at least in more regular contact than we had been in. I really appreciated her support and humor during so much of this. I was slightly ahead of her time-wise in my treatment schedule and had success after my first round. She however, did not. She proceeded to finish out 2 more retrievals, with no embryos to show for it. After all that, she has stopped (or at least taken a break from treatment) due to financial and emotional strain. \n\nDuring all this, our communication slowed down. I told her about my success and have not been the one to bring it up again. I have reached out repeatedly to see how she was doing, but have also tried to respect her space. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing - we have a large group of friends from college (about 9 of us) who all get together every few years - traveling from all over with families and spouses to stay together in a house and just spend the weekend all together. That weekend is coming up and I\u2019m concerned about how she is going to feel with me being there and starting to show. I want to reach out and let her know how much I love her and how I want to do anything to help her feel better during this time, but I just feel like my mere existence will be upsetting. Before all this, we had even talked about me and my family spending the night before the big weekend with her and her family, but nothing has been mentioned since and the trip is in just a couple weeks. She is one of my favorite people who will be on this trip, and I so want to be able to hang out with her and carve out quality time like we usually do, but I feel like everything is different. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it? Maybe not...\n\nWhat can I do to help her feel comfortable, supported and loved? What do I say? I\u2019m so scared of saying the wrong thing.

I\u2019m new to all this and recently found this sub whilst browsing reddit.\n\nIm in a lesbian relationship and we are due to start our first cycle of IVF next month with a known donor. We would have originally liked to do IUI but I have incredibly irregular periods. My last period was in November of 2018. Medical reasoning for this is PCO ( fertility specialist told us) \n\nThis morning, my RE emailed me through a treatment protocol. On this protocol it says the following-\n\nFrom day 18 of the cycle before the actual treatment cycle, commence Norethisterone 5mg twice a day for a minimum of ten days. As you start Norethisterone it is essential that you contact your nurses who will review your dates and advise when you should discontinue Norethisterone as this will help us to manage the treatment cycle. A withdrawl bleed (period) will commence 2-5 days after discontinuing the notethisterone. \n\nSo what does this mean? I don\u2019t get periods therefore my cycles go on for days and days at a time! My current cycle is in the 200s.\n\nWill the clinic induce a bleed for me and then put me on Norethisterone from day 18 of that cycle? That all seems a little lengthy and pointless. With that protocol we won\u2019t even start the IVF until October or later. \nWhen I saw the RE he reassured me they would give me something to induce a bleed for me to start my injections. It seems now that they will have to induce a bleed and then I\u2019ll have to wait until day 18 of that \u2018cycle\u2019 to then wait for ANOTHER bleed after 10 days on the Norethisterone before I even start my injections. \n\nIs this commonplace?

When we started this journey, I decided that I needed to start taking care of myself after many years of anorexia and not a lot of self-love. I wanted to embrace my body as something beautiful that would bring children into the world. I gained a healthy amount of weight, I made an effort to exercise for fun instead of as a means of pain and control, I tried to get enough sleep, I increased my water intake, and I took time to relax and do things I enjoyed instead of working myself to death. The bags under my eyes disappeared, I couldn't see my ribs or hip bones anymore, I gained a womanly shape, and I saw my smile in the mirror more often. I went from a size 2 to a size 6, 105 pounds to 140 pounds at 5'7.\"\n\nI've maintained this through the heartbreaking journey of not being able to achieve our goal of having a child. However, the more time that passes weakens my resolve to want to try to take care of myself anymore. We are about to try a new treatment to achieve success, and I feel like a uterus with a bunch of statistics floating over my head. I'm not looking forward to taking a bunch of hormones that will mess up my cycle and make me moody and swollen again. I don't want to be poked and prodded and injected and put in a queue to wait for all of these appointments anymore. I just feel like I am a body and spirit walking along separately. I am not connected to this walking specimen of stretch marks and hormones anymore and that is how I feel like I am being treated. \n\nI hate that my loved ones who used to say \"you are too skinny\" are now telling me that I need to control my eating and lose weight if I am to be in prime health for a pregnancy. I hate that no one in my life thinks to check on me and my mental health when I cry myself to sleep most nights with the miserable feeling that I am not performing my most basic function as a woman. I feel like I am trying so hard to keep it together and to be healthy and love myself and most people just want to tell me I am not trying hard enough. I am working less to have more time for appointments and mental health. I have been questioned by our families and some of my closer coworkers since our treatments aren't cheap and I apparently need to contribute more financially. \n\nI guess I just don't feel like myself anymore.

Bloods showed an anovulatory cycle and my husband has had a SA which showed 'very severe' problems. Great.\n\nSo now I'm freaking myself out. I work for the NHS and have seen IVF, it's something I always said I wouldn't have. But now thanks to my knowledge from my job and some reading on the Internet I'm lead to believe Icsi will probably be what's offered. I am terrified about how invasive everything is getting. I'm terrified about how long everything is going to take. I'm terrified my mum won't be here if we ever have a child.

I had a laparotomy in which they cut me from my belly button straight down to remove a mass and infection which I almost died from. When I went into that surgery they told me the may have to remove my left ovary and Fallopian tube - but didn't. Since then I had generally accepted that **THIS** **circumstance** may make it difficult/impossible to get pregnant and carry a baby.\n\nCut to today, I am single, 35F (36 in August), and was having some anxiety about being in the dating pool not knowing if I could have children or not. I didn't want to take that option away from a man who knew with certainty he wanted kids - because I didn't know if it was possible anyway. So, my MD refers me to a fertility clinic and I have a complete workup done. Just for some peace of mind and to confirm my suspicions.\n\nI had my final results this week and I am a bit shaken. The MD says that the *good news* is that the surgery had almost no impact whatsoever on my ability to conceive and carry a child; very minimal internal scarring, and both my Fallopian tubes are open and working. BUT the MD reports that I have a lower than average egg count for a woman my age and my FMH (hormone) is high. She says my best chance at getting pregnant is by trying *right now.*\n\nI am pretty heartbroken that it may be **THESE circumstances** of my own body and age that may make the decision for me. I felt better to be able to *blame* my fencesitting/potential childfree status on the surgery.\n\nI know I don't want to be a 'single mother by choice' and my financial and social circumstances wouldn't necessarily be ideal for raising a baby right now via sperm donor. - even if it was possible to get pregnant. I don't want to be dating so seriously right now that I am assessing every Tinder date for current fatherhood status. The MD also said I wouldn't be a good candidate for egg freezing because they may not be able to extract enough viable ones for the $10k price tag to be worth it. But I just want more time before I go into early menopause. I don't feel ready for life to make this decision for me.\n\nI was hoping this medical workup would give me more answers to reduce my anxiety, but in fact, it has made the pressure so much worse.

Our RE gave us a good outlook for an IVF cycle and said I would probably react well to the meds. \n\nWe began stimming last week. Yesterday I had my first follicle scan after four days of stimming with 225IU menopur. However, not much had happened. Our doctor had to search for a while and found 2 good follicles and 4 small ones - 6 total. She was not sure whether the small ones would catch up. Also, she was very surprised and could not explain why my ovaries did not react to the menopur. She put me on 300IU menopur (highest dose she would prescribe) and told me to come back for another scan tomorrow. After the appointment I was devastated. The process is so expensive for us (insurance doesn't cover fertility treatment for lesbian/queer women here) and it is not clear if we will have a good number of follicles this time.\n\nWhat are your experiences? Can a higher dose still yield more follicles? How many follicles should we have for a realistic chance of pregnancy? Our RE's opinion is that you only need one, but I'm not that optimistic. Her argument is that I am still young, but right now it does not feel like that at all. Especially considering all the failed IUIs and the low number of follicles. My antral follicle count this cycle was approx. 9-10, so this is even lower. I asked several times in advance if we would need to run more tests, but the answer was no.

I have a call this Thursday to talk with my clinic about frozen embryo transfer protocols. \n\nHere is my dilemma: \n\nOutside of fertility/hormone treatments, I have a pretty regular cycle (28-32 days, 8-10 day periods, ovulation usually around cycle day 18-21).\n\nIn the past, when I have used birth control pills, unless I start them *after* my period has ended (which for me is usually cycle day nine or ten - yeah fun times), I either continue to spot and bleed and sometimes clot either straight through every single day until I have the full hormone withdrawal period (which happens on single phase oral contraceptives); *OR* I have a shortened initial period, then don\u2019t bleed for about a week, then spot and bleed from about cycle day 15 all the way through the end of my cycle/end of my regular withdrawal bleed (which happens on multiphasic oral contraceptives).  \n\nObviously, either of these patterns won\u2019t work for FET, since I\u2019ll be bleeding out my lighting the whole time on oral contraceptives, rather than building my lining with the estrogen and the oral contraceptives (which is what I understand is the point of oral contraceptives as part of an FET prep).\n\n#Has anyone experienced anything similar? \nIf so, what did you do to address it?\n\nMy RE clinic has the option of a Lupron start, but that seems pretty rough to me to go into basically false menopause for every FET.  Especially since: (1) I\u2019m so close to real menopause (age wise) that is a mindfuck I would like to avoid; (2) when my mom was going through menopause she had absolutely terrible side effects, which I feel like I would likely have as well, and I would obviously like to avoid; (3) my body seems very very sad on generating its own hormones, no matter what exogenous hormones are applied, so I think attempting to tamp them down with Lupron might just mess me up more. \n\nMy clinic also has the option of a \u201cnatural\u201d FET prep, but it will cost me more (significantly more than I already paid upfront for the otherwise - included FET prep), and it seems to me that they don\u2019t do it very often: they seem to be gently deterring me from doing a \u201cnatural\u201d FET prep. And, if they don\u2019t do it very often, I\u2019m not sure I want both of us flying blind.\n\nAny bright ideas? \n\nETA: I also crossposted in the daily, but then realized how long this thing is", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13599, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FET prep when you bleed through birth control pills but are scared of Lupron start?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562786091, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cb5dz9/fet_prep_when_you_bleed_through_birth_control/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "acheteur67", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5nfxz7h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562702261, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cb5ynr/im_afraid_its_to_good_to_be_true/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cb5ynr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1ae87cfc-92a6-11e4-8e5a-22000b26873e", "link_flair_text": "Treatment Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/cb5ynr/im_afraid_its_to_good_to_be_true/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1562702262, "score": 0, "selftext": "We tried for six years and suffered three miscarriages before we had our daughter.

Europe had the highest utilization (32.3%), followed by the USA and Canada combined at 29.1%. The leading indications for PGT-A were advanced maternal age (77%), followed by recurrent implantation failure (70%), unexplained pregnancy loss (65%), and sex determination (25%); 14% of respondents used PGT-A for all of their IVF cycles; 20% of IVF units reported transfers of chromosomally \u201cabnormal\u201d embryos, and 56% of these took place in the USA, followed by Asia in 20%. Remarkably, 106 (49.3%) cycles resulted in ongoing pregnancies (n = 50) or live births (n = 56). Miscarriages were rare (n = 20; 9.3%).\n\n***Conclusions***\n\nThe transfers of \u201cabnormal\u201d embryos by PGT-A offered robust pregnancy and live birth chances with low miscarriage rates. These data further strengthen the argument that PGT-A cannot reliably determine which embryos should or should not be transferred and leads to disposal of many normal embryos with excellent pregnancy potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I uploaded the file for those who have no access.*** Please be careful about your choice for PGS. It really isn\u2019t accurate and embryos do self correct. PGS \u201cnormals\u201d do miscarry. There is also a group on fb called  My perfect mosaic embryo ( I suggest you join if you have any PGS abnormal embryos or didn't get any normals in a cycle or just want to connect with others about info about PGS and its inaccuracy etc \u201c[https://www.facebook.com/groups/183880028992202/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/183880028992202/)\u201d where 5 ladies had live births of perfectly normal microarray babies from full aneuploid reported embryos (not mosaics). With plenty of mosaics being used with live births. As the study shows mosaics ALSO have a live birth rate of about 40-50% just like your average per transfer statistics. Depends on where the biopsy is done it can be inaccurate. The fact that there are plenty of live births from mosaics and aneuploid embryos\u00a0it will soon be fact that this can no longer be touted as some solution for all things IVF especially those with failures previously. There are a few cases where PGS may be pertinent due to abnormal chromosome loss prior, but it does NOT decrease miscarriage rates. That should not be a reason to do PGS especially in younger patients. Please do your research about what\u2019s happening on the current front of science and all this PGS research.\u00a0It has been proved over and over it does not decrease miscarriage. \n\n\u201cAnd, while some proponents of the procedure are still claiming that PGS/PGT-A reduces miscarriages \\[16\\], there has not been such a claim made for women with repeated miscarriages. A single study investigating PGS/PGT-A in such a population, indeed, did not reveal outcome advantages for PGS/PGT-A \\[17\\]. Further discussed below, the low mis- carriage rate observed in this survey in women who underwent transfers with \u201cabnormal\u201d embryos also argue against beneficial effects of PGS/PGT-A on miscarriages.\u201d\n\nALSO worth noting there are NO cases of abnormal babies born from abnormal embryos. As in the babies that have been born, have all had normal karyotypes. So the idea of \u201ctransferring abnormals will increase deformities and abnormal babies\u201d is simply not true.\u00a0\n\nIf you choose to PGS please also understand what you\u2019re choosing especially if you have low number of embryos. You have tho choose between potentially throwing away viable chances vs doing PGS. PGS normal embryos still miscarry and not take. This doesn\u2019t rule that possibility out. This is valuable info here for those who are on the fence and for those who this wouldn\u2019t be indicated ever in the first place. Don\u2019t let your clinics sell you this very profitable \u201csolution\u201d and know the risks.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully people start realizing that just because the THEORY behind something make sense, that doesn't actually mean that the actual result is going to be the expected result. ALL theories must be tested. The only way we can prove the \"PGS is accurate\" theory is transferring abnormals. And it's not looking good for the PGS theory, folks. Also I can't wait for results of the blind PGS study to come out where they are releasing the results after viable pregnancies / births of what the PGS results were. That is going to be the final straw to this theory IMO.\n\nFor your light reading tonight, download below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#The full article for those who have no access\u00a0\n\n[https://gofile.io/?c=2nkLy7](https://gofile.io/?c=2nkLy7)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13619, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Transfers of \u201cAbnormal\u201d embryos after PGT/A: clinics worldwide survey results (Mosaic and aneuploid)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562880790, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cbmstk/transfers_of_abnormal_embryos_after_pgta_clinics/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Singmethings", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "30 | single and TTC#1 | FET#1", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ou0ze", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562819095, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cbr84v/med_giveaway_austin_tx/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cbr84v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/cbr84v/med_giveaway_austin_tx/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1562819096, "score": 12, "selftext": "I'd prefer to give these to someone local but am willing to ship if no one local is interested.

Because it's reddit, which has a huge childfree population, I regularly see ridiculously rude comments about IVF.  Within the same week, I saw one poster post the birth of his baby through IVF and he got tons of upvoted comments lambasting him for not \"just adopting.\"  Then, another poster posted his baby that was conceived naturally and nobody asked him why he didn't just adopt.\n\nPersonally, I have a somewhat large social media following and when I opened up about my IVF, the most \"liked\" comments were calling me a selfish bitch and telling me to adopt- and not JUST adopt- but specifically adopt teenagers and kids with special needs (I'm 29 with zero parenting experience, so I'm sure I'd be a GREAT candidate for that.)\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with people?  If it's my duty to adopt a teenager, then isn't it also the duty of fertile people?  Or for that matter, childfree people?  I mean, isn't it \"SELFISH\" to spend all your money on yourself when you could be fostering 5 special needs teenagers??\n\nThese people are such hypocrites that even adopting isn't enough to satisfy them.  If you're infertile, you MUST adopt teenagers and older special needs kids, otherwise you're selfish.  If you're fertile, just go ahead and have kids, nobody cares.\n\nI honestly don't understand how anyone can justify this.  And as for the fake concern about IVF \"ruining my body,\" I'm literally fine.  I was bloated for like a week and then back to normal.  Pregnancy fucks with your body so much more than IVF does.  I wish people would stop acting like IVF is dipping yourself in radioactive waste.  \"Pumping your body full of hormones\" sounds so dramatic.  The needles are tiny and the hormones are ones your body already makes. You'd do more harm to your body by getting drunk.  \n\nUgh, sorry to rant like this but I get so mad thinking about this that I  want to punch people.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13633, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What is with childfree people who hate IVF with a burning passion?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562950093, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cbxyi1/what_is_with_childfree_people_who_hate_ivf_with_a/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562864797, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/cby6wd/thursday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cby6wd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 94, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/cby6wd/thursday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1562864798, "score": 13, "selftext": "Use this thread to share anything NOT necessarily related to infertility or treatment.

I pretty much assumed that I had a fatty liver since I'm diabetic, but I eat basically keto and have an excellent a1c (5.5) so I didn't expect an enlarged spleen too.  \n\n\nBackstory: diagnosed diabetic October 2016 with a1c 10.7 and BG 478.  By May of 2017 I had an a1c of 5.4.  I don't have baseline ultrasounds for liver and spleen from that time.  Husband and I got married in August of 2017, and have been trying to conceive since January 2018 with no success.  In May I was given several meds for weight loss that gave me abdominal pain and other problems features after losing 20 pounds in 20 days.  Discontinuing them and the abdominal pain went away.  My a1c crept up a bit, so I went low carb in January and started a bunch of supplements for pregnancy, and the abdominal pain returned.  It has been a steady low-grade abdominal pain since then.  In April we started medicated cycles of progesterone/letrozole.  And last week I finally got an abdominal ultrasound for the abdominal pain, when they diagnosed me with hepatosplenomegaly most likely secondary to fatty liver.

They said it was just a \"cute quirk\" and had no impact on fertility but that they would want to operate if it was more than 1.5cm.  So I didn't think much of it, especially since my uterus was the last thing on my mind after discovering we could only conceive with IVF and I wasn't sure if I'd even respond to meds!\n\nWell, now that we get closer to transfer I'm really worried about it.  My doctor did not seem concerned, and neither did the ultrasound tech.  However, I did some researching and I read that 60% of women with this issue have endometriosis (I have no other symptoms of endo, I've never even taken an advil during my period, which is actually relatively light) and the other 40% have fibroids or other \"pathologies.\"  Huh?  They made it sound like it was a common harmless variant, but this website made it seem like it's literally always indicative of a problem: https://www.drseckin.com/uterine-anomalies\n\nI'm also not sure how it can be unrelated to live birth rate if it's \"always\" indicative of a pathology.  Huh?\n\nThat website is from an endometriosis clinic, so obviously it's going to focus on the endo piece, but if you were me would you be worried about this?

The magic number needs to be equal to or greater than 25, mine was &lt;1. \n\nWorst part is, I tried so hard to be rational and keep a clear head about all of this, but I got too excited and now my heart feels torn up to shreds. I feel cheated by the universe. For 3 years I\u2019ve read \u201cNOT PREGNANT\u201d on tests and felt sad, but I moved on. I get this small spark of hope that our luck has changed, my husband excited to be a daddy, for it to really be too good to be true.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 13645, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "False Positive", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563027053, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ccbcc8/false_positive/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "domsbigASS", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_b4fa4hy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562944341, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/ccc3lg/question_about_iui_everyones_experience_with_iuis/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ccc3lg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/ccc3lg/question_about_iui_everyones_experience_with_iuis/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1562944343, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ok so say you have great sized follicles, and take your ovidrel.

Does that mean you didn\u2019t ovulate even though ovidrel is supposed to released those eggies? \n\nI\u2019ve asked my doc about why some practices use an ultrasound when inserting the IUI, and why some don\u2019t. The answer was that not everyone needs guidance in inserting the catheter to the uterus. But wouldn\u2019t it be great to know the size of the follicles with in minutes of the procedure too? And also take blood to make sure the hcg worked and the suggested ovulation day was correct? Or is that too many things to check, if they just checked that 2 days ago? \n\nThis is my 3rd IUI and I\u2019ve been through this all before, but other women have posted about their doctors doing more during the actually IUI. \n\nDo you ladies get blood and ultrasound when getting iuis?
