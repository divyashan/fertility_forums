About nine weeks later I was hospitalized and told I had an ectopic pregnancy. The doctors did surgery and removed my right Fallopian tube. It was a very traumatizing experience for me and it made me very sad for a long time.\nI decided to go to a fertility doctor to see what I was dealing with in terms of conceiving. At the time I was 25 years old and single, my boyfriend left me after my surgery because everything that happened \"freaked him out\". I went at this alone anyways because I had to know.\nThe doctor performed an HSG test, where they push dye into my uterus and up my remaining Fallopian tube to see any blockages. The results of the test are almost instantaneous, and he told me that my left tube was completely blocked all the way through. This was not good news.\nGoing back to my regular lady doctor, she told me that when she removed my right Fallopian tube, she noticed a lot of abnormal scarring in my uterus. I asked her what it was from and she said she didn't know. This frustrated me a bit. How could a doctor not know?! I didn't fight her about it though, and asked about my chances of getting pregnant in the future. She said I had no chance of natural pregnancy and my only shot was IVF, in vitro.\nI think about if I was born this way, if I did something wrong when it came to taking care of myself and my health, if I took the wrong birth control... I can tell you my mind can go on forever just wondering what happened. That isn't the point of this post, though.\nI would like to know if any mother out there has been through this. Have you conceived naturally and had a healthy pregnancy? What did you do to make that happen, or was it without help? I am very interested in hearing your stories.\nPlease forgive me, also, for any typos.

He does know, but he's still not beside me now. I don't know if this makes any sense.... I'm really not angry but I am so sad and lonely. I want to be off this road and able to experience being a parent and having a child to love and raise so badly! I can't just walk off this road though... It's not in my power.

I prefer to do the shots myself, so I know when it's coming. It helped to see my doctor do the first one, with a confident jab and none of the fretful lead-up my husband and I experienced with my trigger shots. \n\nHere's what I do:\n\n* Prepare the syringe.\n* Sit on a heating pad for about 5-10 minutes. During the last two minutes, rest the syringe on the heating pad to warm it a little.\n* Do the injection. I do the poking kind of quickly (my needles are size 22) and the pushing of the plunger slowly. In my experience, the Menopur and Ganirelix injections were way more uncomfortable -- I had a lot more stinging at the injection site and on the meds entering my body. **Edit:** /u/Rudysgoldfish asked about pulling the syringe out to check for blood. I do that when I remember. Although actually neither my doctor nor her IVF nurse ever have mentioned it. \n* Go back to the heating pad. Sit on it for about eight minutes. Then two minutes of ice. Then the heating pad for eight more minutes, and two minutes of ice. Then the heating pad again, and two minutes of ice. Top off with a minute of heat. Thirty minutes is  a long time to sit around, so I try to multitask. \n* I have never really massaged. I just move around. During the day I stand and walk around whenever I can, and at night I get up and do some stuff around the house.\n\nPersonally I have never had pain worse than I'd get with a tetanus or flu shot. \n\nI know some people have bad experiences, for which I am obviously sorry, but I wanted to post this because it's not that bad for everyone, and maybe I can spare someone the dread I felt leading up to it.

I have been reading lots of posts on various issues on this subreddit for several months now, and it has been very helpful in terms of information and just knowing that this community exists.\n\nMy husband and I have been TTC since October 2014, and I've been temping and timing things accordingly and we've had no positive tests. Due to some fairly consistent luteal phase spotting and an average luteal phase of around 11-12 days (although it can be as short as 9), we went to a fertility clinic. I've had the usual tests - sono, HSG, AMH, blood work, etc - and everything looks normal so far. \n\nHowever, we received my husband's SA results, and the figures do not look good. Volume was 6.5ml, count was 0.4M/ml, and motility was 25%. There is a comment on our report that the sample was not suitable for ASA and morphology due to low concentration. \n\nWhen my doc gave me the results, she said that we could covert my natural cycle monitoring to an IUI (which would include some sperm testing but not sure what that means exactly), but I knew enough that this didn't feel right.  Instead he will redo the test in a few weeks, including a DNA Fragmentation Index test. If the results come back just as low, then we get a referral for a urologist and see if there's anything they can find. \n\nFrom reading threads here, it sounds like ICSI IVF may be our only option.

We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way.\n\nYou feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience. Most people don't discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you -- as if you're defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own.\n\nIn today's open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn't distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope. \n\nWhen we started talking to our friends, we realized how frequently this happened -- that many people we knew had similar issues and that nearly all had healthy children after all. \n\nWe hope that sharing our experience will give more people the same hope we felt and will help more people feel comfortable sharing their stories as well.\n\nOur good news is that our pregnancy is now far enough along that the risk of loss is very low and we are very hopeful.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102276573729791&amp;set=a.529237706231.2034669.4&amp;type=1&amp;theater\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "We have something in common with Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3fczfc/we_have_something_in_common_with_mark_zuckerberg/"}, {"author": "TDPookie1", "author_created_utc": 1168689876, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "3 MCs pre-IVF; 7 PGS-tested frozen blasts; FET Sept'15", "author_fullname": "t2_y6f2", "created_utc": 1438396091, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3fd7co/an_ivf_laugh/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3fd7co", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3fd7co/an_ivf_laugh/", "retrieved_on": 1440576188, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "During my ER, when my husband went to a private room to do his \"collection,\" the song that randomly started playing on the radio as he walked into the room was Michael Jackson's \"Beat It.\" ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "An IVF laugh", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3fd7co/an_ivf_laugh/"}, {"author": "Fireangel16", "author_created_utc": 1303610497, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_54yj0", "created_utc": 1438401204, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3fdfvp/ivf_and_menopause/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3fdfvp", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3fdfvp/ivf_and_menopause/", "retrieved_on": 1440576078, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "This might be a stupid question or discussion, but it just popped in my head.

Now I guess my question/topic to discuss is running out of eggs depending on your age if you make 6-12 years worth of eggs during those 6 cycles and going through early menopause. At 32 years old, I would have about 10-15 years or so worth of eggs left. If I go through 6 cycles, I could theorically go into menopause as early as 37?

I have to say, I'm a tad disappointed, but I'm not sure if this is good or not. I'm currently on CD 12. My largest follicle is 14 mm, and then I have two others. I think one was around 10 or 12 mm, and the other was 8 mm. My Dr said my uterine lining was also a little thin. I'm set to trigger on Monday and hopefully will ovulate on Wednesday. \n\nI did have an unexpected change of events recently. I'm currently on my dad's insurance, which covers 6 IVF rounds in a lifetime. Unfortunately, that insurance will come to an end in January because his company will be switching insurance comapnies, so I talked to my Dr today, and we decided that we will go ahead with IVF if I don't get pregnant this month. He says we will be able to get at least one cycle in before the insurance changes, but that we will freeze any remaining eggs so the cost won't be as much if my new insurance doesn't cover IVF. So by at least October, after a few months of preparation, we will be starting our first round. \n\nMy Dr was amazing today. When I mentioned the issue with insurance, the first thing he said was that we would just go ahead with the IVF after this month. He also wants to have an initial consultation about it and says he has a big presentation he wants us to sit through so we know what will be going on. I have a friend who went to the same office I am going to but went to a different Dr. My Dr was the one who did the transfer for her IVF, and she got pregnant with her gorgeous son, so I feel I am in good hands. \n\nThanks for listening!

This cycle was supposed to be our first injectible/Bravelle-only cycle, where we're not doing anymore Femara or Clomid. My body has become resistant to the oral meds. On day 8 of it, my husband had to go to the ER for some severe pain and high fever. It turns out he had a severe infection, large abscess, and diverticulitis. It was completely out of the blue- he's a very healthy, fairly young guy. He's been in the hospital since Tuesday, and will probably be able to come home tomorrow. He will still need to be on antibiotics for another 3-4 weeks though, and had a PICC line placed to do that. \n\nNow that he is feeling much better and we know he's going to be just fine, I can let myself feel a little sad for this cycle. This was supposed to be our last cycle with this crazy clinic and I was excited for that, but now I'm tempted to do another cycle with them. Our plans to move have been postponed (probably- we'll find out more this week after he gets home... he's military) so we'll actually have a chance to do at least another cycle if we want to. \n\nI guess the high fever for so many days most likely killed off his sperm, from what I've been able to Google about it. My RE hasn't said anything about this and I don't expect her to address it unless I seriously push and call and call about it. Should he be tested or anything? I don't know if I've ovulated or not, or what my response was to the Bravelle that I did take- she said this cycle is scrapped and that she didn't need to see me for anymore testing, and just to call them when I get my period if we decide to do another cycle with them.\n\nAnyways, that's my update. It's not great, but it is what it is. He needs to rest and heal right now, and I'm okay with that, I just wish the timing of it all worked out a little better.

All were transferred, beta was negative.  \n\nMy RE has reached the conclusion that I am a poor responder to IVF, and although he is willing to try other protocols, it would not be a good use of my resources, as the odds are so low.  He strongly recommends that we move to Donor Eggs at this point.  He also believes I am perimenopausal, and should expect menopause int he next 5-10 years.  \n\nHow did all of my okay tests devolve into there being so little hope?\n\nHas anyone experienced low estrogen response, and what did you do about it?\n\nDid anyone have similar situations and dramatically better or different response to the Lupron micro-flare protocol (which is the one he said he would attempt next, if we wanted)?\n\nOther thoughts? Concerns?  Thank you.    \n\nETA: Spoke with my nurse, but the call got disconnected before I had asked all my questions.  She said that every test predicted a reasonable outcome for IVF, which is why they went ahead with it.  But the E2 progression, coupled with the low follicle count demonstrated that the initial tests were not telling the whole story.  She said that given and endless pool of money, we could keep doing this for low embryo yields.  One might work.  But they are assuming that I am not made of money, and that the cheapest, most guaranteed way for us to have a child is to use donor eggs.  Maybe I do need to consider a Shared risk program.  If they'll even take me.  Or just accept donor eggs.  I don't know.  I wish my body had failed completely instead of almost kind of worked.

You fine people are all my support group and I need to talk to someone who understands. I\u2019m not doing so well tonight.\n\nWe are MFI. Over the last year we had 1 round of IVF: 1 retrieval, 18 eggs, 11 fertilized, 4 embryos, 0 PGS tested. 3 failed FETs (1 leftover). Lots of crushed hopes and lots of emotional an physical discomfort for me. \n\nWe\u2019re starting IVF cycle #2 next week and I\u2019m a wreck. We took the summer off, hoping to feel rejuvenated once August rolled around, but I am starting to feel crazy, and I\u2019m not even on hormones yet! \n\nI told my husband tonight that I think I only have one more round in me and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m really not handling things well this time around. I'm sure that sounds stupid to those of you who've done many more rounds. \n\nHe didn\u2019t take that news well at all. I don\u2019t even know for sure if I mean it, but the way I feel tonight, I just want this part of our lives to be over. Even if that means being childless, I can\u2019t imagine another year of this hope/devastation roller coaster. \n\nThere are positives this time to focus on. We have a new doctor, will hopefully have new embryos, we\u2019re doing PGS this time. We feel encouraged.\n\nBut I just read about someone tonight who, even with PGS, still had three failed FETs with \u201cnormal\u201d embryos. Now it\u2019s all I can think about.\n\nI went out shopping with my mother in law last night. She was talking about the toys she\u2019s buying for my nieces and nephew. Then, out of the blue, she turned to me, literally grabbed me by the shoulders, shook me *playfully* and said, \u201churry up and have a daughter already so I can shower her with gifts! Ha ha.\u201d \n\nShe knows everything we\u2019re going through. And still\u2026 poor choice of words. As if I haven\u2019t done everything I can. I know she means well, but THAT is a perfect illustration of why I feel I can\u2019t talk to anyone I know. NO ONE gets it. Not a single person in my life. \n\nNot even my husband.  If he had his way, we\u2019d push through round after round until we had our own baby. I\u2019m not in the same place. I\u2019m fine with pursuing adoption or even\u2026. Given enough time and heartbreak\u2026 deciding to be childless. I just don\u2019t think I can do it much longer.\n\nIf there are any of you out there who have felt a similar desperation and have a happy ending to share, PLEASE tell me. I need anything right now. \n\nThank you so much for reading. I don\u2019t even know you, but knowing that you\u2019ve read this means so much to me right now. &amp;lt;3\n\nEdit: I actually had a lovely conversation with my MIL today and she really helped me out with processing some things. (Just didn't feel right to leave this post in a bad place with my MIL. We're all human and we all say stupid things from time to time, even though we mean well.)\n\nThanks to everyone for your posts.

I've had CD3 bloodwork done as well as having my GP check my thyroid, everything has been normal. I don't do very well with temping but it does seem that I ovulate normally. \n\nI started having some spotting before my period a few months after the D&amp;C, the length of time spotting increased each month until I hit about 8 days. That's 8 days of spotting followed by a 3-5 day period, followed by another 2-4 days of spotting. My doc started me on Clomid, I've done 2 cycles with pretty clear ovulation at days 18 and then 17. This last cycle she also started me on progesterone. None of this has so far affected the spotting. This current cycle I had 4 days of spotting, 5 days of bleeding, and am now on my 3rd day of spotting following my period. \n\nI decided not to take the Clomid this round for a number of reasons. My OB said we'd try 3 cycles before she sent me off to an RE.

But thanks in advance for letting me vent for a while.\n\nMy wife and I are having trouble conceiving. I'll try to spare some of the details, but it's been a few years, and we've been down more than a few roads to make it happen. So the last month has been only the most recent, but at the same time the most hopeful, as we waited for results from the latest process.\n\nIt's weird, how after we go see The Doc and take the latest round of chlomid or what have you, that we stop talking about it for a while. it's a collective holding of the breath, and we can't do anything but that. you can't talk about the hope, you can't talk about the \"maybe\". You can only sit and wait, talk about the house we're buying, talk about the day, or our weird neighbor, or our other awesome neighbors. Shit, when any given step has been taken, you can't really talk about the disappointment, because then you're just dwelling on it more.\n\nBut when my wife's mood changes after coming back in the room, with her response to my question being \"I started spotting\" (again) - man oh man is that a fucking gut-punch.\n\nAnd a gut-punch for me is fine. As much as I want kids in my family, I've always been fantastically talented at rolling through whatever shit-storm life puts me through. I'll make it fine, I've got my girl. But goddamn the hours spent holding my sobbing wife. Goddamn the silence in the house. Goddamn pouring her (us) another shot of whiskey the day after these miserable nights to help us not focus on the disappointment. Goddamn leaving her home to cry while I've got to go to work. Shit - Goddamn the fact that she's a fucking labor and delivery nurse and every fucking day has to see babies brought into this world, planned babies, mistake babies, traumatic babies, life-changing babies, babies destined for poverty and drug abuse and institutionalized lives. She see's so much in that fucking hospital. I can't imagine her internal conflict at the happy, intentional parents who leap with joy and titter with excitement at meeting their instantly loved child.\n\nBut we don't get that, apparently. \"Maybe next time.\" Right?\n\nI want to stop for a while. But we would both already be \"older\" parents, although there's still a few years left. But for years already it's been a snowball, this small, little pebble of \"why aren't we getting pregnant\" that rolled into a fucking avalanche of \"WE CAN'T FUCKING GET PREGNANT\".\n\nI don't know folks. It's tough.\n\nShit, then we can think about the fact that over the years we've had (at least) 3 sets of friends who were told in no uncertain terms that they couldn't have kids, and then, just so fucking magically, whatever powers that be decide that that these previously infertile couples get to have a rambunctious little diaper-filler all their own.\n\nAnd so we distance ourselves a little from our friends, for it, too. and I know that's a different thing, and our own doing, but man is it tough to watch our awesome friends bring up awesome little children who are going to be awesome people. Less dinner dates, less group outings, less group-family picnics. Because it's fucking tough.\n\nAnd fuck the neighbor's not-wife who is completely oblivious to the fact that \"When are you going to have children?\" and \"Don't you just want to be a mother?\" are fucking rude ass questions.\n\nAnyhow. I've got to go figure out a way to help my wife. Thanks for listening. Keep kicking ass out there.\n\nAddendum: I know this a sub \"for women's perspectives\", and my perspective is far from that.

It breaks down and, to keep this short and friendly, you have to get it out yourself. \n\nI've never tried the PIO and am curious about how many IU the injections are and when you are typically recommended to take them? I know they go in my gluteus maximus and I have read some posts here about how to make that more comfortable. I am not totally adverse to needles (I mean if I was, would I be here right now?) so thats OK but I am adverse to terrible needles. I don't mind the ones we used for stims. \n\nThose of you who have done either or both or have opinions (I love opinions) please do share them!

I don't want to waste money on an office visit just to be sent somewhere else.

Cancel the urologist and go straight to the RE?
