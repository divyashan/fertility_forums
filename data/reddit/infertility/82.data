I\u2019m new here. \n\nI feel very frustrated and alone. \n\nA little background about me. Husband and I have a considerable age difference. Before we got married he had a medical scare so we visited a fertility clinic to freeze his sperm. At that time I was also told I had PCOS. (No symptoms, no irregular periods, no weight or insulin issues, nothing that would indicate that I might even have PCOS). So the fertility doctor said I would need help if I wanted to get pregnant. \n\nI got pregnant about a year and half after we got married. I had a missed miscarriage at week 11. I was heartbroken. At the time I asked my regular gyno if I had PCOS, showed him my test results and he said no. I feel like he brushed me off, even though I know he is a very experienced and caring doctor.\n\nThe following year I got pregnant and it turned out be an ectopic pregnancy so I had to have a salpingectomy. That was truly devastating. I felt like a total failure. I lost a part of myself. \n\nMy husband and I didn\u2019t talk about trying again, except for \u201cif we try again we are going to make sure everything is perfect.\u201d Anyway, since then we neither been trying not preventing. With his age and my issues, I both felt like if we are going to try to conceive then we better do it as soon as possible to he\u2019s in his mid 50\u2019s now. \n\nFast forward to the last two months\u2014I have premenstrual spotting that lasts almost a week, then I start my period. It\u2019s been frustrating. (This happened once before a year or so ago and my Dr. prescribed Provera and my cycle normalized for awhile. I thought nothing of it and he made it seem like it was just a fluke).\n\nIt\u2019s come back again and so I told my gynecologist about  it during my routine pap which I strategically scheduled at the same time. I also asked him to test my androgen hormones because of some hair loss and excess hair, especially because of the fertility dr.\u2019s diagnosis from years ago. He decided to do a transvaginal ultrasound during that visit and saw a complex cyst and thickened endometrium. So he told me to come back after my next period. It just so happened that the spotting occurred two months in a row. \n\nOn my follow up visit he noticed the cyst was diminishing and no longer looked complex. He felt my endometrium was still thick for this part of my cycle and saw what he thought was a polyp. So he did a biopsy.\n\nI am really sad. Annoyed. Frustrated, and feeling like I will never have children. I feel pissed off because I don\u2019t know if my Dr. Is trying to minimize things...I mean do I look stupid or something? \n\nWhat if I have cancer? I mean, why is my reproductive system being a complete asshole to me? \n\nMeanwhile, my husband is just disappointed that we aren\u2019t going to have sex tonight, and here I am wondering if I need to freeze my eggs or prepare for bad news. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on with my body? My androgen hormones came back normal and within limits. Am I looking at endometriosis? Hyperplasia? Is this why I had those fertility issues before? \n\nUghhhhh!

Unexplained IF is our \"diagnosis\". SO sperm is amazing. All my labs are perfect, except slightly elevated testosterone. We are a year in on TI with follistim and trigger. We are hesitant on IUI as it failed in the past and RE doesn't see any reason to do one as it would only very slightly increase chance of success. Previously we were ttc 2 years with treatment and had success, but our son was stillborn at 40 weeks last May.  \n\nJust got confirmation today that our current cycle was a failure. When I went in for baseline on CD4 of this cycle my lining was still at 7.5 and then was 7.8 at CD9. CD 12 was 9.5ish. I had a somewhat medium to heavy flow from day 1-3 and then just spotting until day 6. Typically when I go in at day 3 or 4 my lining is anywhere between 3-4, maybe 5. I spoke with my RE a few months ago about having a d&amp;c (if that's even what it is) to \"clear\" everything out because I was concerned that there is old lining left over that could be causing some kind of implantation issue. At the time she thought it could be something to look into, but down the road since all my previous cycles had thinner lining at baseline. \n\nHas anyone had this done strictly for this reason? Is there a point to it? I'm just trying to think of anything else I/we can do that is/may be covered by insurance because IVF is not really an option at this point because we just bought a house. \n\nTIA and sorry for any rambling or confusion.

I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going with this post. \n\nWe had a horrible first IVF cycle. I got 19 eggs that lead to only one blastocyst. \n\nOf course, they put the blastocyst back in. 5 days later I got a very faint positive pregnancy test. I\u2019ve never seen a positive test before so honestly I just shrugged it off and didn\u2019t believe it. \n\n2 days later I took another. Much darker this time. Still shrugged it off as I didn\u2019t believe we were lucky enough. \n\n1 day later. Took a clear blue digital. It popped up with \u201cpregnant! 2-3 weeks\u201d \n\nI called my clinic who advised me to test again in a few days. They don\u2019t do Betas to confirm pregnancy. Only a home pregnancy test and then a scan at 6 weeks.\n\nAt some point I then began noticing my pregnancy tests lines were not progressing. I think all infertile women are guilty of taking multiple tests and that\u2019s what I was doing. I was reassured constantly that it was because I was doing them at different times of day. I\u2019m not stupid. My urine wasn\u2019t diluted at all. The lines were fading. \n\nThis morning I began bleeding. I was luckily seeing my psychologist at the clinic anyway so I told the clinic. They told me I have to wait 3-4 months to start my second round of IVF for my HCG to go to zero. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s already headed to Zero, you morons (sorry, I\u2019m just heartbroken) pretty sure it won\u2019t take 4 months though!! I don\u2019t get \u2018cycles\u2019 anyways. I don\u2019t ovulate or have periods.\n\nAbout 2 days ago I had also noted that my cervix was low and open. I\u2019m pretty sure that ain\u2019t what cervix\u2019s do when pregnant. I was destined to lose that embryo. \n\nMy psychologist wasn\u2019t overly comforting. Her response to all this was \u201cwell at least it proves you can get pregnant!! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d What?? It proves nothing of the sort \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nSo thats it. My first IVF cycle has ended as quickly as it started. I feel so done.

Are RE prescribing probiotics as part of protocols now? Thoughts?\n\nI discussed the supplements that I was taking along with any changes to our protocol that could increase our chances. I listed off all the supplements I was taking and my RE said, *if you really want to take anything, I would recommend probiotics.* I asked her why and she said there was really interesting emerging science on the benefits of certain bacterial flora in the uterus and vagina, in relation to pregnancy outcomes.\n\n**Hold the bus.** In my several years of being on this site, I don't recall probiotics being discussed regularly. Therefore, research time.\n\nHere is what I came up with:\n\n* [Relationship of Vaginal Bacteria and Inflammation With Conception and Early Pregnancy Loss Following In-Vitro Fertilization](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/idog/2003/545298/abs/) - small study from 2002 showing a positive relationship between lactobacillus and pregnancy rates/live births.\n\n* [Examination of bacterial contamination at the time of embryo transfer, and its impact on the IVF/pregnancy outcome](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-007-9146-5) - study from 2007 showing decreased pregnancy rates in women who test positive for certain bacteria.\n\n* [Microorganisms within Human Follicular Fluid: Effects on IVF](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059062) - study from 2013. Tons of info but my take away was Lactobacilli was associated with positive pregnancy rates.\n\n* [Does intravaginal probiotic supplementation increase the pregnancy rate in IVF\u2013embryo transfer cycles?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648310613016) - study from 2005. Long story short, the findings are that no, supplementation vaginally with a probiotic after retrieval does not increase positive pregnancy outcomes. This study doesn't look at supplementation prior to retrieval.\n\n[Evidence that the endometrial microbiota has an effect on implantation success or failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937816307827)\n\n[Igenomix is also currently sponsoring a study assessing uterine microbiome and receptivity from fluid](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03330444?cond=Uterine+microbiome&amp;rank=1)\n\nSo? Thoughts? Has your RE ever mentioned this?\n\n[I bought this one](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B00JEKYNZA/ref=mp_s_a_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510781267&amp;sr=8-9&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;keywords=probiotics) on a recommendation from another lady here who had done research into the probiotics. Obviously talk to your RE if you are concerned about starting anything new.\n\n[Link to thread from a year ago with some interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/7d4z0q/discussion_probiotics_and_ivf_outcomes/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14384, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Probiotics &amp; IVF outcomes", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567915186, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d0rbs3/probiotics_ivf_outcomes/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567850872, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d0u8pj/saturday_am_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d0u8pj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 110, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/d0u8pj/saturday_am_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1567850873, "score": 12, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!\n\nUse this thread to share things that are NOT specific to treatment.

The retrieval was relatively successful (10 eggs) but afterwards I experienced a significant uptick in uterine pain and endometriosis-like symptoms that I hadn't experienced in almost 10 years (I had VERY bad periods in high school, but after getting on the pill in college, things seemed to even out and from 27 on I didn't use the pill and didn't need to.) \n\nThis May, we did our first of 3 rounds of medicated (Letrozole) IUI. My first round, I noticed some weird changes, like a sense of bladder urgency and pressure, as well as mood/emotion changes. The second round I didn't see much of that at all, and round 3 it was all back.\n\nWe tried to go for round 4 but discovered I have ovulated before the day 12 ultrasound. My doctor recommended doing an unmedicated IUI next since the medicated one was causing side effects and I still only ever had 1 follicle.\n\nWe had planned on jumping back in at the next cycle, but THAT cycle started about a week early, which I attributed to the early ovulation. It put us at needing to do IUI stuff during a time we had to travel, so we put it off to this month.\n\nWell now I'm 18 days into this cycle and it looks like my period is starting AGAIN. My periods have historically been pretty long (30-32 days) so 2 months in a row of these shorter cycles has me freaked out. I'm wondering if I'm going through perimenopause; I'm wondering if the egg retrieval/Letrozole kicked off perimenopause, I'm wondering if the hormones from the egg retrieval and IUI are mimicking perimenopause but isn't actually perimenopause....\n\nBasically, I'm panicking that my previously somewhat stable fertility is about to go completely down the tubes in a matter of months and that I did something to cause it. Does anyone know any science around this? Can fertility treatments cause of mimic these kinds of symptoms?\n\nI'm really scared. Any advice would be appreciated. \n\n(And I'm reaching out to my doctor tomorrow).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14392, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Perimenopausal Effects of Egg Retrieval/Medicated IUI?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568074959, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d1jbwc/perimenopausal_effects_of_egg_retrievalmedicated/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hellokitty87", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4i6n5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567990194, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d1jn6x/meds_donation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1jn6x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/d1jn6x/meds_donation/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1567990196, "score": 10, "selftext": "I have 6 boxes of ganirelix and 1 vial HCG diluted with 5cc bacteriostatic water on 8/30/19, preference for Chicago area but if u need it u need it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14390, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Meds donation", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568076581, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d1jn6x/meds_donation/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bakeoffbabe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "d70f54ce-930e-11e4-8710-22000b26873e", "author_flair_text": "39F/1mc/2 ERs/2 years deep/ugh", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2j2w127k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567998371, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d1l74w/to_rpl_or_too_early/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1l74w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1ae87cfc-92a6-11e4-8e5a-22000b26873e", "link_flair_text": "Treatment Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/d1l74w/to_rpl_or_too_early/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1567998379, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure where to post exactly, so please excuse the standalone.

My RE, god love her, seemed open but as always, skeptical.

I should mention before my story begins that I am in my early 20s, and I have been trying to get pregnant for about a year now... obviously to no avail. I\u2019m starting to believe that maybe I\u2019m just not meant to be a mother, and it\u2019s damn depressing. I\u2019ve gone through the fertility clinics, I\u2019ve taken all the medication, and I\u2019ve done the IUI... unfortunately IVF is $10,000 per try, and insurance refuses to cover it. I\u2019ve lost the weight, I\u2019ve gotten healthier, and yet still no baby. My heart breaks every time I see little ones, and I\u2019ve become jealous of pregnant women who walk by me in the malls or down the street. I don\u2019t like the way I feel, but it\u2019s almost as though I can\u2019t help it. I was pregnant once, when I was a teenager and I wound up miscarrying at around 4 months. No rhyme or reason, just...gone. Both my fertility and OB/GYN doctors say that my miscarriage was most likely the catalyst for my fertility problems now. \n\nMy mother had trouble conceiving me, however it\u2019s though she forgot the pain and discouragement that she felt when she was trying. For example: I\u2019ll try to talk to her about it, and she\u2019ll just tell me that I\u2019m just being dramatic, or that maybe life is telling me that I shouldn\u2019t be a parent. Because of all of this, my depression has decided to come back; and make matters worse. I\u2019ve started fertility and general counselling again (at $150 per hour), and it\u2019s helping a little bit, but I think that making progress (any progress) in my fertility problems would have a larger and more positive impact at this point. \n\nAnyone else dealing with stuff like this?

But it is still hard knowing I want a baby and I will have to continue on my own.\n\nAny-who, I posted about my infertility on my social media page back in April. I wanted to share my story because I knew there had to be other women like me out there. It was amazing to see four people send me a private message saying they **were** struggling with or **currently are** struggling with the same thing. \n\nOn that note , I also got a few messages where, I swear, people did NOT think before pushing send. \n\nThis made me think about all the cringe/stupid things people have said to me before and after finding out about my infertility. Anyone have any they want to share?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Just adopt! There are plenty of kids out there who need a family!\n* Happy Mother's Day! If you are one!\n* I mean, he is putting it in the right hole, right? (followed by LOL)\n   * I no longer talk to this person.\n*  Oh, but at least it's fun trying right?! (stupid wink)\n* Just relax! It will happen! Open up a bottle of wine and put on some sexy tunes.\n* Oh, what a lovely home! And plenty of extra rooms for your kids! How many do you have? \n   * Followed by: Oh, you don't have any? When do you plan on starting a family?\n* You're young! You have all the time in the world!\n* It's easy! I got pregnant WHILE on birth control. \n* Oh, sorry to hear that. It's OKAY! Kids aren't all they are cracked up to be. (followed by an awkward chortle)\n* Trust me, you  just lose a lot of sleep with a baby anyway! (again awkward chortle)\n* Trust me, you don't want this (LOL, points to her own baby bump)\n* Oh, it's meant to be this way! Trust me!  (said my relative juggling a 2 year old son and 2 new twin daughters)\n* Do you feel like, you know, less feminine?\n* PLEASE JUST TAKE MY KIDS!! (again, LOL)\n* Maybe you should get a dog! I'm a happy single dog momma.\n* Just try IVF! \n* If you stop being so down about it, it'll happen!\n*  Maybe you need to lose some weight first. That's all it'll take! (as I sit there cursing my PCOS ladden body)\n\nI know that discussing infertility can make some people uncomfortable. Hell, I didn't know much about it until I was going through it myself. But damn. I just thought some people would just realize the words coming out of their mouth are...not okay.\n\nTo wrap up, I just wanted to say I have been following this page and reading posts for a long time. My heart goes out to all of you struggling with infertility. I have found much peace and supportive with your words even if I was remaining silent.

I have a question I think this group would  be especially equipment to give opinions about. \n\nI lost a fallopian tube and a pregnancy about a year and a half ago. I have had my last 4 cycles monitored via ultrasound, and each time it was on the tubeless left side. I've done some checking around, and it seems fairly common to have a \"boss\" ovary, which unfortunately seems to be the one with a very low likelihood of getting my egg to my uterus. (The chances are somewhere from 15-30%).\n\nThe only treatment that doesn't involve crossing our fingers and waiting a few more years seems to be stimming to force the lazy ovary to make an egg/eggs in addition to the boss ovary.\n\nMy question is this: if I'm already paying for the meds, sticking myself daily, and going in for monitoring every day, should I just have ivf? It is a lot more expensive, but we could manage (but I don't think I could manage those appointments month after month). I have heard from a lot of women on Reddit that the retrieval and transfers aren't too terrible and I've heard a lot of horror stories about the drugs. I had an ultrasound mid follicular stage in my cycle last month and had around 9 competing folicules, so my uneducated guess is I would make a decent number of mature eggs on stims.

This may be pretty long but I feel horrendous. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read my previous posts, you\u2019ll know I had an early miscarriage and lost our only blastocyst in the process. No baby. None on ice. Nothing to show for all the money spent on meds and the work I put in to grow all the eggs I had. \n\nI did not mention this in my previous post, but after we announced to very close family that I\u2019d had a positive pregnancy test, my sister in laws who are lesbians decided to go and get a frozen embryo transfer the exact same week I got the positive test. They already have a little girl who they struggle to cope with and constantly complain about. The moment I got those two pink lines, they shot down to their fertility clinic and decided to get another one of their many high quality blastocysts put back in. I am fully under the impression they did this on purpose. Their child is 5 years old. They\u2019ve had 5 years to use another blastocyst but only decided to do it when we got pregnant? Long story short, she got a positive pregnancy test today from that transfer. I\u2019ve never screamed as loudly in my life as I did when I received the text saying this. Never. I\u2019m devastated. I can\u2019t move from my bed. I think I\u2019m going to die. \nTheir baby is due in June if all goes well with the pregnancy. Our baby was due May. \n\nI keep watching miscarriage experience videos over and over again on YouTube just to remind myself that I\u2019m not alone, but these women aren\u2019t the same as me. Mostly anyway.\n90% of them aren\u2019t infertile and never have been. 90% of them already have kids and this was their second or third pregnancy, sometimes even fourth. At least they have something left to live for after their miscarriages. What do I have? I\u2019ve got to start a second IVF cycle when I feel mentally ready to do so. I have nothing left. \n\nI feel horribly offensive saying the above, because any miscarriage is devastating but I almost feel I have more reason to cry and complain than a woman who already has four kids and has had a miscarriage and no infertility issues. She has reason to get her ass out of bed every morning. I have nothing left now. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be a mom. \n\nMy life feels over. I\u2019ve cried all day. I think my sister in laws news has really made it hit home to me that yes, I\u2019ve lost our baby and only blastocyst. I feel I have no right to complain though because I was only 4 weeks pregnant. \n\nI feel so alone. Even if I\u2019m not alone I feel alone. I\u2019m honestly considering checking myself into a mental hospital as I\u2019m definitely at risk of harming myself. My sister in laws can go fuck themselves. They had this perfect idea in their stupid heads that we\u2019d both carry our babies at the same time and the kids would grow up close in age and it\u2019d all be picture perfect. Even if this pregnancy fails for them, they have 5 grade 1 blastocysts on ice. I\u2019ve got nothing. I\u2019ve got nothing left. What do I do and where do I turn? \n\nMy husbands reaction has been enough for me to consider packing my bags and leaving for a few weeks or months. I wanted him to scream and be angry too at his sister for getting an embryo transfer to try and catch up with us, but he was casual about it and basically just said it was annoying and \u2018wrong\u2019 of them but there\u2019s nothing he can do. Yes he\u2019s right but I so want someone to feel as fucking angry as I do. \n\nHis response to the miscarriage has been just as lacklustre. He told me that when we move on to our second prepaid cycle he\u2019s hopeful we will have more embryos to freeze and bank so maybe it\u2019s a blessing this cycle didn\u2019t work. We\u2019re part of a prepaid 3 cycle shared risk program that ends when you have a \u2018live birth\u2019 so if that baby had survived we wouldn\u2019t have gotten any refund element or had any further cycles to use up. \n\nIf human life is so hard to create and so delicate, why are there so many of us? And I keep asking myself how the world is carrying on, when mine is breaking apart. I keep asking myself how my husband can sleep so soundly next to me at night, whilst I lay awake crying and typing things like this out. I keep asking myself, how he can walk about as normally.\n\nIn a few weeks time, maybe a few months, this man will hold my hand again and stroke my hair as I writher in pain in the egg retrieval room all over again, the horribly dull, deep ache of having your eggs pulled out of you whilst you\u2019re not sedated at all, and beg for more gas and air. He\u2019ll cheer me on each time they pull an egg and our brief optimism may restart. I\u2019ll come out of the operating room but I won\u2019t be as hopeful as I was the first time that I came out. I won\u2019t crack as many jokes to my husband or nurses. I won\u2019t care when they tell me how many eggs they got this time. My heart may not even bang as hard when I see the clinic are calling me to tell me how many have fertilised, because I\u2019ll never expect anything good from IVF ever again after this cycle. After the realisation of what IVF really is. \n\nThrough all this, I\u2019m partially grateful I got to see my first ever positive pregnancy test. Even if it wasn\u2019t a true positive. Because for just a day or so I believed I was having the love of my life\u2019s baby. I got to clutch the test in my hand and marvel over the faint faint line. I got to think to myself \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worked. This is amazing. How are we so lucky?\u201d For nearly 3 years, I\u2019ve never owned a positive pregnancy test. I\u2019ve never even seen one. I got chance to see one this time. It was there. Something was there, albeit not to be. \n\n\nMy first cycle ended as quickly as it began. I don\u2019t know how much more I could go through this. I thought I was depressed before my first IVF cycle, but now I know what depression really is. Pure desperation and an inability to even get out of bed. I want to be held like a crying toddler, but at the same time I want to be left alone to mourn in peace.\nWhy me?

I need to get this out. Maybe it\u2019s better suited for IFchildfree, but I need to hear from people still in the trenches. \n\nYesterday, my husband and I talked more about ending treatment for good. I don\u2019t share most of my thoughts, emotions, dreams, and fears with people I know. But lately I\u2019ve been opening up more to my husband. It\u2019s good for our marriage regardless of whether kids come along, and I\u2019ve been more comfortable doing that in large part because of this process. So I mentioned that instead of working another 10 years and retiring early, I could instead pursue some not super-lucrative ideas sooner since we wouldn\u2019t be as concerned with saving for things like college funds. He gave me a skeptical look and asked for specifics. They involved writing, and he picked up on that because he knows I love it and I\u2019ve tried (albeit half heartedly) to pursue it without success. Indeed, one is an intensely personal project that other family members are only now starting to show interest in. \n\nThen he said, \u201cThe time for chasing dreams has passed.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always loved writing. I\u2019ve always been good at writing. I\u2019ve always wanted to be some kind of writer. I studied journalism, I interned in publishing, I became a lawyer. During the worst of my depression, my cousin suggested I write out my thoughts because, as she said, you like to write and you\u2019re a good writer. A federal magistrate judge once told one of my supervisors that I had given the best closing argument he\u2019d ever heard. Maybe he said that to others as well, but I knew - I KNEW - that my greatest strength was telling the jury a compelling story and keeping their attention the whole time. I can\u2019t do much else in life, but I can string together some words and add impressive alliteration. I\u2019ve made so many excuses over the years for why I can\u2019t be a writer, or why I can\u2019t make the time or effort. \n\nMy partner in life, the one person who is supposed to have my back, just shit all over the one big dream I had left. And when this guy shits, you notice. \n\nAnd he does this. He does this all the time. Admittedly, sometimes it\u2019s for the better. I have a lot of wild, naive ideas, and he\u2019s a hardened, pessimistic realist. But he\u2019s also depressed. And in spite of all I\u2019ve experienced - so many life setbacks and my own depression - I still have so many ideas because I\u2019m not just wild and naive. I\u2019m optimistic. I can\u2019t help myself. I look at everyone else who\u2019s happy, people who deserve it, people who don\u2019t deserve it, and like Mindy Kaling, I ask myself: \u201cWhy not me?\u201d\n\nI was driving to work from my ERA baseline this morning, and I realized that 9/11 happened 18 years ago. That means that 18 years ago, I was a college freshman in New York, ambitious and excited to become a foreign correspondent or documentary filmmaker or profile writer. Over 18 years - an entire childhood\u2019s worth of time - I\u2019ve scribbled down scenes and poems, hoarded interesting facts and observations and newspaper articles to weave into plots, taken notes after I wake up from a weird dream to turn it into a story, and made up character names without knowing where they would end up. Those notes are in academic planners stuffed in a large plastic box, and saved in Word documents, and scattered in my Apple Notes. The story drafts are written in pencil in spiral notebooks, the writing in places smudged so much that I involuntarily squint to make out the text. They are typed on 20-year-old printer paper in Courier New font, from a Dell desktop I both loved and despised. They play out like movie or TV scenes in my head. They have soundtracks I burned onto CDs in college or created with Pandora. They\u2019re the voices in my head. \n\nI wanted to be a parent. I wanted to have those magical holiday moments around the Christmas tree, those backyard summer dinners after picking homegrown vegetables, those first days of school, those music recitals, those soccer games, those trips to the library. And yet those things never pressed on me for so many years like the urge to be a writer. Throughout this process, I\u2019ve consoled myself, kept myself from drowning in grief, by reminding myself that even without kids, I still have something to do. Something to pursue. Something to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. It\u2019s not video games or a new YouTube video. It\u2019s not the work I do in my cubicle. It\u2019s not an annual trip to a Disney World. It\u2019s not watering my plants. It\u2019s not renovating the house. If I take this other path, I need something to move towards in the future so that I don\u2019t Michael Corleone back into treatment and despair. \n\nI\u2019m meeting with a younger lawyer tonight to mentor her, and my husband is excited about it. He reminded me to be the mentor I always wanted. What am I supposed to tell her after last night?\n\nI may not have kids, so that leaves me free to chase other dreams. But if the time for chasing dreams has passed, what remains? What else is there?\n\nWe put ourselves through this because we\u2019re not supposed to give up on our dreams. But we can\u2019t have another dream? Or we can\u2019t Lazarus an old dream? I thought anything was possible. He said we were a power couple. He said we would conquer the world. I guess he meant just a video game world. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more I want to tell him and anyone else who shits on my wild hopes: Fuck you. Fuck your pessimism. Fuck your depression. Fuck your lack of dreams. I have been through too fucking much to roll over and die like an old banana that will never be banana bread. If you don\u2019t want to come with me while I chase this sparkle-hearted unicorn fantasy, then I will drop you like a bag of dirt. It\u2019s been 18 fucking years. Half my life so far. My dream is now an adult and old enough to vote and buy porn. If I fall on my ass, that\u2019s on me. But it\u2019s my ass, and I\u2019m tired of stabbing it with giant needles.  \n\nOr maybe that\u2019s just the Lupron talking.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "subreddit_subscribers": 14426, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why not me?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568307541, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d2taks/why_not_me/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568222446, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/d2tmia/wednesday_pm_chat_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d2tmia", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "Scheduled", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 81, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/d2tmia/wednesday_pm_chat_thread/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1568222452, "score": 12, "selftext": "If you have questions or updates on treatment, consider the Daily Treatment thread instead!\n\nUse this thread to share things that are NOT specific to treatment.

Hoping this can help others with their WTF convos if they find themselves in a similar situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Diagnosis:** Husband \\- MFI, 0% morphology, low to normal motility and count. Me - Had small likely endometrioma that went away during 2 week birth control suppression, organs still \"fluid\", no lap to officially diagnose. Low AMH (0.9 ng/mL) but normal FSH (2.5 mIU/mL) and antral follicle count of 19. RE considers my ovarian reserve to be within the expected range for my age (32ish).\n\n**Protocol**: Antagonist (gonal F, menopur) + ICSI\n\n**Outcomes and** ***next steps*****:**\n\n* Low egg retrieval rate and number - 6 eggs from 14+ follicles in right size range. Maturity rate of eggs retrieved was normal - 5 mature of 6 retrieved\n   * *Doc confirmed this is unexpected and potentially a trigger issue. Changed my trigger from Ovidrel to 10K HCG trigger for next cycle.* \n   * *Increasing stim doses (menopur is x3 previous cycle) as if fertilization rate is a % gamble, more = more chances. RE believes this may also help with overall maturity issue, assuming the follicles with no eggs were due to immaturity*\n   * *Also skipping birth control surpression to try to increase total retrieval #*\n* Low fertilization rate: 1 of 5 mature fertilized. \n   * *Embryologist report did not indicate that the mature eggs retrieved had any \"fragility\" issues (based on appearance at retrieval and description of ones not fertilized)*\n   * *No obvious reason for this low of fertilization, it could be either sperm or egg or both*\n   * *Switching from ICSI to PICSI to optimize for better sperm quality*\n* 1 3 day embryo (7 cell, medium grade) transferred resulting in chemical pregnancy at 5.5 weeks. I had multiple days of bleeding including what seemed like \"full flow\" throughout the process. *RE confirmed growth of 3 day embryo was normal, which means normal growth is feasible for us. Also took CP as a relatively good sign as it gives more info to work with. Unfortunately pregnancy ended too early to be able to tell if implantation issue or embryo issue.*\n* Progesterone - apparently was lower than expected at my last blood draw to test out my CP. *RE switching me to PIO which can help keep progesterone at appropriate levels. May also help with bleeding issue mentioned in previous bullet*\n\n**Other notes**:\n\n* Husband started taking FertilAid supplement around July, so hopefully we see some improvement in sperm health for next cycle\n* I'm starting to take Co-Q10 again to see if that helps. I had tried before but it gave me bad GI issues. I just bought a new brand.\n* I asked about regular fertilization followed by rescue ICSI but RE didn't think the ICSI procedure itself was contributing to low fertilization rate based on the egg reports\n* I asked about switching to other protocols but RE thought increasing here may be better as a first step\n* RE not concerned about endo as cyst was small and went away, and most endo treatments overlap with IVF treatments. RE only recommends follow up on endo in case of multiple large cysts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope my essay helps someone. No idea what impact these changes will have on my cycle in reality, but am slightly more hopeful again.

I\u2019ve lurked here for a while and made a few one off posts, but I guess I should get around to introducing myself. \n\nI was diagnosed with unexplained infertility/maybe one blocked Fallopian tube a few months ago. I like camping, hanging out with my dog, and knitting. I\u2019m also working on going back to school to enter the medical field m. Although, I must say...nothing feels as important in my life since this whole shitty infertility journey. My partner and I decided to do four rounds of IUI with letrozole and then move to IVF. We\u2019re now on our \u201cfinal\u201d IUI round after previous cycles that weren\u2019t successful. \n\nThe previous IUIs, my uterine lining has been less than 5mm on trigger day. Not great, or just in my head? This time around, I asked about possible modifications to our protocol since my lining has been so thin. I\u2019ve gotten the runaround from my RE\u2019s office (mostly in the form of people saying they\u2019d ask the doctor) and frankly don\u2019t know what to do\u2014at this point it\u2019s CD3 and I haven\u2019t actually talked to to the doctor. I\u2019ve been told that my follicles need to produce their own estrogen to thicken the lining and that there\u2019s nothing they can do.

He and his wife bingoed me on Mother's Day with their pregnancy announcement while I was alone  living in another country I had just recently moved to while my husband stayed in the US (where my family is from) for work. It was one of the most emotionally bruising things I have gone through, for reasons which I love that I don't have to explain here. My best friend is also due at the same time. She and her partner had to do IVF and though their IVF experience was relatively easy, the kinship of having to struggle and the fact that it's my best friend makes me feel all warm and gooey about their about-to-be-kid. I feel like I will be warm and gooey about my brother's kid, at some point, but I am not feeling at all gooey towards him and his wife rn. It will be the first child born to any of us four siblings. \n\nI am currently still abroad, but I've moved countries to one that is further away and more expensive to return home from. I am not sure, given my currently salary and work conditions, if it is a financially or professionally good decision to come home in December for the newborns, but I want to bracket those concerns for now. \n\nThe etiquette question: I am someone with limited social awareness (like when my husband and I were dating, for instance, he'd be like 'what's the proper way to dress for X family occasion' and I'd always get the answer slightly wrong). I can be in my head a little bit. Do people fly across the country to see their siblings' newborns? Do they fly across the ocean?\n\nThe infertile person question: Do I have to fly home in December to see the babies shortly after birth (when I feel like my emotions will be even more raw)?

It doesn\u2019t matter much because I never get as many eggs as my AFC, so I ultimately get pretty average results from my retrievals, but it has me wondering...why?\n\nIs it that AMH just isn\u2019t as accurate for women my age, something else, random body variations, or could these discordant values be an issue later on with transfers?
