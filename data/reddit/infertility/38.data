I say I've got pretty sensitive skin, so if it was like an adhesive from tape or something and they peeled it off and I was red it was no biggie. She said no, it wasn't from adhesive, it was just her and the doctor's hands pushing on me. \n\nSo I peek and yeah, it's red, but whatever, I'm still pretty drugged. Then the doctor comes out and says, yay, we were expecting 7 and got 7, but we had to be pretty rough, so you might be a little sore and red. I peek again and shrug it off. \n\nThe next morning rolls around and I get a shock when I look in the mirror. My stomach has abrasions that were now scabbing over and were pretty painful. Like, this isn't just red marks, this needs neosporin and cannot be touched by pants or it HURTS. Like a skinned knee but right near my belly button and much bigger. \n\nThinking about the amount of force that someone's bare (ok, gloved) hands would have to be on me to do this kind of damage is kind of crazy to think about. \n\nSo yeah, my insides feel a little like I've had an RC car driving around in there too.\n\nAnyone else experience anything like this?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "All banged up from egg retrieval.

She's probably ten years older but we have a lot in common; she has/had sever endo and had trouble falling pregnant with her daughter but ended up conceiving naturally and it came up in conversation that I'm going through my own stuff. Every time I go in she asks how it's going and what my treatments are like and I happily chat with her about it, because I don't meet many women who can relate and its kind of nice to share our experiences. I feel the need to mention this part because it might explain why she felt like we could speak as frankly as she did.\n\nA couple months ago during my last appointment she was asking a bunch of questions about IVF. It came to the question about how many embryos I was going to implant vs. freeze and what my plans were for the remaining embryos which we would never end up using. Knowing she's full blown catholic, I delicately tried to explain to her that I wasn't religious and didn't believe that it was causing harm to my unborn embryos or their potential souls to be frozen indefinitely or destroyed. I said I absolutely don't want twins so I'll take the chance that the procedure doesn't work over the potential to resent the existence of one of my own children. \n\nThe conversation deteriorates into her unleashing a diatribe about everything from religion to welfare to Donald Trump, abortion, adoption, you name it. Everything your mother always told you to avoid in mixed company, we're talking about it now. ALL OF THIS WHILE I'M ON MY KNEES WITH MY BARE ASS HANGING OUT AND HER RIPPING OUT MY PUBES!\n\nDon't get me wrong, much of what she had to say I could understand and even agree with and I felt like I kept up with the conversation just fine. We have a lot of similar viewpoints about the state of affairs in the world, and she really is a nice lady. Now, I don't know if it was just my own perception or what, but it felt like she started getting aggro about the embryo thing specifically and I really felt judged. Her body language changed and I swear she started ripping out hair harder! I was nearly in tears by the time I left. Here I am, going through the most difficult time in my life, sitting in the most vulnerable physical position possible, and I feel like I'm being tortured and judged by a crazy lady! I felt myself shut down and go into zombie mode, I paid my bill and left. I'm not great at standing up for myself in the heat of the moment. I just go limp and try to extricate myself as quickly as possible. So, I drove home and bitched to my husband and all of my friends and thought that was the end of it. She was fired. I was done. Never going back. Not saying boo. Easy.\n\nThen yesterday out of the blue she sends a smiley email saying she was thinking of me and asking how I'm doing. I was shocked! I really hoped to just forget about each other and go our separate ways, but apparently the exchange wasn't as aggressive as I perceived it to be. Half of me wants to continue to ignore the email. The other half feels like I owe her an explanation, even if its just to enlighten her on not being an asshole around her clients. The problem is, every time I start an email to her in my head it ends one of two ways. A. I roll over and show her my yellow belly, wind up apologizing for something I didn't do, end up scheduling my next appointment because I'm a pacifist or B. Unleash a tirade of frothing hormonal rage and end up threatening to burn her house down.\n\nHow do I kindly tell her how I feel without being mean but also stand up for myself and other women in my position. I respect her right to her own beliefs, and I appreciate the familiar conversation with someone who understands what I'm going through but I feel like a line was crossed.

This study was published in the peer-reviewed journal, Fertility &amp; Sterility (http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)01865-8/abstract).\n\n\n\n**TIMINGS**\nPacific Time: Monday, March 6th, 2017 at 4 pm\nMountain Time: Monday, March 6th, 2017 at 5 pm\nEastern Time: Monday, March 6th, 2017 at 7 pm\nBritish Time: Monday, March 6th, 2017 at 12 am\n\n\n**WHO IS DR. HORSAGER AND DR. AIMEE EYVAZZADEH?**\nDr. Alan Horsager is currently the President &amp; CEO of Episona, an epigenetic data company focused in men\u2019s reproductive health. Most recently, he was a Founder and Chief Science Officer of Eos Neuroscience, a company that continues to engineer optogenetic gene therapies for blindness and chronic pain. Alan received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Southern California where he currently is a visiting Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology. He has numerous scientific publications and issued patents, and has received several career awards including the Burroughs Wellcome Fund CASI award.\n\nDr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, also known as the \u201cEgg Whisperer,\" is one of America\u2019s most famous Fertility Doctors. Her success rate at baby-making gives future parents hope when nothing else has worked. She\u2019s had a hand in creating thousands of happy healthy babies. Dr. Aimee is a Harvard-educated board certi\ufb01ed OBGYN, specializing in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility; but she is best known for her Egg Freezing Parties. Her goal is to teach everyone about fertility awareness and how to #GetAheadOfInfertility. She has been featured in magazines like People and Marie Claire, and has been featured on the Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS Morning, and Fox Network.  In her off-time, Dr. Aimee is a Mom to four rambunctious young kids age 9 to 8 months.\n\n*Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh has no role at Episona. She uses Episona\u2019s Seed Fertility Test in her practice.\n\n\n\n**AMA FOCUS OF DISCUSSION**\nMeasuring a man\u2019s fertility has relied on the semen analysis for over 50 years. Is this enough today? Or do the incredible advances in epigenomic medicine offer us a better way to predict male fertility potential? We encourage participation from anyone wanting to know more about epigenetics and how it can help us better understand and diagnose male infertility. We look forward to discussing how this can help you and your doctor decide on the best fertility treatments. We also welcome discussion about how environmental factors and lifestyle (smoking, etc.) can affect your sperm epigenome. You can visit this link for an overview of epigenetics: https://www.episona.com/learn/\n\n\nEpisona is currently conducting the validation study on a large population with world renowned fertility clinics like: SCRC, RMANJ, CCRM, CCRMT, FCSA, MINN\u2026etc.\n\n\n**Dr. Horsager will share a sample test result on Monday and discuss it with us. We'll add that link in the edit here where it's ready.**\n\n\n\n**PARTICIPATION IN THE AMA**\nWe encourage anyone with interest in the epigenetics testing used to understand and diagnose male infertility to come along on Monday, March 6th and participate. If you can't make it, please reply to this post with your question or message the mods and we will make sure it's included in the AMA. If you see a question you would like to see answered please upvote it.\n\n\n\n**FURTHER INFORMATION**\nIf you want to know anything about this event, message the mod team. We can assure quick responses. Please don\u2019t ask personal questions pertaining to your situation. Nobody can give you medical advice without treating you as a patient. These questions will not be answered and possibly deleted. Both participants identities have been verified.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Join us for an AMA session on Monday, March 6 at 6pm PT with Dr. Alan Horsager and Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh on using epigenetics to inform infertility treatment and Seed, the first ever epigenetic male fertility test. https://www.episona.com/learn/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xbczl/join_us_for_an_ama_session_on_monday_march_6_at/"}, {"author": "plarpco", "author_created_utc": 1286560921, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4ewg6", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488562997, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1488583083, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xbrc8/infertility_financial_support_grant_applications/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5xbrc8", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5xbrc8/infertility_financial_support_grant_applications/", "retrieved_on": 1492372415, "score": 46, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi. My wife and I have struggled with infertility, and as a way to support others who are also sharing that struggle, we've started working with a foundation that provides grants for infertility costs to people in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri.\n\nThe Kevin J. Lederer Life foundation provides grants of up to $10,000 to individuals who need financial assistance to aid with services such as third party reproduction, adoption, or medical costs associated with IVF or other infertility procedures. They also directly donate IVF cycles from partner practices in Illinois.\n\n**Last year they were able to award 14 grants valued at over $140,000.**\n\nI'm not an official representative of the foundation. My wife and I donated to the foundation, and then reached out to them to see if they needed additional help, which is why I'm trying to spread the word. \n\nIf you live in the four states mentioned and need financial assistance, whether or not you have insurance coverage, please check out their website and submit a grant application next month. Alternatively, if you have the desire to give back and support a good cause and want to donate time or money, they could use your help. All of the staff positions are unpaid as their focus is giving out as much of their donated funds to grant recipients as possible.

I guess I'm feeling a little.....I dunno......not bummed because hopefully this'll be the help we need, but I guess slightly dejected maybe? More along the lines of feeling like I never knew this would be the path I'd have to take to get effing knocked up. \n\nIf 16-year old me knew how hard this would be I would've been less terrified of that boy getting me pregnant because I used his bath towel after him. And what if he had semen on that towel (I didn't even imagine *how* said semen got there) and let me go ask my mother if you can get knocked up from dried sperm contact! \n\nWe started trying in May 2015 after our wedding and I remember the first few months after that I was so optimistic. I was constantly in a state of, \"I am SO pregnant right now because I feel slightly nauseous. Way knocked up.\" When we finally did get pregnant last February I was elated, obviously, and the thought that we'd have a miscarriage never occurred to me since I was under the illusion that it was way more rare than it actually is. I was the one on message boards and forums calming the nerves of the other panicky women...assuring them that they were fine and their baby would be fine. And then on our first ultrasound I became that panicky woman. \n\nI started Clomid back in October around my 32nd Birthday. The first month I had some decent follicles, but nothing worth writing home over. Month two was a dud. At my Day 12 Follicle check they just looked like little grapes. Month three and four weren't really notable aside from month fours addition of trigger shot + IUI. We took a break in January just because emotionally I'm so sick of getting amped to just feel let down over and over and over and over. \n\nOn Monday I had my Day 3 FSH blood work done -- My Progesterone was &lt;0.2. My Estradiol was 56.9 and my FSH was 7.9 -- all in the normal ranges for their perspective values. Wednesday we went back and I had an HSG done. Let me just say I'm slightly glad I didn't Google ahead of time for that one because holy shit balls was that the worst pain I've yet to experience in my life, and that comes from knowing the pain of a ruptured appendix, broken bones and having my skull sawed open (Mastoidectomy). That shit was real. But, results came back a-ok. \n\nToday was my Day 11 (I typically go on Day 12 but after my HSG and seeing I had some 14mm follicles they decided today was okay to check) and my first month on Femara. I seem to have a better response to this than the Clomid as I had one that was almost 20mm. Fingers crossed I suppose?\n\nI guess what just keeps grating my gears is that I have no reason for any of this - and I know that falls under \"unexplained infertility\" but in my whole life nothing suggested I'd have a hard time. My mother? Psssshhh. Woman has had 15 surgeries for PCOS and just the worst gynecological history of anybody I know and she had my brother and me. I have no \"issues\" with my period and I haven't since I first got it when I was 12 years old. Clockwork. Everything runs the way it should....\n\nSo how did y'all get to the point of accepting that it is what it is? That you have no answers or reasons and that resonates as \"okay\"?\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "RE Appointment Scheduled", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xch5i/re_appointment_scheduled/"}, {"author": "Shopgrl152", "author_created_utc": 1487560708, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "28 | TTC since 11/15 | Medicated cycles, Mild MFI, 1 CP", "author_fullname": "t2_15ked0", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488575062, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1488657652, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xd0bu/making_the_leap_from_timed_intercourse_to_iui/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5xd0bu", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5xd0bu/making_the_leap_from_timed_intercourse_to_iui/", "retrieved_on": 1492373043, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey y'all.

A long time ago when I was trying for my daughter who is now 3 and just recently asking opinions about the care I was receiving while trying for baby #2. \n\nI was going to a local ob who finally, after a year of treating me, told me he needed to refer me to the mayo clinic (1.5hrs away) because this town is too small and they don't have the equipment needed to even perform the ultrasounds I requested to check follicles and lining. He had me on clomid for like 8 cycles and then tried femara for 2 cycles all unmonitored. I wish there was something I could do about him basically wasting my time, money and chances.\n\nSo just had the appointment at Mayo, who told me that my best chance would be IVF. She said that we have one more cycle of clomid/femara left for lifetime and we could go guns blazing with it and do an iui. She also said that injectables could be an option but chances are increased with ivf and the cost benefit in the long run is better with ivf. I started crying and I'm so upset it took so long for me to basically tell my ob to either monitor or refer me but that he, after cycles of me requesting, never mentioned he couldn't do it. Not to mention for testing and procedure wise we'll be driving 1.5hrs away and we have no support system of friends or family where we live to look after our daughter who can be in daycare during the day but not if we need to go up night before retrieval and transfers.\n\nShould we try the last cycle of clomid with iui, and being monitored? Or is it time to put my big girl panties on and just five straight into ivf since my new DR believes it would be the best chance at conceiving?\n\nI am really glad this subreddit exists, I basically have no support from family/friends. Most don't know what is going on and when I told my,mom that ivf was my only option at this point she just said \"oh that sucks\" and never replied back.\n\n(just as a sidenote, my husband's insurance is decent and looks like they'll cover a huge chunk of it however we have yet to actually sit down and discuss specific pricing and coverage)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Living in a small town isn't the best for infertility treatment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xh2p1/living_in_a_small_town_isnt_the_best_for/"}, {"author": "Bobcatluv", "author_created_utc": 1448938320, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "35, since 1/2014, one ectopic, one tube, low AMH, POF", "author_fullname": "t2_skpab", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488641488, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xhe20/rant_why_does_ifcommunity_servant_in_the_minds_of/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5xhe20", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 56, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5xhe20/rant_why_does_ifcommunity_servant_in_the_minds_of/", "retrieved_on": 1492375240, "score": 32, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I posted a few weeks ago about my recent finding that I was sperm donor conceived. I used the work employee assistance program (therapy) and met with a pretty good therapist about three times to work out my feelings about all of it. \n\nI mentioned my own struggle with IF in one of the sessions, but it was not a focal point. At my final session, the T wanted to discuss a little more about my IF with the possibility of meeting for more sessions in the future. I was game, although my husband and I have already resolved not to move forward with IVF. I expressed to the T that we continue to hope we may one day get pregnant without intervention, but if not, that's okay, too.\n\nI told the T that obviously, it's a little sad not having kids and we don't wish to adopt at this point. I have some anxiety about how awful my own mother was, as well. At this point, the T took it upon herself to start pointing out ways I can \"practice\" mothering and work with kids. She suggested volunteering at a local home for young mothers with babies or coaching little league at a local park. \n\nMind you, I used to teach and coach in public schools for ten years, and I TOLD her this. It's noble work to volunteer, but I'm tired of taking care of other people's kids. I wanted my own and I've been dealing with the probability it won't happen since my diagnosis, for almost a year now. \n\nI'm so sick of hearing and reading about people who think it's the job of those who are IF to volunteer and help the rest of the world all the time. Once you point out how hard it is to adopt, they say, \"Well you can just foster a kid\" without the understanding that the point of foster care is to reunite families. It's as though they think IF women have some pent up \"mothering energy\" and we're being just plain selfish for not using it on other people's kids.\n\nPlease understand, I know foster care is important for kids; my parents fostered a troubled teen for a time when I was young.

In short, I've always had regular cycles, but have a history of 2 ovarian surgeries for cyst removal (one on each side, one full lap and one laproscopic) and endo was found during both surgeries.  Mr.Jully has average to above average sperm.  All testing done last summer was fine, but AMH was below average for my age @1.8, as my ovarian reserve has likely been impacted by surgery.  I did 3 rounds of letrozole with timed intercourse, 1 IUI with letrozole and trigger, and I'm at the end of another failed IUI cycle with trigger- this time with clomid.  Just for arguments sake, the first IUI may have been timed too early, as my lead follicle, estrogen, and lining were all on the lower end before I triggered.\n\nWhen I first began IUIs I was hopeful- I had a clear HSG, great sperm, good response to medication, what could go wrong?!  After the first one failed, I met with the RE who pissed in my cornflakes (or shit in my wheaties? whatever).  She thinks that I likely have structural, egg reserve, and egg and environmental quality issues from surgery, scar tissue, and endo.  BUT she wouldn't consider an injectable IUI because of my 'young age' and the unpredictability of response/risk of HOM and pushed me to a Clomid IUI.\n\nNow that the second IUI has failed, I feel emotionally done. I feel like any more IUIs would be a waste of my time and just a hurdle I'm 'supposed' to jump through because 3 is the magic number.  My infertility isn't 'unexplained' and I don't think throwing more IUIs at a structural/quality problem is going to do me any good.  However, obviously I would love to try to procreate in the least medically-invasive manner possible, and don't want my impatience and frustration to make me hasty in this process.  After doing a lot of reading about endo and IF treatment following my last consult, I'm now hesitant to consider injectables for IUI anyway, since it seems they can exacerbate endo with a relatively low chance of success.  I had a great response to clomid but it made me want to hurt people and cry for a week. So I wouldn't even know what kind of medication I would feel comfortable considering if I were to be persuaded into another IUI. \n\nI have a follow-up consult with the RE on Wednesday.  In this moment what I want to do is take a break from all treatment for a few months, come up to breathe, and then start to mentally and emotionally prepare for IVF in June.  Mr.Jully has amazing coverage for treatment, including IVF.  But knowing that I have great IVF coverage makes me wonder if I'm not giving IUI a fair shot.  I also wonder if taking a break from treatment for a few months will make me feel like I'm doing 'nothing' when I could have been doing 'something' (IUIs) in the meantime.\n\nGive it to me straight - What are your thoughts? What would you do? Am I being impatient and hasty or realistic given my history? Would you do more IUIs and with what medication? Have you taken breaks during your journey and have you found them to be helpful or did they make you crazy?  \n\nThanks for reading my scattered thoughts- all input is much appreciated.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "WWYD next?

The first one was canceled 2 days before egg retrieval because I ovulated despite being on Ganarelix.  This cycle, my RE has switched me to Cetrotide starting on day 7.  I had a scan on day 3, but no bloodwork.  I am scheduled to see him again on day 12.  I asked the nurse at checkout to verify with the RE.  She reviewed the plan and agreed that it was probably a mistake.  She said she would call to follow up, but I never received a call.  I called back and another nurse told me the treatment plan was correct.\n\nAnyone else not have scans or bloodwork for that many days?  I trust my RE but the nurses have not always been on top of things.  Just curious of your experiences.  We have no insurance coverage and this is the last chance we will be able to afford which increases my anxiety over everything.

I have undergone 1 IUI (only to be told afterwards by a specialist that IUI's rarely work), and 3 Ivf's - all failed. I have tried everything from specialists, witch doctors, religions (plural because I have visited several places of worship), visiting different countries, miracle cures, old wives tales, everything. I was once told that having a pet would ease any stress I had and that several people fall pregnant after owning animals. I bought a dog - he is fabulous and the love of our life, but he turns 3 in June. I was told that if I make myself busy with work and study that it would be too \"inconvenient\" for me to have a child and therefore the universe would allow me to be pregnant. I am now half way through my law degree, work full-time in a law firm and own a restaurant with my lovely husband. \"Go on a holiday, you will fall pregnant then\". I have been to 17 countries on holiday since I first started trying. Nothing seems to work.\n\nI have \"unexplained infertility\", my husband has above average sperm count and is healthy, I have above average fertility and viable eggs. I do have PCOS but it is well managed with fertility treatment.\n\nI don't have any questions, I just need to talk. \n\nI'm from a small regional town in Australia where it seems everyone is easily able to conceive. Although I don't have bitter feelings toward those that are lucky enough to have children first go, I am bitter that I have no one to relate to or that can understand my frustration. I do have an amazing husband, but as anyone who has been through this situation can understand, it isn't that productive to continuously burden the other person in the situation with how you feel when you are both supposed to be staying positive. \n\nFor several years, when I try to discuss how I feel with others, I am constantly told \"don't stress you are so young\" or \"it's just not in God's plan right now\". What? I may have been young 4 years ago but look how fast that went. Will it ever be in his plan?\n\nI have gone through my entire life with a fine tooth comb to try and see what I did wrong that could equate to me not being good enough to have children. I have only ever wanted to be a mother.\n\nI just spent the last 7 months without fertility treatment trying to repair the damage done by my last 3 Ivf's. Next week I undergo a partial mastectomy of my right breast to remove a tumour that suddenly appeared a few months ago. I am slowly regaining my memory and am increasing my sleep at night. I just started losing some of the 18.5kgs I gained in the 3 months after ceasing treatment in August 2016 due to hormone changes.\n\nI am struggling with this idea that maybe I'm not destined to have my own biological children, but then another mind says \"that's bs, you will be a mother\". I just wish someone could give me a definite answer so I know whether to keep pushing on with treatment (negatively impacting my physical/mental state) or to call it quits and invest in adoption. \n\nI looked into adoption recently, it is currently a 6 year wait. It's takes 2 years to be approved. I need to have stopped fertility treatment prior to this. \n\nBut to me, stopping treatment is that same as giving up. And I can't give up in my children. I can't. \n\nI have a friend who suggested she would be happy to be a surrogate, but my state surrogate laws force that I sign a statutory declaration stating that I will cease trying to conceive and then a surrogate can come to play. I can't sign that. It would be a lie. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I move on? How do I stay sane? I'm scared. I'm scared of what last year's treatment did to me. But I'm even more scared of what not having children will do to me. My husband is a great guy, but every human has a limit on disappointment. What is in our future. I'm so scared. \n\n4years, $82,000 later. Now I must wipe my tears and go give my speech at university this afternoon on how anything is possible and success is for those who believe and work hard.

Increasing research interest has investigated the effect of low carbohydrate diets, with or without energy restriction. We aimed to systematically review the published literature to determine the extent to which low carbohydrate diets can affect fertility outcomes; \n\n(2) Methods: The review protocol was registered prospectively with Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42016042669) and followed Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Infertile women were the population of interest, the intervention was low carbohydrate diets (less than 45% total energy from carbohydrates), compared to usual diet (with or without co-treatments). Four databases were searched from date of commencement until April 2016; a supplementary Google scholar search was also undertaken. Title and abstract, then full text review, were undertaken independently and in duplicate. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were checked to ensure that all relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Quality assessment was undertaken independently by both authors using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research. Outcome measures were improved fertility outcomes defined by an improvement in reproductive hormones, ovulation rates and/or pregnancy rates;\n\n (3) Results: Seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the evidence synthesis. Interventions were diverse and included a combination of low carbohydrate diets with energy deficit or other co-treatments. Study quality was rated as positive for six studies, suggesting a low risk of bias, with one study rated as neutral. Of the six studies which reported changes in reproductive hormones, five reported significant improvements post intervention; \n\n(4) Conclusion: The findings of these studies suggest that low carbohydrate diets warrant further research to determine their effect. These randomised controlled trials should consider the effect of carbohydrates (with or without energy deficit) on hormonal and fertility outcomes.\n\n==&gt; http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/3/204/htm", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Effect of Low Carbohydrate Diets on Fertility Hormones and Outcomes in Overweight and Obese Women: A Systematic Review - full text", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xpj5y/the_effect_of_low_carbohydrate_diets_on_fertility/"}, {"author": "k_snowflake", "author_created_utc": 1483396961, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "34F,  5-15, 1 CP, PCOS, maybe the dingo ate my baby?", "author_fullname": "t2_1436bv", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488758003, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5xpz69/fear_of_another_announcement/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5xpz69", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 44, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5xpz69/fear_of_another_announcement/", "retrieved_on": 1492379613, "score": 20, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I spent this weekend with my sister and family.

This is probably going to be a long post but I kinda need a sounding board this morning. My story starts when I was 16 and got my first surgery and an emergency surgery to remove a massive cyst and got my PCOS diagnosis. Many cysts, ruptures, miscarriages, and years of hoping that maybe one day I'll be able to have my own child, I was able to conceive my daughter naturally. My pregnancy however was extremely complicated and I had tons of health complications and I ended up with an emergency c-section but my daughter and I were both happy and healthy. Like anyone else, I had my fair share of issues; family drama, financial strains - I basically had my own shit going on before. And then my daughter suddenly passed away and I wanted to die with her. My life turned upside down and hasn't turned right side up since. I couldn't fathom how a perfectly healthy, gorgeous 3 month baby girl just all the sudden was gone? Come to find out, my cesarean was botched, and I just had surgery to remove more cysts and adhesions, Endo. Remove my organs from each other and untangle my tubes. Only to prove how much of a miracle that she was, that is constantly so hard and I lost her? And \n\nWell, I started to learn a few things very fast. And I want to address these. 1. After going through other losses, like a miscarriage, I was able to survive those through the privacy of it. I was able to go about my day without feeling like the world viewed me as a failure. I learned the second that you lose a previously healthy, living child, everyone assumes the worst. And they are instantly unable to give you any support in your grieving process and they're unable to recognize the insensitivity in their curiosity. I have many co-workers or friends who have suffered other losses, like a miscarriage or still birth and I can't help but become enraged. Not at them directly, I should clarify. But at the support they receive, like they're more deserving because they're less likely to have been the cause? Suddenly everyone you know becomes a detective and wants to know every detail of your life. And the reality of it is, SIDS is so incomprehensible that I get it's easier to have a reason. But it's disgusting that they always assume the worst.\n2. People always ask you to support others. This morning I lost it because a co-worker of mine who is recently pregnant contacted me about a charity that she is started for a friend of hers. (How sweet). Except her friend has PCOS and Endo and can't conceive. Well, I can relate. I feel for this girl. But honestly. I'm still paying my daughter's medical bills from her dying and I'm trying to have my own baby and will probably need to pay for my own IVF. WHY ARE PEOPLE BEGGING ME FOR MONEY? No one wanted to raise money for my daughter's medical expenses or my fertility treatment. But they think I'm the best person to message and ask for money?\n\nIt's these things I find you can't find an article on Google about to help you relate and feel like someone knows what you're going through. Or even on here. I've never felt so alone in my life. All I want is another child. Not even as a replacement. Just to prove to myself I can do it, my body can do it. And lightening won't strike twice so I don't live in fear. My husband says he isn't ready. And that upsets me because I want one like yesterday. It's so hard. \n\nEdit: I know this sub may not be the best one, but I was hoping I would find more people who would relate than posting in grief. I feel like I need to find more like-minded people, rather than bonding over death? I don't mean to sound insensitive if that's how I come off. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hoping someone understands?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5y0u32/hoping_someone_understands/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_by": "moderators", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488908389, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5y205t/infertile_due_to_injury_and_living_with_chronic/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5y205t", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5y205t/infertile_due_to_injury_and_living_with_chronic/", "retrieved_on": 1492385646, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Infertile due to injury, and living with chronic pain in what's left of my testicles.

Between work, nearing the end of our infertility treatment options, the end of our money and longing for the end of our heartache, I need to move on. Or, at least start weaning myself away. I've needed to start distancing myself from this place to focus on my future, my career and my marriage. No one can stay here forever, but not everyone moves on with a baby.\n\nAs I look to a likely child-free future, as I sit with all of that hurt and fear, I'm longing for perspective. We have one more IVF cycle planned, but today, for the 3rd month in a row, I've been benched for a cyst. \n\nI went of Facebook to wish my nephew a happy birthday, and I saw a post that angered me at the world. I have a cousin who is 42 and dying of pancreatic cancer. She's stopped chemo and is spending time with her family (she's my cousins wife, but in my family, that makes us primas). She's been fighting this disease for over 2 years, and she is out of options. She has a 12yo son and a husband along with siblings and parents and grandparents. \n\nSomeone, I'm not sure who, posted on her wall about a juice people can make at home that cures cancer in 2 days. If the bingoes we receive about standing on our heads and eating pineapple feel like hand grenades, that post must have felt like a nuclear bomb. \n\nI'm not here to diminish your pain in anyway or to say \"at least we're not dying\" because I know the pain is real, and sometimes, death doesn't seem so bad. But can you imagine the pain my cousin and her family feel reading stupid things like this? She's facing her mortality and everyone is having to come to terms with loosing her knowing there's nothing that can be done and then some person posts the most hurtful and ignorant bullshit.\n\nWe all know the person who would do this. This person is ignorant, this person is insensitive, this person probably doesn't vaccinate, this person judges you and your non-organic cheddar cheese, this person has never felt the pain of infertility or death, this person distrusts modern medicine/science, this person has said you need to find organic IVF meds, this person said you need to be gluten free, this person told you to adopt one of those free and perfect needy babies they heard about someplace. This person is a virus degrading our humanity.\n\n**EDIT** Whoa guys! I didn't think this post would be given so much attention, but it *is* a topic we deal with so often. I wish I didn't have this huge deadline at work, or I'd be more involved in the conversations going on here. You guys are all wise beyond your years.

We're about 20 cycles into TTC with an early loss around cycle 10 and I'll be 38 in November. \n\nI give some background info below and I've tried poring through past posts because I don't doubt this has been asked before, BUT, basically what I'm wondering is: \n\n- Do you have info or research articles that speak about infertility bloodwork results that you can recommend? Cold Dr. Googling has certainly pointed me to a number of sites, but now I'm encountering so much conflicting information (I know already that \"assays\" or numbers are different so not just conflicting information about exact numbers of results). In other words, I'm looking to understand the results of my tests on my own to a degree, since I've read that different REs have different attitudes about these results. I have results for CD3 estradiol and FSH, AMH (I took it on CD3), and also 7DPO progesterone. \n\n- How did you decide on choosing an RE or infertility clinic? I may have one approved to me through my insurance, but I know my insurance only covers some things (and nothing to do with IVF) so I'm wondering if it isn't better to make a choice about the \"best\" in the area for us over the \"only one in my plan\" if much of what they do won't be covered anyway. \n\nMy ob/gyn is a very lovely person but also very much in the \"just keep trying\" category and that time has passed frankly. The little I'm aware of IVF is that when I turn 38 I'm in a different statistical category. So she finally ordered bloodwork for me and offered to schedule a HSG. I've got the results for the first batch and just did the 7DPO today. Once these are complete she said depending on whatever they reveal she can refer me to a RE. \n\nI have no doubt these questions have been discussed before so I'll keep searching  by terms as well, but any links or thoughts are appreciated. \n\nI never used Reddit before going down this spiral that is \"TTC\" and my thanks and gratitude for its existence is huge. A full confession: two years ago I was that a**hole googling stuff about TTC and rolling my eyes at \"those women\" on sites like the Bump thinking \"I'll never be like that.\" Nothing like experience as a teacher. If \"like that\" translated to \"desparate\" in my head then, I know now that it translates to \"caring really hard about something and wanting to care about it in community.\" \n\nlove to you all today &lt;3", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro and Question About Interpreting CD3 and 7DPO Infertility Bloodwork", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5y4bwa/intro_and_question_about_interpreting_cd3_and/"}, {"author": "dawndilioso", "author_created_utc": 1485375086, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "40F unexp | 3 IUI, 2 ER=1 PGS | on ER 3", "author_fullname": "t2_14rwut", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488932486, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5y4lsa/increasing_gonal_vs_menopur/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5y4lsa", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5y4lsa/increasing_gonal_vs_menopur/", "retrieved_on": 1492386949, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I hate that there's no good database of results for me to go query...

I've been reading this forum for some time as we work thru this shitty process. I am 41 and have been struggling since age 36. We tried half assedly for a year and then seriously for another 8 months until a dr visit revealed a large mass on my ovary.  They thought it was the big c so immediately operated and it was a Dermoid and a big mess of endo (stage 4 endo). Healed from that and tried 3 months and straight to ivf where I did three cycles over the next year and failed all. Did not even make it to retrieval as I would barely respond to meds.  \n\nThen we made the decision to do donor egg (husband has no issues) and waited a year for a donor to become available. (Big NYC clinic). This was actually not terrible as I was able to recover mentally and grieve the loss. By the time we got the donor I was ready! She is perfect and is very similar to me in appearance and some other traits.  We do the process and I end up failing that too. We have 7 embryos frozen so that's great - the donor was a rockstar and so was my husband. It's just me. First the lining wasn't triple striped then the dr saw little pockets or cysts in my lining so he cancelled me. Dr did try to aspirate but he still didn't like how it looked.  He says this just happens but I am wondering wtf because I had a mock cycle 8 months ago that was fine and a normal saline sonogram right at the beginning of the cycle. \n\nThey are inducing a period and doing another saline sono after that and if that is okay we try again with me. It also always seemed my estrogen was never building up fast enough despite the patches. And towards the end my progesterone was low. And my thyroid is borderline at 2.5. All these issues I didn't know I had. \n\nI am very upset because I was sold on donor as a slam dunk and my stupid body failed the \"easy\" part. Has anyone had a bad lining and then was ok for the next cycle? I am worried this is something bad but my dr says it's not cancer etc.  \n\nCould stress affect it? I have an ill family member and there was a lot of stress and sleepless nights around that. My nurse said there is nothing I did to cause this but I wonder.  I also had wine a few times. If I am allowed to proceed I will not do that and will eat better, do more yoga and accupuncture.

I wanted to get a handle on costs because we're totally OOP (and I have a high deductible health plan that doesn't pay for anything until I meet the deductible- so even meds that are covered like estrogen will be OOP until I spend another $800 then co-pays kick in depending on the tier of med) and we're seriously very tapped out financially after IVF.  So I was a little bummed to hear from the nurse that I might be looking at about $1,000 worth of meds.  Is this normal?  \n\n\nHere is what she said I'd need:\n\n\n\n* bcp - have them and they are free anyway w/ insurance for 3 weeks-- starting tomorrow.\n\n\n\n* Lupron 2 week kit which she said is about $500.  Is this real/accurate?  I looked on GoodRx and found that you can get the kit at Walmart (appears the same dose/strength) for $185.  Has anyone done this and not gone through a specialty pharmacy?  I'm planning to (because I have to do this financially...) go to Walmart this weekend and ask them about availability/process for getting this med since it's somewhat specialty.  Just wanted to see if anyone has been there done that with a retail pharmacy.\n\n\n\n* Vivelle dots- nurse said these were \"quite expensive\" and I don't know how many I need.  What's common?  First of all I see there is a generic available- is the generic just as good?  It does not appear to be a TON cheaper, but every bit helps.   For an 8 count of the dots, GoodRX says I can get this at Walgreens for $38 (again, any experience with a retail pharmacy having this product in stock or being able to get it for you? - that's the generic)  My insurance says 90 for generic (8 dots) and 120 for brand name.   Another question on the patches- where do you place these on your body?  The nurse also said that insurance will sometimes cover this, but not at the doses they require so it will be out of pocket.  So that makes me think 8 dots is not going to last me a cycle\n\n\n* Estrace oral tablets - I have these \"in stock\" at home from previous cycles and I know they are cheap even if I need to buy more.\n\n\n* prometrium tablets (used vaginally)- I have these \"in stock\" also from previous months/my recent loss.  If I need more, I know there is a GoodRx coupon to get me a discount as my insurance seems to treat this med like some high tier specialty thing-- even the generic version.\n\n\n* Crinone gel- this was the big one I was not expecting. (why both crinone and prometrium tabs)  I assumed PIO which is expensive too, but cheaper I think- this is like $20 a day no?  I see a $150 off or $15 total copay coupon online that I will try my best to use with my insurance (with insurance it's supposed to be only $15 and it seems like my insurance will cover this-- any experience with insurance covering it when they don't cover any infertility stuff?)  And I suppose if I need to drop $500 on this stuff, it will at least go against my deductible if I can use a network pharmacy.   Any experience getting this one off the shelf/ordered through a local retail pharmacy or do you need to go mail order specialty?\n\n\n* steroid, antibiotic, etc.  - insurance should cover this, but I know doxycycline is used and I was on that for sinus infection- that is not cheap (when you have the type of prescription plan I have-- I had to use a GoodRx coupon for that too)\n\n\n\nSorry for all the maybe lame/newbie questions.  With IVF meds (and I did injectables in the past), it was always straight forward -- had to get them at mail order places. Now it seems like I have more choice and I want to find the best cost savings I can.  The nurse took total control of my IVF scripts and I now have like $1,000 worth of meds sitting in my cabinet at home because she didn't account for overfill (I would have ordered less and assumed overfill...reordered if needed) and she gave me no chance to shop around for prices- now granted I had literally 2 days to order/get my meds but they did the same thing with my IUI meds and I had to ask them to NOT send things without allowing me to pick the pharmacy because I had First Steps/Compassionate Care discounts that some places did not take.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FET Protocol/Meds Questions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5y9wt4/fet_protocolmeds_questions/"}, {"author": "AngelicBread", "author_created_utc": 1400036807, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_gk2se", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1489001276, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1489017130, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ya0i0/what_do_i_do_now_male_subfertilityinfertility/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ya0i0", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5ya0i0/what_do_i_do_now_male_subfertilityinfertility/", "retrieved_on": 1492389654, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I guess I should start off with some background information.

I have been reading all your posts and first let me say, you are all so incredible and this is a wonderful community. I\u2019d like some advice. My husband and I have been TTC for a year now. I decided to go the gynecologist for some help and advice. My story goes back to when I was in High School. When I was a sophomore I missed my period for a whole year so we went to get that checked out. Thinking that I might have PCOS they did an ultra sound and everything came back normal, no PCOS and no other diagnosis. They gave me birth control and sent me on my way. I took it for 3 months and then I decided I was too lazy to take it plus I wasn\u2019t sexually active so whatever. My cycles were completely normal after that (28-33 day cycles). Then after I got married I got back on birth control, then off again a year later. After birth control my periods were very irregular.  I would get them every other month. Sometimes they would be heavy, sometimes I would just have spotting. Sometimes I would cramp, sometimes I would not. It was just all over the place. I was also reading \u201cTaking Charge of your Fertility\u201d and I knew that I was not ovulating. I went to the doctor, hearing from friends that it would be easy, I would just need the Doc to give me clomid. So I went in. That day I had started my period. They did bloodwork and said to come back in 2 weeks. I went back 2 weeks later and I was still bleeding. The doc put me on the Eat to Live diet because everything was all out of whack, I have high cholesterol, triglycerides were high, HDLs low, vitamin d low, prolactin levels high(54). So he said, do this diet and come back in 2 months. And I had to remind that I was still bleeding and I was concerned about that. He gave me progesterone to help stop the bleeding, a week later I was still bleeding, I was bleeding harder than I have ever bled in my entire life. I went through 2 super tampon boxes in 2 weeks. And the progesterone did nothing. After a month of HEAVY bleeding I finally stopped. The doctor was concerned that I didn\u2019t respond at all to the progesterone and he ordered another prolactin test and ultra sound. The ultrasound had tiny follicles but he said that those might just go away with the diet I was on. The prolactin test which came back high again (61). Now they want me to get an MRI. An MRI that is easy for them to ask for but I have to fork over $2100 for it. What if they don\u2019t find anything wrong me!? And I just spent $2100 for a nice portrait of my brain.\n\nTLDR: prolactin levels are high (54-61) Doc wants an MRI, I'm skeptical and I don't have $2100 lying around. No PCOS, Nothing on my ultrasound that was concerning. \n\nSo my question is have any of you been through any of this? What was your experience? Is there anything I can do to naturally lower my prolactin levels? Since I just started this Eat to Live diet would it be worth it for me to wait a little while to see if this Diet will help my Prolactin levels?\n\nAlso, has anyone ever experienced a change in body odor with birth control? Cause I swear my birth control made my armpits smell terrible, I couldn\u2019t even use deodorant because it would make it ten times worse. I had to resort to a natural deodorant from Lush and even with that by the end of the work day I was in need of a shower!\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questions, bloodwork, n00b.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5ybbzu/questions_bloodwork_n00b/"}, {"author": "Canyouhelpmeottawa", "author_created_utc": 1368713228, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "who highjacked MY FUCKING STORK?!?!?!?", "author_fullname": "t2_bp6vn", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1489023745, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5yc7r0/chat_tonight/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5yc7r0", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5yc7r0/chat_tonight/", "retrieved_on": 1492390757, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "http://webchat.snoonet.org/infertility\n\njoin in the chat tonight!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "chat tonight?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5yc7r0/chat_tonight/"}, {"author": "fl0recere", "author_created_utc": 1479271709, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36F, TTC#1 cycle 15, unexplained, letrozole", "author_fullname": "t2_12uj5n", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1489033091, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/5yczhk/insurance_covers_gift/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5yczhk", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/5yczhk/insurance_covers_gift/", "retrieved_on": 1492391149, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Any idea why my insurance would cover GIFT but not IVF?

So IVF+ICSI is our only answer to having children. We are very lucky that it worked well the first time. We did a fresh transfer with one embryo, which resulted in a positive outcome. We had two embryos to freeze.\n\nWe signed up for the Attain program the first time. Our clinic only offers the option to do 3 fresh and 3 frozen cycles at a cost of about $28k. If you don't take home a baby, you get a refund. (Drugs and PGS are not included, $28k is just for the monitoring and clinic procedures.)\n\nWe did this the first time because we didn't know what to expect. We have to pay for IVF completely out of pocket so we technically \"overpaid\" by about $16k. That wasn't great, obviously, but we got what we wanted, so how can you be mad?\n\nWe originally were hoping to do an FET for our second. That's where we ran into problems. We decided to thaw, biopsy, and PGS our remaining two embryos. One did not survive the thaw. The other was abnormal (trisomy 16). So we lost them both. Back to IVF+ICSI we go. I start stims later this month.\n\nMy question: Knowing that we do well with IVF, should we do the Attain program again or not? It's an emotional trap, right? IVF is so shitty all around that you want any kind of guarantee. But if you need anything less than two fresh cycles and one frozen (doing some rough math), the \"house\" wins and you overpay. But that guarantee is there.\n\nIf you pay for anything out of pocket and it fails, that money is just gone.\n\nMy husband thinks it's dumb to pay extra for Attain again, since we know that IVF works well for us. I agree with him on the one hand, but on the other, what if we hit more issues? We thought we had two embryos to count on, only to end up with zero. Because what happened there, I'm beginning to think our success was a fluke. It worked out a little TOO well. Are we going to hit more issues? Nobody knows. That's the hell of this process.\n\nI'm flinging around these figures like it's easy for us to spend an extra $16k. It's not. It would be a big blow if we sprung for Attain but ended up only needing one fresh cycle again, that we could've spent $12k on instead of $28k. But if that cycle fails, that $12k a la carte payment disappears with nothing to show for it, too.\n\nAttain was an easy decision the first time because we didn't know what to expect. Now that we do, should we spring for it again just so there's not so much pressure on this first fresh cycle? I know you guys aren't me and don't have the same circumstances, but I'm at the end of my freaking rope thinking about this. What would YOU do if faced with this situation? Is that guarantee worth the potential extra investment?

So after being benched on bcp for the last month because my lining didn't shed (for reasons no one can explain), I'm finally CD1 and supposed to start IUI 2. \n\nMy dog has been sick. I haven't posted about it because I don't really know how it will turn out, which has made it difficult to process. But the bottom line is that she has to have surgery tomorrow. We are taking her to a specialty surgeon and she has to be dropped off there at 7:30 tomorrow. And then I have to be in court (I'm a lawyer, I'm not in trouble) on a tough child custody case an hour away at 9. It's going to be a terribly stressful morning/day as is.\n\nSo of course CD 1 is today. And of course they need to do my labs tomorrow before 10. And I just had to be like \"nope sorry can't do it.\" I asked if their weekend office could do it on Saturday and apparently, no, the weekend office doesn't do CD 2, 3, 4 labs. Nevermind that some FAQ section on their patient portal says that they do. (Remember when we were talking about celebs doing IVF? You think Chrissy Teigen's doctor tells her she can't do Saturday labs?)   So there I am trying to figure out if there's anyway I can make it to the doctor between the vet and court, but there is not. These locations are all pretty much on opposite sides of the city in morning rush hour traffic. The RE has another office like *right fucking next to the vet* but I can't go there either because they are already booked tomorrow morning.  \n\nSo they said I can come in Monday on CD 5. It's the best they can do, it's \"probably fine.\" But knowing my body, it will already be doing too much by CD 5.   I don't think I've even had a period last until CD 5 since I was like 19. I feel like the nurse thinks I'm not taking this seriously if the dog and work come first, but that's probably in my head. Surely other people have scheduling problems. I also don't understand why they can't do the labs *later tomorrow* and just call me Monday with the results. But they won't. Maybe there's a reason these have to be done in the morning that I don't know about. \n\nI was such a normal happy person while on the bcp break. I have been dreading restarting the scheduling clusterfuck of active cycling with a job that is occasionally completely inflexible. But I didn't think the scheduling would get fucked immediately. I really just want to have a tantrum and quit trying for awhile, but I know I would regret that later because I still want a baby. I am also aware that this is probably a 100% irrational reaction to post bcp hormone fluctuations. I'm also stressed about the dog which doesn't help. Obviously so many people tolerate much more complicated scheduling issues (this isn't even ivf for fuck's sake) and who knows, CD 5 is probably fine. But it I'm just so frustrated, it's a harsh change from the last 3 carefree weeks and I find myself wondering why I do this to myself.\n\nUgh okay. I feel a little better now.

We've never tried to prevent pregnancy (because I was told it'd be very hard for me to get pregnant anyway as I rarely had a period) and I never got pregnant. We \"officially\" started trying right after we got married in 2013, but we have yet to be successful. Early last year my best friend and my husbands best friends wife got pregnant within one month of each other. Although I was ecstatic for them, I was also sad that I hadn't been able to be pregnant with my best friend like we had talked about doing all these years ago. Now I play Aunt to the baby and love her to death, but it's still a little bitter sweet.\n\n\nIn 2014 my regular gyno had me try 3 rounds of Clomid. She had assured me when I first started going to her (before we really knew any of my reproductive issues) that she would in fact get me pregnant, eventually. She didn't want to go past 3 rounds of clomid because of my family history, my mother dying of uterine cancer in 2007 at age 52, and my increased risk, so we stopped at 3 rounds. I took time off from trying in 2015 because I gained custody of my great niece when she was 2 years old, so I had a ton of refocusing and adjustment to do. Finally after putting my reproduction issues aside for almost 2 years I decided to start seeing a reproductive endocrinologist back in July 2016.\n\n\nMy new dr ended up doing a uterine ultrasound as well as a uterine biopsy because my lining was over 3x thicker than that of a normal uterine lining. My mother passed away from uterine cancer in 2007, so my doctor was understandably concerned with how things were going for me so he put me on Provera 10mg for 6 months and told me to follow up with a gynecologist/oncologist to see if the provera worked and where to go from there. (we switched insurance carriers and I went back to my regular gyno instead of the gyno/onc at 6 months) She ended up doing a hysteroscopy and a D&amp;C this morning, also removing a few polyps she found, and sent everything to pathology. Hopefully it'll be good news.\n\n\nIt's just all so frustrating I'm having such a hard time, as I know the ladies of this subreddit understand. So far, outside of the initial Clomid, the other things done have been to try to get my uterus in normal working order before even trying additional fertility things. My gyno informed me that once I'm able to have a child, she'd like to go ahead and seriously consider a hysterectomy so we didn't have to worry about things progressing to a dangerous place again in the future.\n\n\nTo add to my frustrations, my 23 year old niece just found out she's pregnant for a THIRD time. She had her first child taken away by CPS, who I'm now raising, her second child was also taken away and is in foster care, and she is now talking about how she wants an abortion but can't afford it. It's so disheartening to hear these things! Sometimes I wonder why it's so easy for someone like her to get pregnant, 23, addicted to drugs and a wild, party, carefree, no-job lifestyle, but for someone like myself, almost 32, responsible, college educated, hard working and loving husband who provides for our family, I don't even know if I'll be able to keep my uterus, much less have a child of my own.\n\n\nI've already told my husband that if I can't have my own child, I'd love to adopt and help (another) child in the system, but a little piece of me would still be lost knowing I couldn't look down on the child I made and see little things where they resemble me or my husband. Now, I've had people say \"why don't you not worry about having your own and just adopt, there are so many kids out there that already need help.\" When I hear that, I understand what they mean but I also want to punch them in the face because it's like they don't understand I shouldn't feel bad for wanting my OWN child. I'm already (happily) raising a child that would have been in the system had I not taken her. How many more do I need to \"rescue\" before people stop guilt tripping me about wanting my own instead of adopting?\n\n\nAnyway, just kind of ranting and throwing everything out there. I have my hysteroscopy/D&amp;C followup on April 6 so I guess I'll kind of see where I stand at that point in terms of the health of my uterus and where I can go from there.

I went in for the ultrasound yesterday (I'm on HRT so no cycle days for me).
