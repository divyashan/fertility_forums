I put it off for a week and half, and I almost no showed on the appointment because I just couldn't stomach the idea of being poked, prodded and heartbroken again, at least not any time soon.\n\nI am happy to report that the appointment went better than expected.  I was worried that Doc B would suggest I participate in the Infertility Gauntlet, you know, IUI's, Clomid, Ferma, IVF, Donor Eggs etc, but he didn't.  It turns out that I was afraid that my doctor and I weren't on the same page, but we are smack dab in the middle of the same sentence together.\n\nWe both believe that given my relative ease in conception and recurrent early losses, along with the data from my RPL that my ANA Titer is the likely culprit.  Basically that my bodies immune system keeps attacking the pregnancies, and that I may have a clotting issue.  So this isn't really news to me (or perhaps you if you've been following me) but I was pleased that he feels that the best way to combat it is through a surrogate.  \n\nNow I know that for some people, that would be devastating news, but emotionally this was the best response for me, because I feel like I have attempted a series of not-enjoyable-fixes that haven't fixed the problem.  (and I believe that's because ultimately my immune system is the problem)  We talked about things that are done at times to work on immune systems, and much like the belief that progesterone can prevent miscarriage, it's more speculative than correlative.  Now please don't think that means I'm dismissing it, I think it is certainly worth trying every avenue you are comfortable with, and I certainly don't see any harm, but for me personally (and I am only speaking for myself) I feel like doing more invasive treatments will only diminish my mental health.\n\nSo he proposed that we have 4 choices (with the knowledge that it could always be my eggs, TBD)\n\n1.  Continue Natural cycles with blood thinners and progesterone after a positive pregnancy test.  We discussed starting earlier, he said I could if I want to, it wont harm me (physically), but that in my case, it would be unlikely to remedy the problem.\n\n2.  Surrogate with me doing a round of IVF\n\n3.  Adopt\n\n4.  Nothing\n\n\nI cannot begin to express how comforting I found his candor.  Money continues to be a top concern, and I feel too much guilt over that as it is, so to have a frank conversation about realistic possibilities for me, my anxiety actually took a break.\n\n\nSo now I find myself in this new sort of limbo, my husband would like to try naturally awhile longer, and I respect his rational and his process, we all go through it at different rates and in different ways, and he respects that ultimately I will decide when I can no longer handle the roller-coaster that is recurrent loss.\n\nThis will give us some time, time to heal, time to save money and time to reconnect.  I'm not going into any natural cycles with the expectation that I will get a different result, and I have made peace with my body and I'm trying to make peace with my own guilt over microchoices from the past.\n\nThis is an interesting place to be.  I feel as if life has granted me a pool noodle and for the first time in 2.5 years I'm not just treading water, but I'm not out of the storm yet.\n\nJust thought I'd share, and please I encourage all of you, take care of yourself, be kind to yourself, the grief of infertility is larger than us all.\n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Different Sort of Limbo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3s53p4/a_different_sort_of_limbo/"}, {"author": "anonymous2278", "author_created_utc": 1434157847, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_o2riz", "created_utc": 1447082567, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3s542w/can_i_use_overthecounter_monistat_four_days_after/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3s542w", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3s542w/can_i_use_overthecounter_monistat_four_days_after/", "retrieved_on": 1450673639, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm prone to yeast infections, I get them anytime something new is introduced into my vaginal area.

Took 7 months to get RE appointment, get tests arranged (not a full-service clinic), schedule treatment. \n\nFirst diagnosis: MFI - 2% morphology due to Anti-Sperm Antibodies (and lowish count and motility). Nothing to do to fix the morphology. I was surging every month and seemed fine. No-one cared that my luteal phases were short (10-11 days post-surge).\n\nFirst treatment: Two unmedicated IUIs. First resulted in small CP (13 at 13DPIUI, 26 at 15DPIUI, then fell). Second had nothing.\n\nWe move cities. Took a few months for testing and scheduling. Treatment cancelled when a fluke CP shifted my cycles too far for the small window I had in my school program to do IVF. Levels, days unknown: 35, 73, 120, 140, fell. \n\nWe move cities again (yay). Took a few months for testing and scheduling. \n\nSecond treatment: Short IVF cycle. Mild OHSS. 11 mature eggs retrieved, 9 fert, 2 Day 3 8-3 embryos frozen (some eggs had dark cytoplasm, some were multinucleated, some just arrested). It took 6 months for the fall out of that - one FET (beta simply negative), then delays, then second embryo did not survive thawing. \n\nThird treatment: 3 back-to-back unstimmed but progesterone-supported IUIs. Middle one had third CP, beta of 7 at 16DPIUI. \n\nQuick turn-around to fourth treatment: Long IVF protocol. Much easier recovery. 7 mature eggs, 7 fertilized, ALL multinucleated. Died off between Days 3 and 5. No transfer. \n\nLeading to Friday's follow-up. \n\nThe doctor is stumped. She has no idea why I'm not making embryos with IVF. She's ordered karyotyping for both of us (which I asked for after the third CP and she dissuaded us since she doesn't consider CPs to be diagnostically relevant but does consider poor IVF response to be). She is very clear that she doesn't know why this is happening and she doesn't know what the best move is. \n\nI mentioned in the daily thread that she obliquely referenced donor eggs. It was very indirect but it put them on my radar. It was part of a speech about how they can't actually trace cause and effect in predictable ways 100% of the time: \n\n* She must have used a word like \"special\" or \"unique\" half a dozen times.\n\n* They don't know why giving stims in small quantities to make a single follicle in women who ALREADY make single follicles does increase pregnancy rates. \n\n* She doesn't know general lifestyle-related ways of increasing my egg quality.\n\n* She told a story of another patient to illustrate how they don't know why certain treatments work: This patient made PGSed perfect embryos no problem but could.not.get.pregnant. The thing that worked was switching to donor eggs. The doctor has NO IDEA WHY.\n\nThat last point was the oblique reference. The realization that if they can't solve the problem using the gametes we're giving them, they are going to suggest donor gametes because they don't know enough about fixing my gametes. \n\nI guess I had a mental block that it could be a female factor they couldn't solve because I've been ovulating on my own this whole time and have a huge egg reserve (42 on the Canadian scale) and I was an over-responder to 125IU of Gonal-F. I am just so stunned that my eggs could be unusable without some warning before now. \n\nI'm really upset that they don't know more about fixing egg quality. She told me I could visit a naturopath for further ideas. This did not sit well with me; I don't know how it works where I live but there are plenty of places where \"naturopath\" or even \"naturopathic doctor\" is not a protected term or is not held to any kind of standard. I lump naturopathy in with alternative medicine and homeopathy when it comes to self-policing by a body I can trust (and my attitude there is, if it worked, it would become real medicine, like how \"willow bark tea\" is aspirin). Just look at the fact that that woman who made her children suffer through whooping cough is allowed to call herself a naturopath. \n\nThe worst part is that many things people say they go to naturopaths for are things I can get behind -- preventative medicine and treating our bodies better. Of course you feel like shit; you only eat prepackaged food and you sleep 5 hours a night. Try eating yogurt daily if you get yeast infections. Gargling twice a day has actually been found to reduce the frequency and length of colds in randomized trials. But also, GET FUCKING VACCINATED OR ELSE YOU ARE A DANGER TO SOCIETY. I just feel like that kind of stuff should be covered by a family doctor who is guaranteed to take a science-based approach and can look out for warning signs of something more serious. \n\nI pushed back immediately when she said I should see a naturopath to check my vitamin levels. I said \"I prefer my medicine to be science-based. If it's possible vitamins can be a factor in fertility, why doesn't that fall under the purview of a reproductive endocrinologist?\" She said it's because she just never studied it, and I could see a family doctor instead if I was more comfortable. \n\nSo now I'm in the hell of unexplained. No idea of what's wrong, so no clear way forward. \n\nIf we end up back at IVF, she said she would switch me back to the short protocol. Her definition of success is ONLY \"how many transferable embryos made it\" not \"how bad were the side effects\" or even some measure of egg count or quality. She would reduce the meds a bit to still try that \"concentrate the quality\" trick of lower egg counts, but I'm terrified of being so sick for so long again. \n\nBut a) we're waiting on the karyotyping first, and b) I am not able to bring myself to spend that much money again so soon without exhausting other options by backtracking. I sort of tried to skip ahead to IVF to \"buy time\" but even if that's not working, I can't stop trying.\n\nI got the feeling that she wouldn't continue to recommend IVF if we kept having such a crap response. Mr. mL didn't. He didn't feel different at all after the appointment; I feel completely destroyed. I thought that she would say \"just keep trying IVF while we try different protocols\" but her complete confusion was totally demoralizing.\n\n**NEXT TREATMENT:** She's letting us go \"back\" to medicated IUIs which we have never tried. She's putting me on a teeny dose of Gonal-F to make a super-follicle but she'll still be aiming for a single follicle. We're even allowed to start before we get karyotyping back, which is good because this means we can squeeze in a cycle before Christmas. My Day 1 is any day now, so it looks like cycle, Christmas, next cycle by mid-January. We'll buy a three-pack of IUIs so that we can bash out a bunch of repeated attempts (being mathematicians, we have faith in medium odds; we just know that you might need to roll the die a bunch more to finally get it to turn up). We can get pregnant on IUIs (2 out of 5 worked!) so it'll be a case of seeing if we can get them to stick. \n\nI'm really anti-baby-dust and becoming anti-luck-wishing. I'll be very glad to have a sympathetic ear here, though, and I can't express how important it is to be not alone.

Now I'm sitting in my office and I have a ton of work to do today and I am struggling to hold back the tears.\n\nI am literally the only guy I know who always *wanted* to have a kid, whose main goal in life was to have a family. My friends always thought I was weird, I never cared, I just wanted a child, or two, or several, ever since I was in my early teens. Why me? Why couldn't this curse afflict one of my \"I refuse to bring another person into this shitty world\" friends?\n\nI feel broken and useless. I know there are other things in life, but for me being a father is one of the defining goals. I cannot, I don't even want to imagine a life without children. I feel like nobody around me, not even my wife, understands just how important this is to me. It is the most natural thing a man can do, to pass on his knowledge and values, to set a good example, and to leave a mark on this world. The only person I have talked to about this has suggested adoption, \"oh but you would love them anyway, my cousin has adopted a child and they're so happy\", but I couldn't do that. To me blood is every bit as important as upbringing. I don't want to adopt. I want a child of my own. I don't want to wait another five months before we try ICSI. I'm tired of waiting. Every day that passes is one less day of my life that I will get to spend with my children, and my parents aren't exactly getting younger either and I know how much they would love to have a grandchild. I'm tired of forcing myself to have sex because \"we have to\". I'm tired of feeling hurt and envious every goddamn time I see a man or a woman with a baby or a toddler. I'm tired of this damn 28-31 day roller coaster. I'm frankly quite tired of being sexually frustrated, to the point of hardly being able to think about anything else, during the week before she ovulates because I have to \"save ammo\". I'm tired of taking Carnitine, Arginine, CoQ12, Omega 3 fatty acids, folic acid, Selenium, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, zinc, over a dozen fucking pills and tablets and capsules every day. I'm just fucking tired.\n\n\nEdit: sometimes the old remedies work. I just put on some Black Sabbath, and suddenly I feel more angry than hurt. It's like being 17 all over again.\n\nEdit 2: I've said it before, I'll say it again: **of all the places you'd rather never be, this subreddit has to be among the very best**. It's amazing how kind and helpful and understanding everyone here is. With all the negativity there is in this world in general and on the internet in particular, I feel this really should not be taken for granted. **Thanks everyone, you're amazing**.

Maybe I\u2019m not using the right terms.  \n\n**TL;DR:  Looking for any thoughts, experiences, insight, etc. about back-to-back retrieval cycles.  I just got my protocol for IVF #1, and my details are below, for anyone who's interested, or if that info is relevant to your options.  Thanks, all.**\n\nBackground:\n*39 1/2 years old.  \n*Had both tubes removed via salpingectomy on 10/2 of double hydrosalpinx.  \n*Started bc on 10/3, and just received my protocol today.  \n*Starting Ganirelix on 11/15 and will take that and the bc pills until 11/18.  \n*First ultrasound and estradiol test on 11/19.  \n*Begin stimming on 11/22.  Menopur (two powder vials) in the morning and Follistim (150 IU\u2019s) in the evening for 8-14 days prior to retrieval.  \n*Once my largest follicle is 12-14mm, I\u2019ll take Ganirelix again every evening until Ovidrel trigger shot (this seems to be in addition to continuing the Menopur and Follistim).\n\n*Likely retrieval between 12/1 and 12/7.\n\n*AMH: 1.51 (first test in March was 0.4, but RE thinks that was wrong, a lab problem)\n*FSH: 9\n*Estradiol: 66\n*Antral follicle count: 6 on right, 8 on left.\n\nOkay, so for the back-to-back retrieval:\n\nWe are going through Attain and are purchasing their two-cycle plan.  But we are also doing PGS testing, which is a separate cost, and the fee is close to $3000 for up to eight embryos.  So one embryo or eight, we\u2019re paying the same.  If we do back-to-back cycles/retrievals and send our best embryos from both those retrievals, we\u2019ll be saving ourselves quite a bit of money (I\u2019m not expecting eight viable embryos, but if by some miracle we get way more than expected, we\u2019d send the best quality eight.)  \n\nThese are my thoughts on why this makes sense:\n\n*I\u2019m going to be 40 next April, so I feel like every month counts and the sooner we do this, the better.\n\n*There\u2019s a possibility we will relocate cross country sometime next year, and I\u2019d rather not have to switch clinics for second IVF round.  \n\n*I think I\u2019d like to know exactly what we\u2019re looking as to how many embryos we get and their quality, etc., rather than wondering what the second round will/would have yielded.  It sucks to have to wait so much longer for the PGS, but I think the trade off will be worth it.  \n\nQuestions:\n\n*Has anyone else done this before?  What was your experience?  Problems?  Positives?  Outcome?\n\n*How long did you have to wait between retrievals?\n\n*I\u2019m sure there are a ton of things I don\u2019t know about yet/haven\u2019t thought of, so I\u2019d just appreciate any insight about this.  \n\nMany thanks!\n\nEDIT: Added antral follicle count", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Has anyone done back-to-back IVF cycles/retrievals?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3scf2u/has_anyone_done_backtoback_ivf_cyclesretrievals/"}, {"author": "Sassy_Pants24", "author_created_utc": 1423762546, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_lbicj", "created_utc": 1447211000, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sd0t7/holiday_cards/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3sd0t7", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3sd0t7/holiday_cards/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "cOI5jzXUFJTBq1C3Gk5r0tvKZzwnpoIx6AWn2fpEAgY", "resolutions": [{"height": 12, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/GytU2t02KOHZV-inBOC9cdh5WjBjDYlB8KFWN3llnW8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=1da8704a125f4990dbb6576894837726", "width": 108}, {"height": 25, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/GytU2t02KOHZV-inBOC9cdh5WjBjDYlB8KFWN3llnW8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=21a3434c8261a46d03bdbef0e59543e7", "width": 216}, {"height": 38, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/GytU2t02KOHZV-inBOC9cdh5WjBjDYlB8KFWN3llnW8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=ef2708cc3cff8a24179153b5277d06a3", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 58, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/GytU2t02KOHZV-inBOC9cdh5WjBjDYlB8KFWN3llnW8.jpg?s=e9d11033bc5855c44e988ece57455fe7", "width": 485}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1450669879, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nWith the holidays coming up I just thought I'd share some info on holiday cards that go towards a great cause.

I am not very good at expressing myself, but I will give it a shot..\n\nA year of ttc with PCOS and no success lead us to discover, after months of a doctor insisting it was lab issues, that my husband has zero sperm. Non-obstructive azoospermia, and we're told micro-tese is our only hope, and even that apparently isnt very likely? We're waiting on a fertility specialist/ urologist referral, but that will likely take months just to get a consult.\n\nEven if we are lucky enough to find sperm, now that Ontario will be funding IVF soon, it may take years to schedule anything due to wait lists and increased interest. My husband will turn 40 in 3 years. I feel like the longer we wait the less chance of success we would have, but we're stuck waiting. (I realize that we are lucky to have the opportunity of IVF funding, but wait lists are estimated to be up to 7-8 years and may be triaged to allow patients with best odds for success first, private IVF will likely be affected with wait times too)\n\nI just really hate all of this waiting, especially when in the meantime I, momentarily, hate every single person making a pregnancy announcement. I hate that I spent last weekend sobbing over how unfair it felt that my brother just had baby #2 within 3 years, with his 40 year old wife that has a 20+ year old son from a previous marriage. I just want to be happy for people again..\n\nHow do you deal with this kind of uncertainty?

I am prepared for failure and that is what I am expecting in the coming days. Perhaps that is my coping mechanism and self survival mode, but despite whatever the outcome, I have been doing some serious soul searching. It has led to some positive discoveries despite the hell this journey has been.  I am trying to focus on the positive of this mess and not be consumed with total darkness.  As part of my healing and in hopes of helping others that are struggling, I wish to share the positives and the transformation this process is having on me as well as my husband.  I would love to hear yours too.\n\n1.  Increase in my self awareness - I have never been a navel gazer always the \"doer\" in my family.  With that I have lost myself along the way - forgetting or possibly not knowing who I am.  I have had to take a long hard look in the mirror - which can be ugly and painful.  I have learned a lot of negative things about myself - mainly my controlling nature and perfectionist tendencies.  I have also learned I am a very strong person which I never felt that I was.  I have learned my limits and I have also learned the importance of boundaries.  I don't think I had much self worth in the past but the IF process has forced me to do some major self care as well as nurturing my marriage more - even if it is purely for survival, it has strengthened my relationship with not only myself but my closest loved ones.  \n\n2.  It's heightened my sensitivity and empathy to others and the outside world.  Instead of snapping to judgements I take pause now when I pass strangers.  I wonder the struggles that person has endured or is currently enduring.  It makes me realize how resilient humans beings are.  I want to connect and nurture humanity more - its made me value what a miracle we all are and each one of us has a purpose on this Earth - no matter how insignificant we may feel.\n\n3.  I have been forced to live in the here and now.  As a planner, organizer, the control freak I always knew I was just didn't realize how much so - I am realizing how na\u00efve and stupid I really have been most of my life.  I have been too busy to enjoy the simple things in life.  I have been focused on end goals and results and not appreciating the gift of each day.  I have been missing the beauty around me.  That everything I plan for may not come to fruition and all that I have gained can be lost in a moments notice.  Its a scary realization although it forced me to slow down and lose some sense of entitlement.  \n\n4.  Seeing the fear of change and the fear of stagnation.  I fear a failed cycle yet I also fear a positive one simultaneously.  As someone that has always idealized parenting and being a mom I know if I am blessed with a child the suffering and struggle with life will continue.  It will not end my problems.  I fear the changes that come but I also fear not having those changes if we don't succeed.  The stress will not end wherever the journey ends - which brings me back to the here and now.\n\n5.  I am becoming more liberal and seeing less black and white in the world.  I see families come in all shapes and sizes.  Its not just about genes and blood relations.  Despite not having my own kids, I have my husband and my 2 golden retrievers.  I have friends that I consider family.  I have a community that is close and supportive - I enrich my friends' childrens lives as does my husband.  I am becoming more of a feminist.  I feel a stronger kinship to women and am happy we live in a time where we can be respected for our own decisions and autonomy.  I have deep respect for others that live a different life than what they have been told they should be living.  I love seeing people be authentic and comfortable taking the least walked path.  I respect individuality more and have been accepting of people with their warts and all.  \n\nThere is a lot of darkness and self wallowing I have found myself in the past few months.  I need to prevent and stop going down that rabbit hole.  I need to see the transformation this process is having on me and that it is not all negative.  This isn't what I expected life to be like, but I can't say I fully regret it.  It has opened doors for me - to see this big picture in this crazy thing called life.  And who knows maybe I will get to know me more and not be so scared of that.  In the end I am stuck with me regardless who is around me - I guess it's better to try and become friends.  I would love to hear who you have become through this and who you hope to become.

We tried a private clinic but at $400 a pop for just the consultations and only getting 20% back through insurance, we couldn't afford it. The treatment itself was in tens of thousands.\n\nTwo months ago I had all the blood tests and scans done, and the fertility specialist told us bluntly that we are not a candidate for IVF because I am going through early menopause (I'm 42) and would require a donor egg, which is a service their clinic does not offer. The only symptom I have is irregular periods since I've been trying to conceive, but I accepted that she was the specialist and took that as a fact. At the time that I got the blood test I hadn't had my period for four months which is the longest I've gone overdue. So I just thought I was one of the 'lucky' ones that just jumps straight into menopause without any side-affects.\n\nAlso these blood tests stated my glucose was high and bordering on being diagnosed with Type II diabetes, iron levels were low enough to go on iron &amp; Vitamin C supplements straight away (despite being a carrier for haemochromatosis!), calcium &amp; Vitamin D were low, and something else that indicated I had received a blood transfusion but I never have (that one is very baffling!). I get annual blood tests and this is the first time I've had results like this so it was a big shock. I just assumed it was part of the menopause screwing my body around.\n\nI stopped checking my ovulation cycle, stopped taking folate, switched back to my regular blood pressure medication that is not good for pregnancy but works better than the alternative, and I also stopped watching my diet. My period returned two weeks later and the last two cycles were normal and on time.\n\nI went back and told my regular GP. She ordered another round of tests as she was very doubtful that I was menopausal. Everything came back normal, even my iron and sugar levels. I asked why the other blood test would have been so different and she said that sometimes this just happens.\n\nSo - does anybody have an opinion on this? Ever happened to you? I'm even wondering if the pathologists had somehow mixed up my test results....is that even possible??  But I don't know. What else could cause those abnormal results? I didn't think I was stressed or anxious at all but maybe I was and in denial about it. Don't know.

I hope you guys have ideas or experience to share that can help me make the best decision. \n\nMy family is pretty big and pretty close. I have aunts on both sides of the family who struggled with infertility. Both sets of grandparents are aware of our TTC struggles. My four siblings have been pretty supportive and patient, two of them have children of their own. They aren't perfect and often say the wrong thing, but they do try to understand what I'm going through so I'm  proud of them for that. \n\nIt has been almost two years since our last fertility-related doctor visit. Six years TTC, eight married, together 12 years this Sunday. We've spent the last two years saving up and working on \"us\" and are now finally ready to do our first round of IVF. I have unexplained IF, my husband's SA's have been normal every time.. maybe slightly below avg morphology but that's it. All the tests that have been done on me have produced no answers of any kind. Our dr is very optimistic that IVF + ICSI will work for us. I'm not allowing myself to be quite that hopeful, I've chosen to go into this as if it's another diagnostic procedure only. \n\nSo I am conflicted about whether or not to tell anyone besides my parents that we are finally doing IVF. I would love to be able to surprise people with good news, but would of course hate to have to deliver bad news. I would love to have a little bit of privacy for once, to see how we do in going through this mostly on our own, and to be able to grieve privately if this attempt fails. But I would also hate to hurt anyone's feelings when they find out they've been kept out of the loop, when most of them have been so supportive and aware of me thus far. And with all the hormonal gunk that's going to be coming my way via the injections, I may find that I really need to be able to talk to my family about it. But we have holiday celebrations coming up, which will be held at my brother and SIL's home this year, and I don't know how I'd go about concealing the refrigerated meds in their fridge. \n\nHow have you handled this in the past?

It's been a few months since I posted.  I'm mostly here to vent but also wanted to see if anyone else has had these particular issues.\n\nI had my ER in mid-July with the intention of doing a FET with the next cycle.  In August, a hysteroscopy revealed an issue that needed to be surgically removed and turned out to be adenomeiosis.  My RE said I'd need to wait until the next cycle to give my uterine lining time to recover.  \n\nDuring the September cycle, 2 days before my scheduled transfer date, my RE said she didn't like the character of my lining and that she wanted to be extra cautious given my pre-IVF miscarriage history.  She thought that maybe my lining still needed more time to recover from the surgery in August.  \n\nForward to October -- RE put me on a different protocol to theoretically help my lining.  I started with BCP, then added Lupron.  Then my ultrasound revealed that I was ovulating through.  RE canceled my cycle and said to continue on Lupron to hold my place in the protocol, then I can proceed to stim meds when I start my period.  That was 4.5 weeks ago.  Still no period.  I go in twice a week for scans and bloodwork.  The follicular cyst is still huge, but my estrogen levels finally started dropping -- then the estrogen kind of stalled around 100 (needs to be &lt;50), so today, RE said we'll do a procedure next week to drain the cyst, which should help the estrogen continue going down.  \n\nAt this rate, we're looking at a mid-December transfer at earliest.  4 months of delays, but coming just a couple of weeks at a time.  Everything in my life has felt like it's on hold because we keep thinking the transfer is a short while away.  E.g., haven't booked a long weekend trip in case I start my period the night before we leave and then can't get into my RE's office until CD5.  We've decided that if there's another canceled cycle, we're taking a break for a few months, going on a proper trip, and letting my body recover from all the meds and miscarriages (my last normal cycle was in February -- since then, it's been chemical pregnancy, pregnancy until 11 weeks, D&amp;C, IVF retrieval, start meds until cycle gets canceled, repeat last step 4x).\n\nAnyone else have any of these issues?\n\n**TL;DR**: Adenomeiosis, uterine lining had poor character, I'm a super-ovulator but my period refuses to start.

A bit of context: We got pregnant on our last cycle and had what my husband and I call a \"double miscarriage.\" We had a lot of bleeding, an ER doc said we had a miscarriage, then a week later my fertility clinic said the pregnancy was fine. Then two weeks later we were told the embryo had stopped growing and had no heartbeat. So we told our parents we were pregnant, then told them we miscarried, then told them we were pregnant again, and then told them we miscarried again. All within about four weeks. So ... that was awful. \n\nWith this cycle, I don't want to have a bunch of people waiting on our results. I don't want to feel like I have to give a report out to the entire Noodle clan. But lying is too difficult. Mr. Noodle (Lord Noodle?) thought we could just say I had the flu on Thanksgiving, but I don't think that will work.  \n\nThoughts? xoxo\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Telling parents that you're doing another cycle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3spi6b/telling_parents_that_youre_doing_another_cycle/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1447452134, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sppy9/pros_and_cons/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3sppy9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3sppy9/pros_and_cons/", "retrieved_on": 1450663885, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "What was good this week?

I've been lurking for a while and have gotten a lot out of reading these posts. I'm feeling a little defeated and am hoping you all can tell it to me straight. What is the likelihood that having a hysteroscopy to remove uterine polyps will help me get and more importantly stay pregnant?\n\nHere's my story: I'm 42 and have really super sucky AMH levels. I only got married at 39 immediately stopped birth control hoping to start a family. 2 years went by and I figured I had waited too long and that we would never get pregnant. I was at peace with that. Then, at 41 I found myself pregnant. I was very excited until my 8 week appointment where we discovered there was no heartbeat. About 5 months later I was pregnant again but that turned out to be a blighted ovum. Because of my age, it was suggested that I see a RE. I did not make the appointment thinking I want to get pregnant at any cost. I just wanted too see if there was something else we could be doing. \n\nAfter re-running labs and making sure all my parts were in good working order, my doctor determined I have uterine polyps and advocated that I get them removed. I was reluctant but willing until I found out that they weren't going to be able to schedule me for another 2 months. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by all the appointments this process has required and now I'm starting to feel like none of this is going to help. I'm old, I waited too long and these hoops they're having me jump through are leading me nowhere. I know you all are not my doctor and I do have a pending request to talk to her, but what do you think? Is having some benign polyps removed really going to help my 40-something uterus sustain life?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Will a hysteroscopy actually help anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3spzna/will_a_hysteroscopy_actually_help_anything/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1447457451, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sq14e/will_a_hysteroscopy_actually_help_anything/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3sq14e", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3sq14e/will_a_hysteroscopy_actually_help_anything/", "retrieved_on": 1450663740, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Will a hysteroscopy actually help anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sq14e/will_a_hysteroscopy_actually_help_anything/"}, {"author": "VieilleSacoche", "author_created_utc": 1444510079, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "36, stage IV endometriosis, IVF #1 (freeze-all), FET Feb 2016", "author_fullname": "t2_r30cf", "created_utc": 1447464694, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sqcc5/why_are_mens_rooms_in_ivf_clinics_so_awful/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3sqcc5", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 33, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3sqcc5/why_are_mens_rooms_in_ivf_clinics_so_awful/", "retrieved_on": 1450663595, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "My husband and I (based in the UK) are going through our first IVF cycle, so every part of the process has been a learning experience. Whilst most clinic appointments have been as good as can be expected, I'm utterly appalled at the conditions that men have to put up with when it comes to providing a sperm sample on site - especially on egg collection day.\n\nHow any man, let alone one who's supported his partner through the stimming process, been at the clinic since early morning, and has the worry of his partner undergoing a surgical procedure, can be expected to ejaculate on cue in little more than a broom cupboard with no soundproofing and only dog-eared copies of Razzle for encouragement is utterly beyond me. That's not even considering the ridiculously tiny plastic pot.\n\nIt seems as if this 50% share of the embryo creation process is treated as little more than a necessary irritation. I know this may seem like a strong reaction, but given the vast amount of money charged for each cycle and the effort put into ensuring the best outcome for women, I can't believe that so little thought is given to the male partner's experience.\n\nOf course the female partner has to go through the daily injections, intrusive scans, major physical and psychological side-effects and surgical procedures, and I'm not in any way diminishing this, rather I would've expected more effort to be made to support men. In my own experience, whilst undergoing IVF is way tougher than I could've expected, this is mitigated somewhat by the constant medical attention. My husband had to deal with his own stress about the process and look after me as well, but with only a fraction of the back-up.\n\nI know that everyone's opinion of porn is different, but as a bare minimum I would've expected the provision of a private, comfortable room, a selection of new, decent mags and videos and an 'anatomically-accommodating' receptacle for the sample. I was definitely apprehensive about egg collection, but wouldn't have changed places with my husband for anything. \n\nUltimately, I wish the clinics would grow up and accept that making babies is inextricably linked to sex, and enable both partners to have as stress-free an experience as possible.\n\nRant over. Thanks for reading.\n\nI really look forward to hearing anybody's thoughts on this!\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why are 'men's rooms' in IVF clinics so awful?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sqcc5/why_are_mens_rooms_in_ivf_clinics_so_awful/"}, {"author": "Potapka", "author_created_utc": 1438465372, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "35F, unexplained, IVF#1 ongoing, fucking 2WW", "author_fullname": "t2_p8r2d", "created_utc": 1447472192, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3sqqcr/ivf_insurance_and_meds_cluster/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3sqqcr", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3sqqcr/ivf_insurance_and_meds_cluster/", "retrieved_on": 1450663413, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Guys, I need some help - I think I just leveled up. We are unexplained (AMH - 1.64 and husband's morphology - 4% were of some concern, but OK otherwise). After 6 months of trying I decided to get organized, talked to my insurance, got assigned a reproductive nurse/consultant, and learned that we have something like 1.5 IVF worth lifetime cap (treatment and meds). After a bit of diagnostics, we decided to go forward with IVF, because I felt like $$/success rate looked better, at least until we eat through the insurance money. I made triple OK with my insurance consultant that going directly to IVF was not a problem. So now I am on track to IVF, been on birth control for 2 months (and not happy about it), supposed to start stimming next Saturday, and ER Nov 30th. I've had a back-and-forth with the clinic-insurance-Caremark pharmacy for about a month now, they never seemed to have talked to each other effectively. So today, week before I am supposed to start stimming, I got a final decision letter from the insurance saying that they are not going to pay for Menopur and Follistim, because I have not done three cycles of Clomid beforehand. Now I know this is peanuts compared to what a lot of you deal with, but I have not budgeted for random -$4,000 and have not been this close to crying at work yet. I checked with the insurance consultant and she was able to tell me only that the \"treatment\" branch of insurance and \"meds\" branch of insurance simply do not talk to each other (the good news is that \"treatment\" branch of insurance is still willing to go ahead with the IVF). I just don't know what to do. Nobody is going to talk to me during the weekend anyway, so thinking time. The way I see it:\nOption #1 - suck it up and absorb the 4k, probably more, but get the cycle going (getting IF treatment and house down-payment in the same year was too optimistic anyways, right?). Of course this happened in the midst of the great Bravelle recall, but I take all and any tips for discount meds that deliver really fast.\nOption #2 - get mad, drop everything, and probably lose 1k (we paid $500 of IVF \"down-payment\" and they are gonna charge us another $500 for cancelation, if I manage to get the whole thing dropped EOD Monday, $1000 after. There was other stuff like \"pre-op exam\" for the ER this week and I cannot probably get our of my baseline ultrasound on Monday at 7:30 am.\nOption #3  - (which is an option if the clinic choses to works with us) pushing as much money and treatment as we can, from what we already spent, towards IUI with Clomid (I am not even sure how would that work with the fact that I am on the bloody BC still). I believe that's about 7% success rate and 2k (our clinic, the only clinic in the state supported by our insurance, does Clomid only with monitoring and IUI for just that much), but after we get three bloody (heh) cycles done, we qualify for our insurance to pay the meds and probably still have enough money for IVF before we reach the cap.\nI would definitely appreciate any thoughts.

It sucks and it's shitty, but my last \"one egg wonder\" made it to transfer but didn't stick. So I know theres somewhat of a chance. But I have some general-ish questions for you guys. I felt like I was about to ovulate a couple of days ago. I went for blood and sono and they said they were worried because my LH was rising and I was trying to ovulate. They put me on ganirelix and the next day (yesterday) the blood work came back saying that my LH was leveling out. My doctor yesterday told me (before the blood came back) that my follicle was a 22.5 and they would probably call and tell me to come in today for either an IUI or IVF retrieval. He left for the weekend and my old doctor took over without them telling me. He said he wanted to stretch me one more day since my LH was leveling out. I took a ganirelix yesterday morning and did a trigger at midnight last night with a 10:30 retrieval tomorrow morning. I have a gut feeling that it's way too late and I might be ovulating now. I'm cramping so bad. Even my own doctor thought today would be my retrieval day so I'm not sure why they pushed me for one more day. And I asked why my retrieval was so late in the day and they told me it was because I was their only patient and they were going to let the staff sleep in a bit. Am I being paranoid or does something seem wrong? I don't want my old doctor to do the procedure but I don't really have a choice. He even told the nurses to tell me today that there are no hard feelings. I just don't trust him anymore since he screwed up so badly my first two cycles. What do you guys think?

She likes to play hide and seek, or \u201ccatch me if you can\u201d. Or is it a he? I\u2019m not exactly sure, but I speak to him or her. I think of him or her. All the time. I imagine what she would look like, what it would feel like to have him snuggle up on my lap, or in between Corey and I on the couch, or how it would be to have her tucked inside a snugglie inside my coat on a crisp Saturday walk about the city. I think of how soft his hair is, the colour a meeting place between Corey\u2019s brown and my blonde, her eyes the perfect blend of green and blue. I think of how he would be the perfect fit for this silent space we made for her.\n\nMissing someone you have never met is the strangest thing. It occupies every nook and cranny, fills in all the dark corners you can never reach, the muscles you didn\u2019t even know were there until they started to hurt. Soon enough, you are walking around your everyday with an aching, throbbing pain deep inside your chest that isn\u2019t easy to talk about, that not everyone understands, that not even you can understand. I never thought I would be this way. When I was in my early twenties, so principled and thinking myself so world-aware, if the topic of fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization ever came up, I would say dismissively at the television or radio or to whoever was listening, \u201cif a woman can\u2019t get pregnant *naturally*, then she should just adopt. The universe is trying to send her a message.\u201d And yet here I am, fifteen or so years later, with an acute awareness that has come with time, experience and heartbreak, that that 20 year old woman simply didn\u2019t know what the fuck she was talking about. At the same time, a part of me misses being that person, and wishes that it still felt that simple, that black and white. I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I have let things get more complicated, that those early disappointments started to soften the edges and blur the lines. I wish it felt like the universe was actually talking to me. I stand outside in the dark and there is nothing there. \n\nFor many years now we have been trying to coax him out into the world. Or her. It\u2019s been six years, almost seven, and I hate that I am counting, or that I even have to count. All it does is make the missing her part even more excruciating. There have been a few times, a few glimmers of hope, where it seemed that we might actually meet. Positive tests and hormones rising, but in my heart I always knew the persistent bleeding was a bad sign. \u201cIt happens sometimes, don\u2019t worry,\u201d but I knew. Your gut will speak to you if you listen, or sometimes you don\u2019t even have to listen, it just taps at your shoulder incessantly. \n\nI am not one of those women whose reproductive system is some kind of trustworthy thing, some beautiful mystery of womanhood, tucked inside their bellies, ready to spring into action. I am not someone who never had to think about it, or who got pregnant by accident. I am not someone who has ever had that part of my body function normally. It is a part of my body that has been poked and prodded by countless doctors, laparoscopic surgeries to scrape and cauterize and remove any signs of endometriosis, hormones prescribed in an effort to will my menstrual cycle into submission. The pain has been unbearable at times. \u201cWell, we only consider it severe pain if you are bringing yourself to the ER,\u201d a doctor once said to me. I was dumbfounded. Countless memories came to mind of me curled up and moaning in bed, in seething pain. Carting myself up to the ER, where I could curl and moan and breath through my teeth while sitting on a hard plastic chair in the waiting room for hours until someone might actually see me, is the very last thing I would want to do while in that amount of pain. \u201cShe has to self-medicate,\u201d my husband tried. \u201cShe takes pain medication and drinks scotch. She\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d The doctor nodded blankly, unmoved. \n\nI knew it might take us a little longer in light of this. I knew that my body might give us a fight. And indeed it has. More poking and prodding, jabbing needles stuffed with hormones into my body, and don\u2019t even get me started on the number of times I have had a dildo-shaped ultrasound wand rammed up into my vagina. My body has felt anything but a fertile place. It has felt like an empty and often very lonely place.  Over time, my feelings about infertility have become so tangled. Once you start down the path of trying to solve the problem, you get further and further into the weeds until finally you look around and realize you\u2019ve walked much further into the muck than you told yourself you would. And yet, you keep walking because something in you tells you that thing you are looking for could be just up ahead. Just there. See? You can almost see it. And so you keep going, for a while at least. There has to be an end point somewhere, whether it\u2019s a financial one or an emotional one or just a line drawn on your mental calendar. Otherwise, it truly drives you mad. Still, though, it is never that simple. That end point hovers over me, taunting me, and in some ways puts even more pressure on me. *This is your last chance to lose ten pounds and see if it\u2019s the magic key. Better deal with that stress now because it can\u2019t be helping your chances. Are you sure you are eating all the right things, and not eating all the wrong things? Are you taking all the right supplements? Are you sure?*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A short piece of writing I found in my files", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3t08mz/a_short_piece_of_writing_i_found_in_my_files/"}, {"author": "greenmangosfool", "author_created_utc": 1430017502, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_n4ntf", "created_utc": 1447683903, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/3t0urf/introduction/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3t0urf", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 38, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/3t0urf/introduction/", "retrieved_on": 1450658608, "score": 11, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been reading awhile for the helpful information and figured it was finally time to introduce myself more formally. My wife and I are both 29 now and have been together since we were 19.\n\nWhen my wife was 20, she was diagnosed with PCOS and told (wrongly) that she would never be able to have children. Even though we weren't married then and hadn't even been thinking about kids yet, she was devastated and left in tears. We now know that there are many options and treatments that have been successful for women with PCOS, but at the time we were so young and didn't question it.\n\nFast forward five years to 2011 and we are getting married and it's at this point that we both started trying, gradually. I know it sounds weird to put it that way but that's because it was weird. We started using contraception only intermittently and then not at all. She started tracking her cycles and we both started watching for the start of each period and for fertile signs. But nether of us said anything about it to each other - if we didn't admit that we were trying, then we weren't failing. I know it sounds stupid, but keep in mind at this point we still thought that she didn't even really have a shot at conceiving naturally anyway.\n\nFinally, in January 2015, after four years of this, my wife found out unexpectedly that she was pregnant. We were still trying without acknowledging it but had long ago given up hope that it would actually happen. The pregnancy progressed well until 19 weeks, when my wife went into sudden preterm labor and our son was delivered 3/29/2015 at 6:27 PM. He was technically not born alive because he did not take a breath on his own, but he still had a heartbeat and was still moving when he was born. He was alive by my definition and his name is Walker.\n\nIt is now going on eight months since he passed and we have had no luck conceiving again. This time we are more open with our efforts, with ourselves, with each other, and with those who are close to us. My wife has been placed on metformin and we have tried three failed Clomid cycles (50, 50, 150). I am an active poster at ttcafterloss but lately it feels like a revolving door over there and my wife and I are stuck in the lobby.

The Dr. stated that he would recommend we stop trying to conceive naturally at this point for risk of an ectopic pregnancy. They suggested not wasting time and money and jump in with IVF. Aside from that both the Dr. and Nurse asked if we had considered adoption. Ovbiously a conversation like that lead us to believe there really is no other option.

She has borderline personality disorder, and has done a little DBT which has helped a bit. The cornerstone of my policy for dealing with her has always been to keep things cheerful, friendly, polite, and at all costs, make sure she has NOTHING ON ME. No actual intimacy, no personal details about me, everything always very light and topical. This has worked beautifully for years.\n\nMother-in-law lives across the country but is visiting sister-in-law nearby for a month, which yes, is excessive and weird and something terrible was bound to happen. My sister-in-law just gave me the head's up that she \"accidentally\" told MIL about our IF and MC. It is terrifying that she now has this to hold over me, blast on fb, make snide comments about, etc. I don't know for sure that she will do any of this, but it seems like a reasonable assumption that everyone including husband and sister-in-law is making along with me.\n\nTomorrow is my birthday, which as I don't need to explain to anyone here, is already depressing beyond measure and I'm just trying to ignore. Now MIL wants to get together to celebrate. I know I should just say no because I don't want to deal with it if she says something mean, but I feel so guilty and weird. She's just going to think I'm a complete asshole for saying \"no you can't celebrate my birthday\" (she won't know why I'm avoiding her, and usually I'm very cheerful about hanging out with her). I'm always all about being strategic, tactful, catching flies with honey, so pre-emptively cutting her off feels like going nuclear and a very unfamiliar way to handle her.\n\nMy family is very normal and low-key; I have zero experience managing things like this in a family and have always just tried to support my husband when he has to deal with something with her.\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Stupid family thing.
