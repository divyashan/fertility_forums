One mention of menopause in passing, and one comment about if the OP died. One sentence about congenital birth issues. I hope this covers everything that might upset anyone. If I need to add tags or anything, I will happily do so, or update the warning if anyone thinks I missed something.\n\n\nI definitely don't want anyone to feel more upset, since if you are here, you probably have some feelings to begin with. Only one unspoken moment involving a pregnant family member, but I will not dwell on it or spell it out, aside from just saying it happened.    \n\nSo, the first thing is facts: I'm 31, my husband is 29. We're coming up on our 11th anniversary. We have been trying to get pregnant for more than a decade at this point. We both really wanted children more than almost anything.\n\nSecond thing, complications: we don't have health insurance. We live in the US, and we simply can't afford it. Even if we could it wouldn't cover any sort of treatment for IF. We don't have enough income to try expensive reproductive therapy or intervention. We don't have family or friends that are in any position to help us (the only living relatives we have contact with are on my husband's side and it's his 80+ grandmother who is filling for her like third bankruptcy next month) and we don't live in any state that offers any scholarship/treatment assistance/grant money. Our financial future is pretty much the same as it was when we got married and isn't going to change any time soon. We can't adopt. We are definitely not able to move or find better jobs. My husband has a history of congenital birth issues, which only increase in pregnancy rates after pregnancy at age 30-35.\n\nThis last part is just the venting.    \n\nI am so utterly fed up. We really thought everything was going to just work out, like I'm sure most newlyweds do. At first. After the first year of actively trying, I scraped together $84 and went to the local women's clinic (sliding scale) and they did the normal pap smear and exam and said everything was fine from what they could see, and said if it hadn't happened in another year I could try to come back and they would check/test again. My husband went to try to donate sperm, to get a free count/motility consult (one of the things they offer at a place near us) and they couldn't find any issues. So we went back to trying.\n\nWe tried for the second and third years, nothing. Not even a missed period. My cycle was always super regular and I charted and temperatured like my life depended on it. We tried to make another Dr appointment, at the end of the third year, but they had changed their billing practices and we could no longer afford it. Then the unthinkable happened, his 15 year old cousin came home and had a great big announcement (you can guess I'm sure) and my heart just shattered. It felt like I was being mocked. By her, by the universe, just everything. She came back with a second announcement a year later, and at that point I just stopped speaking to that entire branch of the family. Like no contact, pretend they no longer exist, rendition-style excision.\n\nWe were in year 5 at that point, desperate and sad and I was just the lowest I've ever been in my life, up to that point. We couldn't even find out what was wrong (if anything) and whatever we were doing was not working. We are both really stubborn and decided that nothing else mattered, we were going to keep doing what everyone suggested, apps on our phones, charts, Xcel spreadsheets, diet changes, sleeping patterns, no alcohol/drugs/smoking/caffeine, etc. We talked about trying to just order sperm over the internet (and max out our only credit card) just to see if that would work! But in the end I couldn't picture not knowing who the father of my child was, or really even knowing it was anyone other than the person I had chosen to be my mate, if that makes sense. Having a baby was really, really important, but having a baby with my husband turned out to be even more vital to us than we would have thought.\n\nWe kept that brutal, rigid, almost monastic plan for 3 years. We were in hell. We fought about everything, we still loved each other an insanely huge amount and we both felt like complete failures. About three years ago (roughly married for 8 years at that point) we gave up on trying to kill ourselves, thinking maybe the stress was getting in the way. We stopped \"trying\" since that was yet another internet suggestion, \"it will happen when you give up!\"\n\nWhich brings me to today. It still hasn't happened. About 3 months ago, there was a change. My period suddenly went from being clockwork to being weird and irregular, coming once every 2-3 months. My normal ovulation cycle, again clear obvious ovulation that you could set your watch by is now odd and random. I'm genuinely beginning to wonder if I'm entering early menopause or something because I'm a hormonal mess some days, hot flashes randomly, almost like PMS, but not linked into my cycle in any meaningful way that I can see. We still don't know if there's any actual problems, we still have no way to find out and I'm terrified and so full of rage and I just don't know what to do next.\n\nI still love my husband, he still loves me, we are definitely still on the same team and we both cry now whenever we have to see some stupid social media post about someone getting everything so easily. It's impossible for us to deal with the outside world half the time. We have no contact with his extended family (again for previously stated reasons) and we have, like, ONE friend who doesn't have a wife or anything to cause us pain. We hate going to work and we never go to social events. We are kind of introverted, so that's not the end of the world. But my husband has hobbies that he wants to pursue, and I encourage that, but I make it clear I'm not going. I just won't risk it anymore. I don't want to be reminded. I don't want it rubbed in my face. I don't want to think about how this was not supposed to be my life and I would give almost anything to fix this one problem.\n\nI am definitely sorry for the whining, it's so not normally me, but today has just been a bit more than I can handle and I started hunting places to feel like I wasn't alone and I found this sub.\n\nI hate knowing that it will probably never get resolved and I've already started saying things to my husband like \"Well, maybe you should get a girlfriend, at least that way one of us might have a kid!\" or even worse \"I certainly hope if I die you prescreen future wife material in advance! She should have the resources to deal with any potential problems or at least great health insurance!\"\n\nWe both laugh about it, but I know it's painful for him to hear something like that, and I try to fight it off, but that bitterness just sinks in, right down to my bones and it feels like this lead weight now. I want to be with my husband forever, a long and happy life, I just don't know how to have a happy life that doesn't include the family we both wanted. \"Wanted\" doesn't even do that feeling justice, you know? We couldn't imagine life any other way.    \n\nThis whole decade, I don't think either of us ever gave up. We were always the best support for the other person, and we still are. I could not have picked a better life partner and I know he feels the same way (I just asked him, he confirms it) and I'm just so sad that I won't get to see him be the amazing parent I know he would be. I honestly think that is such a big part of this whole horrible situation, I feel bad for essentially keeping my soulmate from his life dream (because of course I internalize and think this has to be a \"me\" problem).\n\nI have no idea what to do next. Do we give up completely? I definitely have no interest in sex right now (for the last 2 months, at least) since it seems there is zero purpose for my stupid reproductive organs. My husband is starting to feel the same way, often now joking about it by yelling at his genitals. At least we can still sort of laugh about it together, but we both have that slightly crazed look, \"But no really, what's the point of having these things if they don't work?\" I don't want this to make us hate each other or ourselves, I just don't know how else to cope with the overwhelming terror that comes crashing in every time I think about saying, \"Ok that's it, it's never going to happen, just quit trying, learn to be happy some other way, you total wreck of a human woman.\"\n\nI don't know if I'm alone in my feels, since I've literally never tried to discuss this with anyone other than my husband in the last 9 years. I just don't know what to do anymore and I don't know if I can accept doing nothing for the rest of my life.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ok, very long post warning: mostly a vent, but any comments are welcome", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6psmv5/ok_very_long_post_warning_mostly_a_vent_but_any/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "RockyBalboa84", "author_created_utc": 1490391958, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "DOR,MFI,broke ass broad", "author_fullname": "t2_16gvx8", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501124652, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6pt7q5/journal_club_wednesday_topic_de/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6pt7q5", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6pt7q5/journal_club_wednesday_topic_de/", "retrieved_on": 1502149295, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Successful pregnancy with donor eggs in-vitro fertilization after premature ovarian insufficiency in a tertiary hospital in a low-income setting: a case report\n\n\nThomas Obinchemti Egbe1, 2Email authorView ORCID ID profile, Carine Youta Wafo3, Berthe Bebey Bollo4, Christian Pany5, Monique Jong Onomo3 and Guy Sandjon3\n\n\nFertility Research and Practice20162:12\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40738-016-0028-3\u00a9  \n\nAbstract\nBackground\n\nPremature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) is classically defined as 4\u20136 months of cessation of menses (amenorrhea) in women under 40, associated with menopausal level of serum gonadotropins FSH\u2009&gt;\u200940 IU/L and hypo-estrogenism and is also referred to as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.

The pregnancy was rocky and their marriage was worse. Fast forward 7 months and the vessel (I refuse to call her a mother) abandons her 7-month-old child and her husband. She stays gone for 10 months without any visit to her daughter. She moves out of state to be with her sister who is an escort and her brother who is in a gang and does drugs. She parties every night and calls my brother drunk off of her ass at 2 in the morning crying about how much she loves him and wants him back. My brother filed for custody and all of a sudden this bitch realizes that she has a daughter and decides to fight back. After months of visitation with the baby refusing to go with the bitch and having nightmares, we finally had court today. The baby turns two years old next month. My parents, brother, sisters, and I are all she knows. She knows who to go to if she wants a snack and which aunt gives the best bubble baths. She knows that whenever I visit I always have a treat for her, usually a sweet. She knows that grandpa is her \"papa\" and she knows that she has him wrapped around her pinky. She knows that she is the light that guides our lives. \n After being gone for 15 months the vessel is fighting for joint custody. She cried in court today, claiming that my brother beat her and she feared for her life which was why she left. The question is why didn't she take the baby with her if her life was so scary? I have never seen my brother lay a hand on her. I've seen her slap him countless number of times because he did something she thought was stupid. I have seen her beat herself and claim that my brother did it to her. I've seen her mentally and emotionally abuse him yet today in court he was the monster. And guess what my friends. The judge believed her. Because the bitch knows how to tell a story and cry. She knows how to play the victim. She knows that because she is a \"mother\" the courts are going to be more sympathetic to her. \nEven after being gone for the last 15 months and even though her daughter doesn't recognize her as her mother, she is going to get daily visitation with overnights guaranteed in a month. \nHOW THE FUCK IS THIS FAIR?!!!!!!!!!\nForget about how I feel or how my family feels, how is that innocent baby going to feel. She can't sleep without my mother singing her a lullaby and she refuses to sleep without her \"papa\" playing with her hair. She's going to think that we just left her, that we just gave her to this monster who is nothing more than an egg donor. Her vessel bitch ass disgraceful excuse for a mother already abandoned her once, she is no doubt going to do it again. Why must that baby suffer so this disgusting excuse of a human being can play \"mother\" and just leave her again when she gets bored and decides that she \"wants to live her life without any restraints\". How is it fair that she was blessed with a miracle and countless women who actually deserve children cry themselves to sleep every night because they can't have kids. How is it fair that she leaves for 15 months and now gets joint custody? How is it fair that she wanted to have an abortion when she found out she was pregnant, yet I can't even get pregnant even after 16 months of trying? How is it that women who are willing to move heaven and earth in order to have a child are tortured when worthless scum like this BITCH are just handed everything on a silver platter?  How is it fair, that just because she gave birth to a child she is considered a mother? She has no maternal bone in her body. She is narcissistic, cruel, and evil. There is a special place in hell reserved for her and anyone that believed her garbage.  FUCK HER AND FUCK ALL WORTHLESS EXCUSES OF WOMEN WHO HAVE CHILDREN YET DON'T DESERVE THE HONOR OF BEING MOTHERS.\n\nThe End...not really because damn it hurts and it isn't fair. She best pray that she doesn't hurt that little angel or there will be hell to pay. Come hell or high water, that bitch will pay if she hurts a hair on that baby's head. \nFUCKING HELL UGGGH I HATE MY LIFE.\n\nThanks for listening. I hoped that by writing this post, I would quiet the demons in my head. Now I just want to smack someone namely her. Actually, I want to do more than smack.

My husband (35) and I (going on 33 in the Fall) have been trying for about 4 years now, with only a miscarriage at around week 6-7 to show for it during the first year we were trying on our own.  When we first started trying, we were in the unexplained group--all bloodwork, SA, etc were normal. \n Over time, we have done 4 IUI's (3 letrozole, 1 natural/monitored by US/BW), we attempted to do 1 IUI with stims (75 Follistim) but I got 5 mature follicles so that cycle was cancelled.  We moved on to IVF which led to total fertilization failure, I got 6 eggs from that cycle but none fertilized though we did not do ICSI because husband has consistently had good sperm and motility, etc.  We took about a year off officially trying with medical interventions because we had a lot going on including a relocation for work, and decided to get back into treatment this year with a new clinic.  The new clinic tested my day 3 FSH during their workup and found my FSH was high for a few months, despite repeating my AMH which was normal.  We did high stims antagonist IVF protocol (300 follistim/150 menupur/cetrotide) but that led to me having 2 lead follicles that were growing twice as fast, and 3 that were growing at the pace they should have been at, so we cancelled the IVF and converted to IUI (surprise surprise-the IUI failed).  My FSH was actually normal at the start of this cycle so we were all surprised at how poorly I responded.  The RE has officially put me in the early-DOR camp since my FSH has been dicey, so I feel sad because I am running out of time.   I had an hour long meeting with the RE yesterday about how to proceed and we narrowed it down to 2 options along with a bunch of other variables including throwing in an extra monitoring visit to make sure I'm not stimming too quickly:  Estrogen priming (start estrogen on CD 21 (in +/- 2 weeks) x7 days (I think that's what he said) then lead into an antagonist cycle OR do a short lupron cycle starting on CD 2/no later than 3.  I am thinking of going with the Estrogen priming as my next step because it seems to be the easiest and least stressful, and if it fails, to move on to lupron cycle as our last ditch effort.  \n\nI am wondering if any of you have had any experiences with the estrogen protocol?  I looked in the WWFM sub and had a hard time finding similar protocols.  I'm not looking for successes, rather I'm looking to see how many people have tried this for DOR and if this has at least improved the number of follicles created/eggs retrieved.

These women\u2014so-called \u2018poor responders\u2019\u2014suffer persistently reduced success rates after IVF. Currently, no single intervention is unanimously accepted as beneficial in overcoming poor ovarian response (POR). This has been supported by the available research on POR, which consists mainly of randomized controlled trials (RCTs ) with an inherent high-risk of bias. The aim of this review was to critically appraise the available experimental trials on POR and provide guidance towards more useful\u2014less wasteful\u2014future research.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA comprehensive review was undertaken of RCTs on \u2018poor responders\u2019 published in the last 15 years. Data on various methodological traits as well as important clinical characteristics were extracted from the included studies and summarized, with a view to identifying deficiencies from which lessons can be learned. Based on this analysis, recommendations were provided for further research in this field of assisted conception.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe selected and analysed 75 RCTs. A valid, \u2018low-risk\u2019 randomization method was reported in three out of four RCTs. An improving trend in reporting concealment of patient allocation was also evident over the 15-year period. In contrast, &lt;1 in 10 RCTs \u2018blinded\u2019 patients and &lt;1 in 5 RCTs \u2018blinded\u2019 staff to the proposed intervention. Only 1 in 10 RCTs \u2018blinded\u2019 ultrasound practitioners to patient allocation, when assessing the outcome of early pregnancy. The majority of trials reported an intention-to-treat analysis for at least one of their outcomes, with an improving trend in the recent years. Substantial variation was noted in the definitions used for \u2018poor responders\u2019, the most popular being \u2018low ovarian response at previous stimulation\u2019. The preferred cut-off value for defining previous low response has been \u2018less or equal to three retrieved oocytes\u2019. The most popular tests used for diagnosing diminished ovarian reserve have been antral follicle count and FSH. Although the Bologna criteria for POR were only recently introduced, they are expected to become a popular definition in future \u2018poor responder\u2019 trials. Numerous interventions have been studied on \u2018poor responders\u2019. Most of these have been applied before/during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. The antagonist protocol, the microdose flare protocol and the long down-regulation protocol have been among the most popular interventions. The analysis of outcomes revealed a clear improving trend in reporting live birth. In contrast, only 10% of RCTs reported significant improvement in reproductive outcomes among tested interventions. Twelve \u2018significant\u2019 interventions were reported, each supported by a single \u2018positive\u2019 RCT. Finally, trials of higher methodological quality were more likely to have been published in a high-impact journal.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOverall, the majority of published trials on POR suffer from methodological flaws and are, thus, regarded as being high-risk for bias. The same trials have used a variety of definitions for their poor responders and a variety of interventions for their head-to-head comparisons. Not surprisingly, discrepancies are also evident in the findings of trials comparing similar interventions. Based on the identified deficiencies, this novel type of \u2018methodology and clinical\u2019 review has introduced custom recommendations on how to improve future experimental research in the \u2018poor responder\u2019 population.\n\npoor responder, IVF, RCT, methodology, review, ovarian stimulation, low responder, low response, blinding, live birth", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Thursday Topic: LFOR", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6q13s9/journal_club_thursday_topic_lfor/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "RockyBalboa84", "author_created_utc": 1490391958, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "DOR,MFI,broke ass broad", "author_fullname": "t2_16gvx8", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501227689, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6q2c2h/put_that_tequila_down/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6q2c2h", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6q2c2h/put_that_tequila_down/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "WFuXiCCRZpUIFCX4PdA5ApTnAm1IM6NMwdtaEmqHXa8", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=cdcfd275574b01d73d091d5373024b74", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=8bacf724687c7de86ac769c0989385b7", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=f0cd629e50b76b4c848182976970ad30", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=68a8edfe314d53aa2af8931bf2c8c69e", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=b1d5bad5b3b0ac232882e5a122acb339", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=c7226b6f697aa38ac10c8a1661ac557f", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 720, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/vmWVl1mseLTjT8SedW1p9OnzLr1zHmMrky0b3KDUoG4.jpg?s=1ac7183e9dd1ec8ed649da4b40d47d99", "width": 1280}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1502153802, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "..if you go to Mexico that is.

I was 7 weeks. \n\nMy insurance started calling me to sign me up for their mother and baby program. I ignored the calls but they kept coming so I finally answered and told the lady I had miscarried and to quit calling me about that. She said okay but I still got several more calls trying to sign me up. Finally the last person got what I was saying and removed me from their list. \n\nFigured that was the end of that and then the baby stuff started arriving. I'm now the proud owner of a subscription to parents magazine and some other magazine with family in the name. Both enfamil and similac send me coupons and formula in the mail. \n\nI donated the formula and threw everything else away. \n\nThis march I had an ectopic pregnancy. I didn't even know I was pregnant until we were in the er and the er doctor coldly told me I was pregnant. 2 hours later I wasn't. 4 days later I was down a tube but at least I was out of the hospital. \n\n2 weeks later I started getting the phone calls again from my insurance trying to sign me up for their mother and baby program. Told that lady I had an ectopic and apparently she didn't know what that meant because she tried to tell me about the program. I cut her off and told her I wasn't pregnant and to take me off the list. \n\nA week later a welcome packet came from the insurance telling me about all the benefits I'd receive if I signed up for their program. Keep in mind this isn't Medicaid. This an insurance company we pay for 100% out of pocket and at $1072 a month to cover just my husband and I. \n\nSo a few days later I compose myself enough to call my insurance directly. Tell them I didn't want this stuff and I want to know HOW they got my info. Turns out it's a company my insurance company, and many others, use. They farm out that part to another company. When I got the ultrasound in the hospital. The one that confirmed that my tube had ruptured and that the pregnancy couldn't continue it triggered something in their system to hand over my info to this third party. \n\nNice huh? Something tells me this crap doesn't just happen with my crappy insurance. \n\nSo they took my name off and all has been quiet. Until today. I checked my mail and there's a box from similac telling me all about my toddler and giving me toddler formula and a fruit pouch along with more coupons. \n\nYeah. Thanks for the reminder that I should have a 9 month old who's almost ready for your toddler formula similac. Way to make my day. \n\nI just want to cry. I hate my insurance. I hate similac.

Clinical pregnancy rates were significantly lower for Asian women, specifically in Indian (p &lt; 0.05), Japanese (p &lt; 0.05), and Korean (p &lt; 0.05) women, compared to Caucasian women, even after controlling for endometriosis status.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe prevalence of endometriosis appears to be higher in Filipino, Indian, Japanese, and Korean women presenting for IVF treatment than for Caucasian women; however, the discrepancy in IVF outcomes was conditionally independent of the presence of endometriosis. Future research should focus on improving pregnancy outcomes for Asian populations whether or not they are affected by endometriosis, specifically in the form of longitudinal studies where exposures can be captured prior to endometriosis diagnoses and infertility treatment.\n\n\n\ndoi:10.1007/s10815-017-0919-1", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal Club Friday Topic: Endo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6q84q6/journal_club_friday_topic_endo/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "DFWtransplant", "author_created_utc": 1487782114, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "27F, MFI - Azoo", "author_fullname": "t2_15n1n4", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501293404, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6q8c4v/upcoming_first_re_appointment/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6q8c4v", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6q8c4v/upcoming_first_re_appointment/", "retrieved_on": 1502156802, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc \n\nWe have our first RE appointment coming up on Tuesday and I'm wondering what to expect. Earlier this week we were given news that my husbands SA came with zero sperm and told we should see a urologist. We decided to move to a RE and are assuming we'll be told the same about the urologist but we're hoping to get a recommendation of one from the RE.\n\nWe've been trying for 7 months so literally the only testing we've done is the SA. I'm working on gathering all our medical records but they're pretty boring at this point - a few years worth of normal Pap results for me and just general check up's/physicals for my husband. I haven't been to a general physician in a few years as I didn't have a need. \n\nHas anyone seen an RE with barely any testing before? I'm not sure if we should expect just a lengthy conversation and a referral to a urologist or if I should mentally prepare for an ultrasound/blood work/etc. I hate needles so the sooner I can start calming myself about them the better \ud83d\ude1c \n\nI have pretty regular periods and have been off birth control since November 2016. I plan to bring my printed Fertility Friend charts. According to OPK's and temping, I'm ovulating each month. I've never had any health issues but I'm assuming I'll have some testing at some point, right? \n\nThe health history paperwork we have to fill out is so lengthy and we both have to have the awkward conversation with our parents about our situation this weekend. Both sets of parents knew we were casually trying but thought we were taking more of a \"if it happens, it happens\" approach. Im sure they'll both be caught off guard by hearing 1. We had a SA done and 2. Hubs may or may not have sperm \ud83d\ude11 We need answers from them about family health history so we'll have to break the news to them unfortunately. Hoping they don't continue to pry regularly because we both would prefer to keep this process pretty quiet for now. We're still unsure how open we're willing to be with friends/family, especially when we don't even know what's going to be our game plan. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Upcoming First RE Appointment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6q8c4v/upcoming_first_re_appointment/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "k_snowflake", "author_created_utc": 1483396961, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "35, 2+years, 1 CP, PCOS,limbo. maybe the dingo ate my baby?", "author_fullname": "t2_1436bv", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501305150, "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6q97r6/the_land_of_fertility/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6q97r6", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 37, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6q97r6/the_land_of_fertility/", "retrieved_on": 1502157234, "score": 20, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I seriously wonder what it's like to live in the land of fertility.

My husband and I have been TTC for 2 years. After the first year, my doctor recommended HSG and seaman analysis. The news was less than desirable, but not worst case. We found out I have a blocked tube and his sperm count is low (10-12 million). It's been a difficult journey and along the way, my social media has been littered with happy couples conceiving, most without \"trying\".  Some have hurt more than others, but for the most part, I've been able to breathe, move on and keep focusing on our journey and being as positive as we could.  Our next step is most likely IVF and we scheduled an appointment with a clinic that focuses both on female infertility and male infertility/ endocrinology. Unfortunately, their first availability isn't until October.  I was becoming increasingly depressed with every negative pregnancy test I would take, so together we decided to stop focusing on conceiving for the time being, enjoy our summer and go on some fabulous trips with our friends before we start the heavy hitting topics in the fall. \n\nAll was going fine (at least as fine as can be expected), until yesterday. My best friend, who was also supposed to go on this trip with us, announced that she is pregnant. They hadn't even been trying. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I couldn't speak, move, eat-- really do much of anything. I sobbed and sobbed. She had encouraged me to take this break so we could have this final \"hurrah\", and then this happened. I know she didn't mean to do it on purpose, but I guess it just comes down to me not understanding what it must be like to not have to worry about getting pregnant everyday and for it just to happen out of the blue. The worst part is, she isn't exactly overjoyed. I feel like she won the lottery and is like, \"I have all this money! It sucks!\"  I don't know how to be supportive of her, be there for her, and be happy for her when my heart is in so much pain.  The worst part is how terribly selfish I feel for not being able to be excited for her. I want to be a mother more than anything and it has been quite an uphill journey for us.

(*sarcastic yay*). Not sure if this is the right place for this question but it's a lot more active forum than /r/miscarriage (I mean who wants to hang out there, this is way better right) and I figure a lot of women here have gone through this before here, multiple times. \n\nI had over 2.5 years of infertility trying naturally but conceived recently from my 4th IUI, and have now found out it's inviable (no heartbeat and measuring 6w2d when I was 7w2d).  I have no sign of miscarrying naturally anytime soon - not a single drop of blood. I also conceived from my 1st IUI and that ended in a missed miscarriage at 12.5 weeks (growth stopped 8.5 weeks).  For that one, I was also offered both options but D&amp;C was the obvious choice because (1) my husband was working outside the country at the time and I would be alone, and (2) I was just way too far along (the pregnancy kept developing long after fetal death and I was even showing) so it would undoubtedly be more on the horror story side of things, and (3) it was my first loss and I was beyond freaked out.\n\nNow I'm very confused what to do, because my husband is here, I'm not as far gestated (will be 8w0d when I will make the decision, just waiting a bit and getting one final ultrasound to be extra sure later this week), and while I was scared about scarring mainly after I got the first one (they really downplayed the risk to me at the hospital), I now have legitimate reason to believe I will only have more losses, and would like to reserve the D&amp;C for later losses where using misoprostol would be worse.\n\nPros with D&amp;C:\n\n- physically easy (I had zero pain and very little bleeding last time - and I enjoy general anesthesia. I'm pretty scared of going through labor on misoprostol based on the widely varying internet stories out there, and they are sure to not give me real pain meds here, just paracetamol)\n\n- over with quickly\n\n- could potentially have faster HCG drop and get back to normal quicker - I'm not getting any younger and time is of the essence, and I'll be waiting to start my first IVF cycle\n\nCons with D&amp;C:\n\n- risk of scarring, especially with the fact I now have to face that this will most likely not be my last miscarriage\n\nI didn't seem to have much trouble conceiving by IUI after my first D&amp;C, so I assume adhesions were not a factor (I think? Can they contribute to additional losses after conception?), but I don't know if having a second or third somehow compounds the risk of scarring over the first and second, etc. \n\nAny advice or suggestions as to what I should do?  I keep going back and forth in my head over it and maybe I just need to hear some reassuring stories about misoprostol.  I did actually take misoprostol (although I think a pretty low amount relative to what's taken for doing the full thing) before my D&amp;C. Long story short, it was ridiculously effective at that point (and I only took it once I got to the hospital early) because I already started miscarrying naturally the morning of the procedure, and some very light contractions started but I went under for the D&amp;C before anything really got going so didn't experience the rest.  Plus everything in me was suddenly ready to fall out by the time I took it, which won't be the case now.\n\nUPDATE: Turns out I don't think I can even opt for a D&amp;C when I'm at this gestation here, no choice but misoprostol! (unless I try it first and it fails). 8 week scan of course confirmed again that nothing has happened, my clinic gave me the pills - so I just took a first oral dose of 400 mg (I think this is just to soften things up since I have zero bleeding yet) and start on the vaginal pills tomorrow morning. Will update again what my experience ends up being.  Only have paracetamol and ibuprofen (I bought some OTC codeine in case I get desperate but the only thing available is 500 mg aspirin + 9.6 mg codeine which is like...nothing).  Male doctors are telling me I don't need anything except this...mhm we'll see.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "misoprostol or D&amp;C?

A recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that GnRHa trigger was associated with reduced live birth rates (LBRs) in fresh autologous IVF cycles compared to hCG trigger. However, the evidence is not unequivocal, and recent trials have found encouraging reproductive outcomes among couples undergoing GnRHa trigger and individualized luteal LH activity support. Thus, the aim was to compare GnRHa trigger followed by luteal LH activity support with hCG trigger in IVF patients undergoing fresh embryo transfer.\n\nMaterial and methods\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials published until December 14, 2016. The population was infertile patients submitted to IVF/ICSI cycles with GnRH antagonist cotreatment who underwent fresh embryo transfer. The intervention was GnRHa trigger followed by LH activity luteal phase support (LPS). The comparator was hCG trigger followed by a standard LPS. The critical outcome measures were LBR and OHSS rate. The secondary outcome measures were number of oocytes retrieved, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, and miscarriage rates.\n\nResults\nA total of five studies met the selection criteria comprising a total of 859 patients. The LBR was not significantly different between the GnRHa and hCG trigger groups (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.14). OHSS was reported in a total of 4/413 cases in the GnRHa group compared to 7/413 in the hCG group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.15, 1.60). We observed a slight, but non-significant increase in miscarriage rate in the GnRHa triggered group compared to the hCG group (OR 1.85; 95% CI 0.97, 3.54).\n\nConclusion\nGnRHa trigger with LH activity LPS resulted in comparable LBRs compared to hCG trigger. The most recent trials reported LBRs close to unity indicating that individualization of the LH activity LPS improved the luteal phase deficiency reported in the first GnRHa trigger studies. However, LPS optimization is needed to further limit OHSS in the subgroup of normoresponder patients (&lt;14 follicles\u2009\u2265\u200911\u2009mm).\n\nProspero registration number\nCRD42016051091\n\nKeywords: in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ovarian stimulation, ovulation induction, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist trigger, luteal phase support, live birth rate, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sunday Journal Club Topic: Protocols", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6qke7i/sunday_journal_club_topic_protocols/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "sticksandstring123", "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "secondary if since sept 2017 no diagnoses", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501454087, "domain": "self.infertility", "edited": 1501457648, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6qkeo2/can_we_talk_about_therapy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6qkeo2", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 22, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6qkeo2/can_we_talk_about_therapy/", "retrieved_on": 1502162817, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I have my first appt with a therapist soon. \nI'm going for IF stuff but also general life stuff including my work, which is emotional, and family health anxiety.

Semen quality, a predictor of male fertility, has been suggested declining worldwide [2, 3, 4]. Many factors have been proposed as causes of this decline, including life style habits and trends toward high-protein western\u2013style diets. Thus, given the supposed impact of smoking [5], alcohol consumption [6], weight [7], physical activity [8, 9] and diet [10] on spermatogenesis, the relation between semen parameters and life style has become a topic of interest.\n\nCaffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is found in coffee, tea, soft drinks (particularly cola-containing beverages and energy drinks) and chocolate. It easily crosses biologic membranes, is rapidly distributed throughout the body and has been found in saliva, breast milk, the embryo and the neonate [11]. The caffeine molecule is easily absorbed by humans, having approximately 100% of bioavailability when taken by oral route and reaching a peak in the blood within 15\u201345 min after its consumption [12]. Caffeine has a number of biologic effects, including central nervous system stimulation, increased secretion of catecholamine, relaxation of smooth muscles and stimulation of heart rate. It is known to have both positive and negative effects on health. Whereas a moderate intake may confer a modest protective effect against some cardiovascular system diseases and on the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids (including the various forms of arterial cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia, heart insufficiency, diabetes, liver disease [13] and even Parkinson\u2019s disease [14]), excessive amounts may lead to deleterious health effects [12]. Of particular concern is the increasing consumption of energy drinks, that are rich in caffeine and very popular among young people [15].\n\nMale coffee/caffeine consumption has been associated with high levels of testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) [16]. It has been hypothesized that caffeine alters Sertoli Cells glycolytic and oxidative profile, interfering with male\u2019s reproductive potential [17]. However, the mechanism behind the possible harmful effect of caffeine is not well clarified. In both fetal and adult life, caffeine may act indirectly by impacting the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal-system or by a direct toxic effect on the germinative epithelium [17, 18]. Moreover, coffee consumption has been hypothesized to influence not only semen parameters, but also sperm DNA integrity. This aspect is of potential relevance, considering that human sperm DNA damage can also be determined by testicular or post-testicular injury including oxidative stress [19]. Available evidence indicates that semen samples containing a percentage of DNA fragmented cells above a critical threshold have a reduced level of pregnancy success [20, 21].\n\nTherefore, to summarize the currently available information, we conducted a systematic review of epidemiological data from observational studies on the relation between coffee/caffeine intake and parameters of male fertility including semen quality, sperm ploidy, sperm DNA integrity, and time to pregnancy.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "infertility", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saej", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Journal Club Monday Topic: MFI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6qtq20/journal_club_monday_topic_mfi/", "view_count": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501578514, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.infertility", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6qv1oy/august_waiting_thread/", "id": "6qv1oy", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 140, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/infertility/comments/6qv1oy/august_waiting_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1502294405, "score": 3, "selftext": "Welcome to the monthly waiting thread.

They advised that they would look into it and get back to me. \n\nSo I just got a call from the billing department and they advised that all the abnormal embryo's had been destroyed, But there was still one in storage! It turns out that when they did the PGS there was one that 'didn't have DNA'.\n\nShe advised that a nurse will call me back later to explain this. But what does that mean!? Has anyone done PGS and and had one without DNA? So confused right now... Any info would be appreciated... Thank you\n\nEDIT: So it seems that it was most likely an issue with the sample.... But that was when I asked \"what is usually the issue\". When I was asking specific questions she suggested I make an appointment to see the Dr... Ugh... I was able to make an appointment but it isn't till later in the week...
